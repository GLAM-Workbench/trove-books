PREFACE.
tlio year 1887 the Philatelic Society of London published their work
m °r“ The
Postage Stamps, Envelopes, and Post Cards of Australia, and
the British Colonies of Oceania/' Prior to the publication of that
work, the present writer was seeking for trustworthy information with
reference to the issue of Postage Stamps in New South Wales, a subject
of the deepest interest to Philatelists. The results of his inquiries, at that
time, were embodied in articles published in various Philatelic papers. The
historical portion of “ Oceania '' was disappointing, inasmuch the authors
relied so much on tradition, and one tradition was, that the Sydney Post Office
had been destroyed by fire in 1864. “ Stamps, plates, archives, in fact every-
thing there existing which could have thrown any light upon the subject,
perished in the conflagration !"
In the number of the Philatelic Record for April, 1888, an article, by
F. A. Philbrick, Esq., Q.C., President of the Philatelic Society of London,
appeared, criticising some of my papers, and he there indicated “ what direction
future research might profitably take, in order to place the whole history on a
thoroughly accurate and scientific basis." Profiting by the Suggestions thrown
out, I determined that when the proper time came, I would endeavour to give the
whole of the results of my researches in a complete form. The holding of a
Philatelic Exhibition in London, in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of
the introduction of Postage Stamps in Great Britain, appeared to me to be the
most appropriate time, to carry out this plan. It was only on February 20th,
1890, that I received definite information from the Philatelic Society of London,
that the Exhibition was to be held in May, and on February 24th I waited, by
appointment, on the Hon. Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G., M.P., Premier, who,
knowing the object of my visit, had requested the Hon. Daniel O'Connor,'M.P.'
Postmaster-General, to be present.
a


I placed before these gentlemen the whole question of the advisability of
the Government of New South Wales sending an exhibit to the Exhibition. Sir
Henry, himself an old Philatelist, took the matter up warmly, and after consulta-
tion with Mr. O’Connor, decided that an exhibit should be sent. This was to
consist of a series of photographs, illustrating the present General Post Office,
the old Post Offices, portraits of some of the Postmasters-General, &c., and, in
addition, a history of the Post Office and of the issue of Postage Stamps in New
South Wales was to be prepared. Mr. S. H. Lambton, Secretary to the Post
Office, Mr. Charles Potter, Government Printer and Inspector of Stamps, and
myself were requested to carry out the details of the exhibit. Instructions were
issued, both by the Premier and the Postmaster-General, that every possible
assistance was to be given by all the Departments. As the Exhibition was to
be held in London in May there was no time to be lost. The records had to be
searched, information obtained from every available source, tables compiled, copy
written, photographs taken, plates prepared, and the thousand little details con-
nected with the publication of an illustrated work thought of, and all within the
short space of one month. Under these circumstances, it will be understood
that the volume makes no pretension to literary merit, being, rather, a compilation
from the official records, and as such necessarily involving a certain amount of
repetition.
The earlier history of the Post Office is taken from an old manuscript
volume, dating from 1828 up to 1857, in that Department, in which the
Postmaster-General entered up, from time to time, the leading events as they
happened. It was from this volume that the first report of the Postmaster-
General was compiled; but, unfortunately, many important details were omitted
in that document which I have endeavoured to supply.
The later history is, necessarily, very voluminous, and I have therefore
only given the salient points, which will serve as landmarks for any one wishing
to obtain further information.
In compiling the history of the issue of the Postage Stamps I have care-
fully examined the records in the Colonial Secretary’s Office, the Post Office, and
the Government Printing Office, and from these sources a considerable amount of
valuable and intensely interesting information has been obtained and is now
published for the first time. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the text, some of
the records with reference to the later issues are missing; but, as it is hardly
likely that they have been destroyed, a further search will be made for them.


With reference to the mechanical portion of the work—the plates, most of
which are now published for the first time, have been prepared by the Heliotype
process, which, as the name implies, requires a certain amount of sunshine for
good work to be done. During the past month, however, continuous rains and
cloudy skies have prevailed. Notwithstanding these drawbacks very satisfactory
work has been done.
The blocks used to illustrate the Centennial issue are electrotypes taken
from the original steel dies.
I have to express my obligations to the Staff of the Government Printing
Office for the assistance rendered in the production of the work.
It may be stated here, that where reference is made in the following
pages to “ Oceania/’ the work of the Philatelic Society of London, entitled “ The
Postage Stamps, Envelopes, and Post Cards of Australia, and the British Colonies
of Oceania,” is meant.

HISTORY OF THE POST OFFICE
IN
NEW SOUTH WALES.
fH&pN all civilised states, the establishment of Post Office communication has
pPR been a primary object. It is, therefore, a matter of surprise that in New
South Wales —a colony of Englishmen —it should have been so long
"jA neglected or, rather, allowed to lie dormant. For the first twenty-three
years after the establishment of the Colony, there were no regular Post
Offices, nor did any but the most imperfect means of postal communication exist.
The bulk of the letters circulating consisted of Government despatches and
official communications, and these were forwarded by constables. Occasionally
the settlers were allowed to avail themselves of the same mode of communication.
The earliest mention of postal communication is contained in the Sydney
Gazette for July 10th, 1803, in which is given the Eegulations for the Passage
Boatmen between Sydney and Parramatta, and also a list of charges they were
entitled to make. Amongst other things we find, “ Letters, exclusive of
Government Service, each thus showing that even at this early
date means of postal communication existed, imperfect though they were.
Postal affairs appear to have continued in much the same state until
1809, when, in consequence of the very serious state of matters existing, as
shown by the following General Order, Mr. Nichols was practically appointed
Postmaster, and a code of regulations drawn up :
Headquarters, 25 April, 1809.
Complaints have been made to the Lieut.-Governor that numerous frauds had been
committed by individuals repairing on board ships on their arrival at this port, and
personating others, by which they have obtained possession of letters and parcels, to the
great injury of those for whom they were intended.
The Lieut.-Governor, in order to prevent the practice of such frauds in future,
has been pleased to establish an office at which all parcels and letters addressed to the
inhabitants of this Colony are to be deposited previous to their distribution, which office
shall be under the direction of Mr. Isaac Nichols, Assistant to the Naval Officer, who
has entered into security for the faithful discharge of the trust reposed in him.
A


The following regulations are, therefore, to be observed, viz. ;
On the arrival of any vessel, Mr. Nichols, or a person properly authorised by
him, is to repair on board, and to require that all letters and parcels
directed for the Colony be delivered to him, for which he is to give a
receipt to the master, mate, or supercargo.
An office for their reception shall be established at his house, and in considera-
tion of the trouble and expense attended on the duty, the following sums
shall be charged by him on their delivery, viz. :
For every letter, Is.
For every parcel not exceeding 20 K). weight, 2s, 6d., and
For all exceeding that weight, ss.
A list to be published in the Gazette of the names of persons to whom letters
and parcels are directed.
Soldiers’ letters (agreeable to the established regulations) to be charged only
one penny.
In 1810, Governor Macquarie, with a view to the convenience and general
accommodation of the inhabitants, deemed it expedient to establish a regular
Post Office in the town of Sydney, in which all parcels or letters, either colonial or
foreign, were ordered to be deposited, previous to their distribution.
Mr. Isaac Nichols was then permanently appointed Postmaster. The
following is the Government order;— TT , x „ , T t
Headquarters, Government House,
n n j 23 June, 1810.
Government Order.
Tx order to the convenience and general accommodation of the inhabitants of the Colony,
His Excellency the Governor has deemed it expedient to establish a regular Post Office in
the town of Sydney, at which all parcels or letters, either colonial or foreign, are to be
deposited previous to their distribution. His Excellency lias accordingly been pleased to
appoint Mr. Isaac Nichols to be Postmaster—Mr. Nichols having entered into security of
live hundred pounds for the faithful discharge of the trust reposed in him.
The following regulations are therefore to be strictly observed, viz. :
First.—On the arrival of any ship or vessel in the harbour, Mr. Nichols (or a
person properly authorised by him) is to repair on board, and to require
that all letters and parcels directed for the Colony (public Government
despatches excepted) shall be delivered to him, for which he is to give a
receipt to the master, mate, or supercargo.
Secondly.—An office for the reception of all letters and parcels shall be
established from the 25th instant, at the house of Mr. Nichols, in High-
street, and in consideration of the expense and trouble attendant on this
duty, the following sums shall be charged by him on their delivery, viz. :
For every letter, English or foreign, eight-pence ; for every parcel not
exceeding 20 R). weight, one shilling and six-pence ; for all parcels exceeding
20 fb. weight, three shillings ; and for every colonial letter from any part of
the territory, four-pence. Soldiers’ letters and those addressed to their wives
(agreeably to the established regulations) to be charged only one penny.
Thirdly.—A list is to be published in the Gazette of the names of the persons
to whom letters and parcels are directed.
By command of His Excellency,
(Signed) J. T. Campbell,
Secretary.


We are fortunately able to give an illustration of this Post Office. The house,
which stood in George-street (at that time called High-street), near the Queen’s
Wharf, has only recently been demolished. Over the door, engraved on the
keystone, are the letters “ I. N., 1809,” and these may easily be deciphered in
the picture.
This office appears to have been established merely for the distribution of
letters and parcels arriving in Sydney, their conveyance to and from the interior
depending as heretofore on constables and private individuals, no arrangement,
apparently, having been made for the despatch of ship letters. Mr. Nichols died
on November Bth, 1819. The newspaper of the day says of him :
He was the first who received the very useful and much required office of Post-
master, the duties of which office he has performed highly to the general satisfaction
during the last eight or nine years of his lifetime,
Among the General Orders in the same issue of the Gazette, bearing date
I riday, November 12th, 1819, is one notifying that
George Panton, Esq., is to be Postmaster of the Territory of New South Wales, in the
room of Mr. Isaac Nichols, deceased. Mr. Panton is to take charge of this Department
on Monday next, the 15th instant.
In addition, he held the office of wharfinger, transacting both those duties in a
small apartment on the King’s Wharf, which was afterwards the office of the
landing-waiter.
Though the population was fast increasing, and in 1821 amounted to
nearly 30,000, no measures towards additional postal communication appear to
have been taken until the year 1825, when an Act was passed by Sir Thomas
Brisbane, with the advice of the Council, intituled, “An Act to regulate the
1 ostage of Letters in New South 7 Vales.” This Act, after referring to one passed
by the Imperial Parliament in the reign of Queen Anne, authorising the estab-
lishment of a General Post Office for all Her Majesty’s dominions, and the
appointment of a Postmaster-General, with power to “ settle” Posts for the carry-
ing and receiving of all letters to and from all parts of Her Majesty’s dominions,
continues to state that no Post having been established by the Postmaster-
General of Great Britain in New South Wales, it was expedient to provide for the
temporary postage and conveyance of letters until a Post should be so established.
The Act gave the person administering the Government of the Colony for
the time being, power to establish Post Offices in Sydney, and in any other parts
of the Colony, and to fix the rates of postage; such rates being, however, settled
and appointed according to the rates charged in England, as nearly as circum-
stances would admit.


It also gave the Governor power to appoint Postmasters in Sydney and
elsewhere, at such salaries and allowances as he might deem reasonable ; and
enacted that all rates of postage collected by them should be accounted for, and
paid into the Colonial Treasury. Bigge, in his “ Report on the State of
Agriculture and Trade in the Colony of New South Wales/'’ ordered by the
House of Commons to be printed, March 13th, 1823 —speaking of the sources of
revenue in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land :
Another source of revenue in the two colonies may hereafter be found in the
shape of postage for the conveyance of letters. Postmasters have been appointed both
at Sydney and Hobart Town, and they receive the letters that arrive from England, and
that are authorised by a late regulation of Governor Macquarie, published in the Sydney
Gazette , and dated on the 3rd June, 1820, to charge the sum of Bd. for postage upon all
single letters, to or from Britain, India, or foreign places, with an increase of rate upon
double letters.
An inland postage is likewise chargeable for letters dii’ected to the inhabitants of
the different districts in the Colony, but they are only transmitted when opportunities
occur, or are casually delivei’ed to the more respectable inhabitants of Sydney. A list
of all the names of persons to whom letters are addressed is exhibited at the Post Office,
and was formerly published in the Gazette ; but as the number of letters increased, and
frequently were not called for, the Postmaster found that the expense of this mode of
publication of the names increased in a greater proportion than his fees, and letters are
now left at the Post Office in Sydney and Hobart Town, till they are called and paid for.
The annual amount of letters received at Sydney was estimated in the year 1821 to be
between 1,000 and 1,200 ; but 1 have reason to believe that from accidental causes, and
want of means of transmission in the Colony, rather than from any neglect in the Post-
master, a great many of those addressed to the convicts do not reach their destination.
Their change of abode from the service of one master to another, and their removals on
account of punishment, make it very difficult, and indeed impossible, for any person that
is not connected with the superintendence of the convicts, to find out the actual residence
of a person of that class. The establishment of a regular communication by a post
conveyed on horseback from Sydney to Parramatta, and from thence to Windsor, would
be beneficially felt at present, and would relieve the constables from a great deal of duty
that now improperly devolves upon them. I conceive that the rates of postage allowed
by the order of Governor Macquarie would defray the expense incurred for the pay and
subsistence of two men and horses, travelling constantly, three times a week, between
those places, and lay the foundation of a new source of revenue to the Colony. The
annual profits of the situation of Postmaster at Sydney are stated by him not to exceed
£lOO, and I submit that all postage received beyond that sum should be accounted for
to the Colonial Treasurer; and that with a view to check the account, a statement of the
number of letters transmitted in every letter-bag to New South Wales or Van Diemen’s
Land, shall be forwarded to the Colonial Secretary.
Very shortly after the passing of his Postal Act, Sir Thomas Brisbane
retired from the Government of the Colony, and was succeeded pro tem. by the
Lieutenant-Governor, Colonel Stewart, of the 3rd Buffs, the Commander of the
Forces.


The Acting-Governor issued, on December 16th of the same year, a
Proclamation which fixed the rates of postage and the salaries and allowances of
the Postmasters, and which also established regulations for their guidance.
At the same time, parties were invited to tender for the conveyance of
mails between Sydney and Parramatta, Windsor and Liverpool, and between
Liverpool and Campbelltown, and from Parramatta to Emu Plains (Penrith),
and thence to Bathurst.
The rates of postage were regulated by the Proclamation in question,
according to the offices between which the letters passed, the rate depending
apparently on the distance and difficulty of transmission.
The lowest single inland rate was 3d., and the highest ] 2d., the postage
on a letter increasing in proportion to its weight, which was fixed for a single
letter at £ oz.
Letters to and from New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land were
subjected to a charge of 3d. each (ship rate); newspapers to that of Id.; other
ship letters were charged 4d. single rate, and 6d. for any weight in excess, in
addition to the inland rate of postage. Parcels of newspapers, printed prices
Current, or other periodical publications, were charged a rate of postage of Id.
for every 4 oz.; but if forwarded from or to the interior, double that rate.
In all cases where letters were despatched from the Colony, the postage
had to be paid in advance. The privilege of franking was granted by this
Proclamation to the chief public officers of the Colony, as follows, viz. ; —The
Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the judges of the Supreme Court, the
Venerable the Archdeacon, the Colonial Secretary, the Principal Surgeon, the
Surveyor-General, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer, the Chief
Engineer, the Private Secretary to the Governor, the Officer in charge of the
Commissariat Department, the Superintending Magistrate of Police, the Auditor
of Public Accounts, the Clerk of the Council, the Principal Superintendent of
Convicts at Sydney. Letters to or from convicts likewise passed free under
certain regulations.
Letters from or to soldiers and sailors were subject, as at first, to a rate
of Id., according to the well-known Imperial practice.
Masters of vessels were entitled to receive a gratuity of Id. for each
letter, and 2d. for each parcel, “as an encouragement ” to them to deliver up


such letters and parcels immediately on arrival. The Proclamation also granted
to the principal and other postmasters, in lieu of salary, a commission of 10 per
cent, on the amount of postage collected by them respectively.
This percentage was granted subject to reconsideration ; and in the event
of the amount received by these officers not realising a sum afterwards to be
determined upon, then the deficiency was to be made good from the Colonial
Treasury.
It does not appear that Colonel Stewart’s Proclamation was immediately
acted on, or at all events not as regarded all its provisions; the delay being
apparently occasioned by a difficulty in obtaining tenders for the conveyance of
the mails.
Immediately after the publication of the Proclamation, an advertisement
calling for tenders for the conveyance of mails was inserted in the Gazette, but
no tenders appear to have been sent in, nor did a further advertisement, inserted
after the arrival of Sir Ralph Darling, as Governor, meet with more success.
One of the conditions was that the mails were to be “ conveyed to and from
Sydney to Parramatta, Windsor, and Liverpool, either by the coaches passing
between these places, or by gigs, or other light vehicles, travelling at the rate of
7 miles in the hour.” The rate to be allowed was Id. for each letter so conveyed,
and 2d. for each parcel.
On December 12th, 1827, another advertisement was inserted, and, from
the arrangement made the following year, appears to have led to a practical result.
It is not very clear, however, to what extent the provisions of the
Proclamation of 1825 were, in the first instance, carried out.
From the peremptory wording of the Proclamation, it is presumable that
the rates of postage mentioned therein, were those collected; and that all postage
received by the Sydney Postmaster (the only one then appointed) was paid by
him into the Colonial Treasury, the Postmaster receiving an allowance of 10 per
cent, on the same, together with some additional aid from the Government, the
amount of which is not known, but which did not, in all probability, exceed
£4OO per annum. The official arrangements for carrying into effect all the
provisions of the Proclamation of the 16th December, 1825, having been
completed, a Government Order was issued on March Bth, 1828, appointing Post-
masters at Bathurst, Campbelltown, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith, and Windsor,
and made arrangements for the conveyance of the mails either by contract with
private individuals or by means of the mounted police.


Several deviations from the original plan, as laid down in the Proclama-
tion, appear, however, to have taken place on the establishment of the country
Post Offices. The Postmasters, instead of being allowed 10 per cent, on the
postage collected by them, received only 5 per cent, for the year 1828 ; but this
percentage was augmented in the following year to 20 per cent.
During the year 1825 General Darling, the Governor of New South Wales,
visited Hobart Town, and proclaimed the independence of Van Diemen's Land on
December 3rd.
The allowances received by the eight country Postmasters in lieu of
salary during 1828 were sums varying from 3s. lOd. to £lO ss. lid.; the total
amount received by them collectively during the year being only £34 7s. 9d.
The Postmaster-General received in lieu of percentage or allowances of
any kind a salary of £4OO per annum.
The postal establishment of Sydney consisted at this time of one principal
Postmaster (or as he is frequently, but not always, designated in the various
documents Postmaster-General), one clerk, one letter-carrier, and in addition to
the eight country Postmasters there was a letter-carrier appointed for Parramatta,
who was authorised to demand Id. from the public on every letter delivered
by him, and this payment was the only remuneration received. The number of
miles travelled by the mails during this year was (exclusive of water carriage)
40,560. The Post Office revenue being £598 2s. 4^d.
On March 3rd, 1828, daily mails commenced being forwarded from the
Post Office in Bent-street to Parramatta and Liverpool, to Windsor and Campbell-
town twice a week, to Newcastle, per “ Lord Liverpool,” packet, twice a week,
and to Penrith and Bathurst once a week. This Bent-street Post Office was at
the rear of the present Department of Public Instruction. Some years ago the
City Council ordered the wall at the rear of what was then the Colonial Secretary’s
Office to be removed and carried back, so as to widen the footpath in that part of
Bent-street. The carrying out of this, led to the demolition of this Post Office.
“ The Post Office proper was simply a wooden structure like a painted doorway,
or a military sentry-box set into the wall to the right of the main gate.” To
the rear of the sentry-box was a small wooden shed to contain the postmaster
and his letter-bags while he was engaged in “ sorting.” “ Indeed, so small were
the whole premises, that if the mail happened to be unusually bulky some portion
was taken to the Post Office, while the balance was carried on the shoulders of the
sailors to the private residence of Mr. Panton, then overlooking Campbell's Wharf.”


In 1829, great improvement became visible, and in tbe country towns the
inhabitants began to look forward to the arrival of the mails with some degree
of anxiety.
On April 24th, 1829, Mr. Panton died at the age of 43. Mr, James Raymond
was gazetted as his successor, on April 27th. The Gazette of April 30th, 1829,
contains this notice of the appointment .
The Post Office. —The appointment of Mr. Raymond to the office of Postmaster
affords us the highest satisfaction, for we know him to be eminently qualified for that
important and responsible post. His habits of business are quick, spirited, methodical
and persevering. We fully rely upon his giving to his new department the most comp e e
efficiency.
In 1830, the extension of the establishment throughout the entire located
parts of the Colony became general; from Port Macquarie, the northern boundary,
to Inverary, 120 miles from Sydney to the southward, and to Wellington \ alloy,
238 miles to the westward, exercising its influence, and possessing all the elements
of a well-organised post; the mails regularly conveyed from the General Post
Office now removed from Bont-street to a handsome budding in the centre o
George-street, in well-appointed coaches and four. This building was formerly
occupied as the Police Office, and is well depicted in the accompanying engraving.
The land upon which it stood, and which is a portion of that on which the
present Post Office stands, “was bought,” according to the evidence r.

A gratuity of 2d. was allowed for every letter bearing postage conveyed
by water between Sydney and Newcastle. Soldiers’ letters were delivered free of
charge on arrival in the Colony ; but were subject to Id. each for despatch. The
letter-carrier first wore a uniform in this year.
During 1831, further improvements were effected by the establishment of
a regular Two-penny Post delivery, twice a day, throughout Sydney, and unpaid
« receipt boxes ” were fixed at different parts of the town, and visited and emptied
twice a day, immediately before the general delivery, by messengers from the
Central Post Office; hut the only place where letters could be post paid was the
General Post Office.
The following notice, which was issued at that time, is interesting
From the great extent of Sydney, reaching from Dawes’ Battery to the Turnpike, a
distance of” miles, and the number of intersecting streets, . » desirable that letters put
d,stance ™ ’ h ld b( . corre ctly directed ; and that clerks, shopmen and servants
should cause* as Uttle delay as the letter-carriers when they call for delivery.


As wc shall subsequently see this led to the introduction of the system of
prepaying letters by stamps, in order to do away with the delay consequent on
the letter-carriers being compelled to wait for payment at every house.
The mails hitherto transmitted to Newcastle by sailing vessels were in
1802 conveyed by steamers plying twice a week. These were the u Sophia
Jane,” of 153 tons, and the “ William the Fourth,” of 58 tons.
Xn 1804 the services of the mounted police in convcving the mails were
dispensed with ; contracts being taken for the conveyance of all inland mails.
In 1835 Sir Richard Bourke, then Governor-in-Chief, deeming it expedient
to provide in a more ample manner for the conveyance and postage of letters,
framed, with the advice of the Legislative Council, an Act intituled “ An Act to
provide for the conveyance and postage of letters ,” by which the former Act,
Iramed by Sir Thomas Brisbane in 1825, was repealed.
The new Act increased the weight of a single letter from | oz. to any
weight under the % oz. Ihe rates of postage on inland letters were made charge-
able according to weight and to the distance carried. Thus the charge on a
single letter
Conveyed 15 miles was 4d.

And Id. additional for every extra 100 miles, or part thereof.
For every packet forwarded from one part of the Colony to another, 4d.
was charged. Newspapers were allowed to pass free, if posted within seven
days from the date of publication ; otherwise they were charged as a single letter.
Every packet, letter, or newspaper posted for town delivery in Sydney,
not exceeding 4 oz. in weight, was charged 2d., and for every letter or packet
put into a Post Office, for delivery at such office, Id,
Ship letters, either despatched or received, were charged, in addition to
the inland postage, for a single letter 3d., double letter 4d., treble letter 5d.,
quadruple (or any greater weight) 6d.
P


The general tendency of this new Act was to reduce the rates of postage
on letters both inland and ship, and to abolish the tax on newspapers, if posted
within a given time.
Patterns of merchandise, not weighing more than 4 oz,, were chargeable
as single letters. This Act was the first that compelled masters of vessels, under
a penalty, to deliver up immediately, on arrival, all mails brought by them, and
to take charge, when required to do so, of all outward mails on their departure
from the Colony, As a remuneration for their services they were paid Id. on each
letter received and despatched. On Government despatches, however, no charge
was made.
By the same Act, the privilege of franking was extended to members of
the Executive and Legislative Councils. Provision was also made for the disposal
of unclaimed letters; and penalties were enacted against contractors failing to
perform their contracts, and against persons obstructing or delaying the mails.
The Act also conferred on the Post Office the exclusive right to convey letters or
packets for hire, weighing not more than 9 oz. Letters exceeding that weight,
letters sent with goods, letters containing writs of proceedings of any court of
justice, or deed, conveyance, affidavit, or letter of attorney, letters sent by any
person concerning his or her private affairs by any special messenger, or letters
bond fide conveyed to or from a Post Office, or to or from any place distant
5 miles or upwards from any Post Office were made exceptions to the law.
The Act was to become null and void in the event of His Majesty’s Post-
master-General deeming it expedient to erect and “ settle” a post in the Colony.
In 1836 the establishment which had hitherto (with the exception of the first
year) been a paying one, ceased to be so, not that the revenue had decreased, but
that the general expenditure had increased in a greater ratio.
In 1837 a Post Office was established at Melbourne, which city received its
name on April 10th, 1837, and mail communication was established by water as
opportunities offered. In 1838 overland communication with that place was
established, the mail to run once a fortnight between Yass and Melbourne. It
was during this year that an almost daily communication by steam with the
Hunter Piver commenced, and that a second daily mail was despatched to
Parramatta by the river steamers. Stamped covers were also introduced and
sold at Is. 3d. per dozen; and a letter enclosed therein was allowed to pass
free in Sydney. These continued in use until 1852,


An Act was passed during 1838 by Sir George Gipps amending in some
particulars tlio former one passed under the Government of Sir Richard Bourkc.
The alteration consisted in an increase of the rates of postage on ship letters or
packets; 3d. continued as formerly the charge for a single letter weighing less
than oz.; but the scale of charges on letters of greater weight was increased as
follows, viz. : For a double one, 6d.; for a treble one, 9d.; for a quadruple one,
Is.; and 2d. extra for every additional weight. The total charge on any letter,
however, was not to exceed 2s. 6d. The Postal Establishment in 1838, though
small, had already increased greatly.
The revenue, which in 1828—that being the year in which the Depart-
ment was first officially recognised as a Government establishment—was only
£598 2s. had increased to £8,390 16s. lid.; while the expenditure, which
in the former case was only £B9O ss. B|d., had augmented to £10,357 Is. 6d.
The number of Post Ofiices established by the end of 1838 was 40—five
times as many as existed ten years previously; and the number of miles travelled
by the mails in the year, exclusive of water carriage, was 253,830, against 40,560
miles travelled in 1828.
The number of chargeable letters and newspapers despatched to, and
received from, Great Britain and foreign parts was, in 1838, 221,479, against
14,807 in 1829—n0 record having been kept of the number of letters and news-
papers that passed through the office in 1828.
168,551 inland letters and 297,245 inland newspapers passed through the
Department in this year, against 15,598 letters and 34,832 newspapers in 1829.
The increase in the number of franked letters was likewise great, the number
being 84,775, against 38,659 in 1829.
The first record of town letters appears in this year, during which 14,967
were delivered.
It will be noticed that in the year 1829 the franked letters form the
largest item in the return, whilst in 1838 they are the smallest.
The Sydney Establishment consisted, in this year, of—
-1 Postmaster-General.
1 Accountant.
6 Clerks.
6 Letter-carriers.
1 Office-keeper.
Total, 15


In 1839 the daily delivery by a postman on horseback was extended to
Darlinghurst, Surry Hills, and Newtown.
New Zealand became a separate colony in 1841, notice to this effect
haying been received from the Colonial Secretary on May 21st; and the Post
Office situated at Korrarika, which had previously been paid through the New
South Wales Government, ceased, in consequence, to have any connexion with the
Sydney Office.
On June 10th, 1841, steam communication with Melbourne was established
by the “ Sea Horse,” and the postage rates thereto were made the same by sea
as overland, viz., Is. 3d. the single letter; the revenue thereby increasing con-
siderably. On January 21st, 1842, the first steamboat started for Moreton Bay.
In 1844, two commissioners—E. D. James and R. R. Smith, Esqs. —were sent
out by the authorities of the Loudon Post Office to inquire into the state of
the Postal Establishment in this Colony, with a view of placing it under the
control of the Postmaster-General of the United Kingdom. Their visit, how-
ever, brought no such result, the office remaining under local control. Their
report does not appear to have been published; but Mr. R. A. Hunt states that
when in England, in 1856, he saw the papers in the Colonial Office.
On June 11th, 1844, the first monthly contract packet, the “ Mary Sharp,”
arrived from the United Kingdom.
In 1847, sundry improvements were effected in the structure of the Post
Office. A handsome portico was erected, six doric columns supporting an
appropriate entablature and pediment, with the Royal Arms (executed by Mr.
Abraham) in the centre of the tympanum. Of this, we give an illustration.
(Plate IY.) The right centre window of the upper storey was that of the room
in which the “ Sydney Views ” were printed.
On January Ist, 1847, the first overland mail to Adelaide was despatched;
the distance being 750 miles. This mail was transmitted via Melbourne, and
thence forwarded to Mount Gambier Post Office, on the boundary line of the
Colony, where it was received by mounted troopers in the pay of the South
Australian Government. The postage rate from or to Sydney and Adelaide, on
a single letter, was Is. 6d.
The Post Office Department, which since 1844 had produced a net
revenue, again became non-paying. In 1849, during the Government of Sir
C. A. Eitzroy, an Act to establish an uniform rate of postage and to consolidate


and amend the law for the conveyance and postage of letters was passed. This
Act repealed all former ones. The weight of a letter charged with a single rate
of postage was now fixed at \ oz. The postage on inland letters was made 2d.,
and on town letters Id. The postage on ship letters was fixed at 3d. (in addition
to any inland rate), and was payable on receipt or despatch from the Colony, and
was independent of the postage chargeable in countries whence received or to
which addressed. Bankers’ parcels, patterns, prices current, writs, or proceedings
of courts of justice, Legislative papers, and periodical publications were allowed
by the new Act to circulate at the rate of 2d. for every packet weighing not more
than 4 oz.; Id. being charged for every additional 2 oz. The Governor-General
was authorised to have postage stamps struck off.
The privilege of franking was abolished; and petitions to the Queen, the
Governor-General, the Executive and Legislative Councils, only were allowed to
pass free. Newspapers were again subject to a tax of Id. The registration of
letters was by this Act placed on a better footing. The exclusive right conferred
on the Post Office to transmit letters and packets for hire was now extended from
the weight of 4to 16 oz.; but was subject to the same exceptions as specified
in the former Act. The new Act was not to abridge or interfere in any way
with the powers vested in the Postmaster-General of the United Kingdom, or in
the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury.
In 1851, gold was discovered in the Colony; Port Phillip was also separated
from New South Wales on the Ist July—the new Colony receiving the name of
Victoria; and, as a necessary consequence, the Melbourne, and all Post Offices
in that district ceased to be under the supervision of the General Post Office in
Sydney. It was in this year —which appears to have been a very eventful one
for the Post Office Department in this Colony—that a Board was appointed by
the Governor-General to inquire into its state and general management. The
recommendations of the Post Office Board were, to the effect that the Department
should be completely reorganised, and placed under the control of another
Postmaster-General; and that the then Postmaster-General should be allowed to
“retire on a pension of such amount as his long public services might justly
entitle him to receive.” The decease of Mr. Raymond, on May 29th, 1851,
however, took place before the recommendations of the Board were officially
carried out, and Mr. F. L. S. Merewether was appointed to succeed that officer.
It was deemed expedient to frame a new Act, intituled, “An Act to
Consolidate and Amend the Law for Conveyance and Postage of Letters and by


which all former Acts were repealed. Postmasters were authorised by this Act
to refuse every packet or letter weighing more than 10 oz., or reasonably
suspected to contain anything likely to injure the contents of the mails.
Newspapers were again to pass free if posted within seven days from tho
date of publication. Prepayment of postage on inland letters (with some relaxa-
tion in favour of letters not grossly deficient in postage) was made compulsory,
as was also the case with ship letters, those to or from the United Kingdom
excepted.
The Postmaster-General was authorised to destroy all printed documents,
patterns, &c., remaining unclaimed for three months, and all letters remaining
for one year. It was also enacted that the postage on letters and packets passing
between New South Wales and Victoria should continue the same as if the
colonies had not been separated, provided that the rates of postage chargeable
in the latter colony upon letters addressed to the former should not exceed the
rates established for New South Wales. This contemplated contingency actually
occurred in a subsequent year, and in consequence of higher postage rates being
established in Victoria notice was given to the public of New South Wales that
the arrangement above alluded to would cease on the Ist July, 1854. From that
period the ship rate of postage to the colony of Victoria was the same as that
required on letters despatched to foreign countries or to any other British colony.
On the Ist May, 1852, compulsory prepayment of postage by stamps took
place, and it may be noted that the colonists appeared so fully prepared for the
change that little practical inconvenience ensued on the introduction of this new
system.
At the same period Mr. Mcrewether was appointed Auditor-General of the
Colony, and Major W. H. Christie succeeded him in the office of Postmaster-
General.
An Act was passed in December, 1852, amending in some particulars the
former one. Books, maps, charts, and music were allowed to circulate in the
Colony at the reduced rate of postage. These articles were likewise allowed to
circulate between this Colony and Victoria without any charge on delivery,
provided always that the postage had been paid at the office whence despatched.
By this Act also the charge on gold transmitted was made double that payable
on letters, and facilities were afforded to the Post Office to discover such packets.
The “ Chusan,” bringing the first mails ever received in Australia by steam,
in conjunction with the overland route, arrived on the 3rd of August of this year,


In 1854 an additional Postage Act was passed, amending the preceding
one. The power to make arrangements with the neighbouring Colonies for the
mutual exemption of postage on the delivery of prepaid letters was given, and in
consequence arrangements were shortly afterwards completed by which letters
passing between New South Wales and the neighbouring Colonies (with the
exception of New Zealand, which had not reciprocated the privilege afforded by
this Colony), were exempt from all charge on delivery, provided they had been
regularly posted at the office of despatch. The amended Act likewise allowed
manuscript and printed matter to pass at the reduced rate of postage; and also
enacted that newspapers stitched in monthly parts should be transmitted at the
charge of Id. for each number contained in such parts.
Since 1852 the Colonial Government had been in communication with the
Imperial one, relative to the establishment of an uniform rate of postage on
letters passing between the Colony and the United Kingdom ; but it was only in
this year that arrangements were finally concluded for carrying into effect that
measure.
Letters were by this arrangement allowed to pass between the Colony and
the United Kingdom at the uniform rate of 6d. for the single letter of oz.,
prepayment of the postage being optional. As the British Government bore the
expense of the conveyance of these mails, they were entitled by this arrangement
to receive, for letters conveyed by the contract packets, five-sixths of the postage
chargeable, the Colony receiving the remaining one-sixth. The postage on letters
conveyed by private ships was to be equally divided between the two Govern-
ments. The arrangements had scarcely come into operation, however, when it
was notified by the Home Government that the exigencies of the war in the East
would occasion the withdrawal of the steamers hitherto employed in conveying
the Australian mails; and the consequence was, that contracts were entered into
by the British Government with the owners of sailing vessels for the conveyance
of the mails monthly to and from Melbourne and the United Kingdom. In the
first instance, from the selection of the vessels to convey the mails not being good,
this substituted arrangement gave great dissatisfaction to the colonists ; and
although advantage was subsequently taken of the clipper ships belonging to the
Black Ball and White Star lines of packets trading to Australia, and which
packets performed the mail service in a creditable manner, the renewal of the
postal communication with Europe by steam continued to be looked forward to
with the greatest anxiety, and was hailed in New South Wales with the liveliest
satisfaction,


The year 1855 was a memorable one, not only to the colonists, but also to
the Post Office Department, as being that in which the important benefit of
conveyance of mails by railway was initiated. On the Ist October, 1855, in
addition to the mail for Parramatta, mails for intermediate Post Offices were
transmitted by rail, instead of by the usual wheeled carriages.
In 1855, the value of postage stamps sold in Sydney and issued to the
Country Postmasters amounted to £26,476 17s. lid., being a larger amount by
£3,160 19s. lid. than that received for stamps in 1854.
The population of the Colony in 1856, according to the census taken in
that year, was 266,189, and the proportion of letters to population was 10 £ to
each person. About 2,817,448 letters and 1,726,619 newspapers were delivered.
A contract was entered into by the Imperial Government with the European
and Australian Royal Mail Company for the conveyance of the mails between
the Australian Colonies and the United Kingdom, by the Overland Route, for a
period of five years, at an annual subsidy of £185,000. The Company were
bound by their contract to convey the mails to and from the United Kingdom
and Sydney once a month, the outward voyage to be performed in 58 days, and
that from Sydney to Southampton in 56 days. The service commenced on the
14th October, 1856.
It was now felt that the Post Office building was too small, and, more-
over, it was so frail and dilapidated that it was often a matter of serious
consideration whether, in any extensions, a new doorway could be opened with
safety. As there was no strong room in the General Post Office, and no
accommodation for the documents and books that had been accumulating for 28
years, it is but little to be wondered at that the official records are now so
faulty. In 1857, the new mail service did not give satisfaction. Only ten monthly
mail steamers arrived in the Colony, and only eleven were despatched, instead of
twelve. Indeed, the whole service was nothing but a series of disasters and
irregularities. The want of punctuality in the performance of the mail contract
had naturally led the Colony to consider what means should be adopted to
establish a more satisfactory communication with Great Britain ; and it chanced
that, prior to the Postal Conference which was held in June 1856, Mr. Champion
Wetton, an agent of the Royal Mail Company, together with Mr. Dillon Bell,
a delegate from the New Zealand Government, visited Sydney with a view
of arranging the establishment of steam communication via Panama, An
arrangement was concluded with the agent, but it was not ratified by the
directors of the Royal Mail Company.


In this year a great improvement was made in the obliterating stamps, so
as to prevent the postage stamps being used again and the revenue defrauded ;
and as a check on individual Post Offices, the obliterating stamps of each office
had a different number.
By the returns for 1858, it appears that 3,551,773 letters, packets, and
book packets passed through the Post Offices of the Colony, and 2,808,140 news-
papers. 95,199 registered letters passed through the General Post Office in the
year. Gold escorts were also regularly established. The revenue for the year
amounted to £39,953 15s. Bd., and the expenditure to £69,507 16s. Bd. The
number of Colonial Post Offices on the 31st December was 221.
During the last eight months of 1859 the Peninsular and Oriental
Company's vessels brought the mails, but in no single instance during the year
did they arrive on the day specified.
On December 10th, 1859, Queensland became a separate colony, and
commenced the issue of postage stamps on November Ist, 1860.
In 1860 provision was made that postage stamps which were not soiled or
defaced could be exchanged for money.
In the early part of 1862 a Board was appointed to inquire into the whole
management and working of the Post Office Department. Their chief recom-
mendations were that a new Post Office should be erected, and that the situation
of Postmaster-General should be a political and independent office.
In October, 1863, the old Post Office building in George-street was
abandoned, and the Department moved into a temporary building in Wynyard-
square, of which we give an illustration. (Plate IV.) A recent writer says :
In reference to this temporary Post Office rather an amusing error occurs in “ A
Boy’s Voyage Round the World,” edited by Samuel Smiles. The work is compiled from
notes made by his son during a trip made about the year 1870. The youthful critic,
after drawing a few comparisons between Melbourne and Sydney (greatly to the
disparagement of the latter), goes on to say :
Instead of the splendidly-broad, well-paved, and well-watered streets of Melbourne, here they
are narrow, ill-paved, and dirty. Such a thing as the miserable wooden hut which serves for a Post
C


Office would not be allowed to exist for a day at Melbourne. It is the original office , and has never heen
altered or improved since it was first put up (!) I must, however, acknowledge that a new Post Office is
in course of erection; but it shows the want of public spirit in the place, that the old shanty should
have been allowed to stand so long!
In 1864 an Act was passed, imposing, on and after the Ist April, a charge
of Id. each upon all newspapers posted within the Colony. On the Ist October,
1865, in consequence of the retirement of Major Christie, the Government
determined to carry out the recommendation of the Post Office Board of 1862,
and make the office a political one. The first political head was the Hon. J. A.
Cunneen. Upon the Postmaster-General becoming an independent officer, the
Money Order Department (which had been established in October, 1862, under
the superintendence of Mr. F. W. Hill), formerly under the honorable the
Treasurer, was placed under his control.
The arrangements for the new postal route to Europe and America, via
Panama, were concluded in the early part of 1866, the “ Kaikoura ” being the
first steamer to leave Sydney on June 15th. The new Post Office was commenced
in this year, and none too soon, for the temporary building was neither safe,
convenient, nor healthy. On one occasion, in 1865, that of the destruction of
Frazer’s stores by fire, the temporary building was in great danger of being
destroyed.
From the very serious irregularities which had occurred in the performance
of the mail service via Galle, contracted for by the Peninsular and Oriental Com-
pany during the year 1865, and the early part of 1866, it was deemed expedient
to give the requisite notice to the Imperial Government of the intention of this
Colony to withdraw from that contract.
The sitting of the Postal Conference, held at Melbourne, at which the
Australasian Colonies were represented by delegates from New South Wales,
South Australia, Queensland, and New Zealand, in addition to the representatives
of the Colony of Victoria, extended over a period from the 4th March to the 21st
March, 1867, during which, the whole subject of steam postal communication was
most carefully and minutely considered.
The principal feature of 1867 was the passing of the New Postal Act, 31
Victoria, No. 4, which came into force on January Ist, 1868.
During the year the Peninsular and Oriental Company made great
exertions to render the service carried out by them more effective. In the
Postmaster-General’s Report for 1867 is published a “ Description of New South


Wales Postage Stamps; compiled by Thomas Richards, Esquire, Inspector of
Stamps/ As this is of much interest, though by no means free from error, as
we shall subsequently see, we reproduce it here :

It may not be out of place here to state that the Electric Telegraph
Department, hitherto under the Ministerial control of the Honorable the
Minister for Public Works, was transferred to the Postmaster-General on the
Ist July, 1867.
The Postal Act, which was passed towards the end of the year 1867,
enabled several important improvements in the postal service of the Colony to be


introduced during the year 1868. Among the advantages the following may he
mentioned, viz. : —The prepayment to destination of correspondence for the
Continent of Europe, without the necessity of such correspondence passing
through the United Kingdom ; the transmission of patterns and samples of
merchandise by the inland post; the reduction of the registration fee on letters
from 6d. to 4d.; the compulsory registration of letters containing coin or other
valuable articles; the transmission of insufficiently stamped ship letters,
provided they bore, when posted, not less than a single rate of postage ; and the
regulation of the Money Order System by Act of Parliament.
An account of the improved manner in which the Peninsular and Oriental
Company were performing their contract, and at the request of the Imperial
Government, it was agreed to allow the notice of discontinuance to remain in
abeyance.
The Panama service was discontinued at the end of 1868 in consequence
of the inability of the Company to complete its contract.
The number of letters posted in the Colony during 1868 amounted to
5,988,239; of newspapers, 3,145,977 ; and of parcels, 102,301. The number of
miles travelled by the mails was 2,777,197. The revenue amounted to £83,202
3s. Id., and the expenditure to £88,934 16s. 7d. On the 18th September, 1871, a
Postal Conference met at Melbourne. The result of the Conference was an agree-
ment for the establishment of a fortnightly mail service with London, despatched
alternately from Sydney, via Suez, and from Melbourne, via San Francisco. The
proceedings of the representatives of the Colony, however, did not receive the
approval of the Legislative Assembly, which refused to ratify this agreement.
Experimental services from Sydney to New Zealand and California, and
from Sydney to California, via Fiji, were established, but both were shortlived.
On September Ist, 1871, the system of Government Savings Banks under
the control of the Postmaster-General was established.
In February, 1873, a conference was held in Sydney for the purpose of
considering the question of steam postal communication. The result of the
conference was a difference of opinion between the colonies as regards the
Australian terminus of the mail service. On the 26th July, 1872, a resolution
was passed in the Legislative Assembly to the effect, that it was desirable that
arrangements should be made for the establishment of a monthly line of steamers
between Sydney and San Francisco, securing the delivery of mails at those ports


within 30 days, and between Sydney and Liverpool within 48 days. Tenders
were at once invited for this service; but of those sent in none were accepted, as
it was thought that a service might be contracted for, which would provide for
the mails being conveyed between this colony and Great Britain in a less period
than 48 days. It was then decided to hold a conference to take the whole
matter into consideration. This met in Sydney in the months of January and
February, 1873, but the result was unsatisfactory. In consequence of the action
of the Victorian Government in hurriedly making a contract with the Peninsular
and Oriental Company for a service between Melbourne and Point de Galle, Mr.
Parkes moved a series of resolutions on April 23rd, 1873, in the Legislative
Assembly, to the effect that a service be established between Sydney and San
Francisco, and that New Zealand be invited to join in the establishment of the
service. The Postmaster-General, Mr. Samuel, accompanied by Mr. James
Dalgarno, as Secretary, visited England, the United States of America, Honolulu,
Fiji, and New Zealand in connection with this service. On November 27th, after
much discussion, the formal contracts and bonds were signed in London, and on
December 20th, 1873, the first of the temporary steamships, the “ Macgregor,”
left Sydney for San Francisco, and reached that place in time to bring on the
mails of January 13th from London.
The opening of the new General Post Office, of which we give an illustra-
tion, was celebrated by a conversazione on the evening of the Ist September,
1874, when upwards of 1,500 persons were entertained by the Postmaster-General,
the Honorable (now Sir) Saul Samuel. The new building was subsequently thrown
open for a few days for the inspection of the general public, and on the 21st
September the secretary's, accountant’s, and cashier’s branches of the Post Office,
with the Money Order, Government Savings Bank, and Electric Telegraph
Departments, were removed from the temporary quarters into the new building.
The Newspaper Postage Abolition Act came into force on January Ist, 1874.
In 1874, the Queensland Government established a service via Torres
Straits, so that at that time New South Wales had the choice of three routes.
During nearly the whole of 1875, the service between Sydney and San Francisco
was performed by the Australasian Steam Navigation Company. In the meanwhile,
tenders for a permanent service were invited in England and the colonies; the
result was that the tender of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company was accepted.
In 1878, the number of persons employed in connection with the Postal
Department was 1,272. The number of letters posted was 17,013,/00; of
newspapers, 8,816,500; of parcels, 439,000; of post cards, 123,720,


The revenue for 1878 amounted to £155,621 19s. 6d., and the expenditure
to £165,477 17s. 6d. The number of miles travelled by the mails was 4,389,925.
In the year 1879, a special description of postage stamps was introduced
for the use of the various Government departments. These stamps are
distinguished by the letters u O.S ” printed thereon in black, and are only
available for official correspondence; and letters having postage stamps of this
character affixed thereto are liable to be intercepted by the Post Office, unless
the envelopes bear the endorsement “ 0.H.M.5.”, with the name of the department
from which they are sent in a corner, or, in the case of letters addressed to a
department, the name of the sender written in the corner. Under no pretext
whatever are these stamps purchased by, or exchanged for, other postage stamps
at the Post Office.
The mail service performed by the Peninsular and Oriental Company
between Melbourne and Point de Galle was increased in 1880 to a fortnightly
one. The completion of the extension of the railway to Albury enabled the
correspondence despatched from Melbourne at 6'lo a.m. to be delivered into the
General Post Office, Sydney, at 7*lo a.m. the next day. In the month of May,
1883, a Postal Conference of Ministerial representatives from the colonies of
New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria, was
held at Sydney, at which several resolutions on important matters connected
with the Postal and Telegraphic Departments were carried; and in November
following advantage was taken of the meeting of delegates at the Intercolonial
Convention to refer to the question of telegraphic communication with the mother
country.
In August, 1883, a contract was concluded with the Orient Steam
Navigation Company (Limited) for the conveyance of mails, fortnightly, between
this Colony and the mother country, to alternate with that of the Peninsular and
Oriental Company, thus securing a regular weekly mail to and from England.
An important feature in the contract made with the Orient Steam Navigation
Company was that the Government paid no subsidy for mail matter conveyed,
a fair payment per lb. being made to the Company, thus showing that the system
of paying large subsidies for the conveyance of ocean-going mails will soon be a
thing of the past.
In the month of November, 1886, a Conference was held at Melbourne,
the principal object of which was the discussion of a Federal Ocean Mail Service.
The Parcel Post System was inaugurated in this year between this Colony and
the United Kingdom.


In January, 1888, a Conference was field in Sydney, at which various
important matters were considered. One result was that a fresh contract was
entered into with the Peninsular and Oriental and the Orient Companies for a
period of seven years.
In view of the year 1888 being the one hundredth anniversary of the
foundation of the Colony, it was determined to commemorate the event by the
issue of eight new postage stamps. A full description of this issue will be given
in another place.
The establishment of a Postal Card System between New South Wales
and the United Kingdom, on the Ist January, 1890, necessitated the issue of
suitable cards. A post card of the value of 2d. was therefore issued for use by
the contract packets of the Peninsular and Oriental and the Orient Steam
Navigation Companies only, by what is termed the long sea route, i.e., conveyed
all the way from Australia, hy sea, to England. A post card, of the value of Bd.,
was also issued for use between this Colony and the United Kingdom, overland,
via Italy.
As the year 1888 happened to be the fiftieth since the introduction of
postage stamps in the Colony of New South Wales, the necessity that arose for
the issue of special post cards was availed of, to commemorate this jubilee event
by including in the design of these post cards a reference to the occasion.
Perhaps in no instance has the progress of the Colony been so marked as
in the development and extension of its postal system. This is well illustrated
by Table A, which has been drawn up for the purpose of illustrating the pro-
gressive increase of the Postal Department from 1828 to 1888. In a lesser way,
Table B, giving the total number of stamps issued by the Post Office from 1872
up to the present, shows the same thing. The Post Office has been described as
“ one of the most effective instruments of civilisation, to be ranked with the art
of printing and the mariner’s compass.” When we know that during the year
1888, 31,722,000 newspapers were delivered by the Post Office, we can well
understand how the power of the press would be crippled unless its influence
were distributed by means of an efficient postal delivery.
Looking at the table again, who would have ventured to say fifty years
ago that so marvellous an increase would take place ? And what person will be
bold enough to predict the position of Australia in another fifty years, when
Federation will no longer be “ in the air,” but an accomplished fact I _

HISTORY OF THE ISSUE OF POSTAGE STAMPS
IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
I.—THE STAMPED COVERS OF 1838.
ififl N May 29 th, 1869, Sir Daniel Cooper read a paper before the Philatelic
Society of London, in which he demonstrated the existence of ff stamped
covers '” wll ich had been in use in Sydney at a comparatively early date.
Much doubt existed as to the exact period at which these covers were
issued. In a recent work, issued by the above-fiientioned society,
occurs the following passage :
It would certainly be a curious fact if a Town like Sydney, primitive as it was in
those days, had adopted stamped letter-sheets about two years before the introduction of
postage stamps in England.
In the following pages we shall show that, however curious it may appear,
still, it is a fact that New South Wales was the first country in the world to adopt
the system of prepaying letters by means of postage stamps.
In 1837 Mr. Rowland Hill published his first pamphlet, showing that the
then average cost of conveying a letter or newspaper in Great Britain, including
the cost of collecting the tax thereon, was about About the same time
the Committee of Post Office Inquiry, composed of Lord Duncannon, Mr. H.
Labouchere, and Lord Seymour, was holding its sittings for the purpose of
enquiring into the condition of the “ Two-penny Post.” Mr. Hill was called upon
to give evidence before this Committee, and, as showing that his opinions had
some weight with the Commissioners, they recommended
the adoption of a uniform letter rate of Id. for letters under 1 oz. in weight throughout
the metropolitan district of 12 miles round the General Post Office, which they considered
might with advantage be increased to 15 ; but they made it the condition of the enjoy-
ment of this reduction in the rate, that letters not exceeding 1 oz. in weight should be
enclosed in stamped covers or envelopes of Id.; and exceeding that weight and up to 6 oz.,
in similar covers or envelopes of 2d.
This report, the ninth, was dated July 7th, 1837. Let us now see what influence
this report had on the issue of the stamped covers in Sydney. Sir George Gipps
assumed the Governorship of the Colony on February 24th, 1838, and probably
D


brought with him a copy of the Report of the Commissioners. At any rate,
Rowland Hill’s pamphlet was certainly in the hands of the Postmaster-General of
New South Wales very shortly after, as the following letter will show :
General Post Office,
Sir, Sydney, 7 September, 1838.
Having attentively perused the suggestions of Mr. Rowland Hill on the
subject of introducing stamped covers as a means of simplifying and effecting a reduction
in postage, I have endeavoured to perfect an envelope which I do myself the honor to
submit for the inspection of His Excellency the Governor.
In accordance with the plan promulgated by that gentleman, I propose that half-
sheets of paper, stamped as per specimen, be supplied to the public at such a price as to
include the postage ; and that letters so enveloped shall be received and passed through
this office for distribution, within the town delivery of Sydney, free of any other charge,
being first stamped with the Post Office stamp of the day.
By this experiment I anticipate a large increase to the communication throughout
the town, and that I shall shortly see invitations, bills, notices, and all mercantile
communications transmitted under cover of such envelopes, which will add materially to
the revenue, by inducing communications of that nature to be sent through the Post
Office, while the labour can be scarcely felt by the letter-carriers, as they will only have
to drop them in rapid succession as they proceed along, the chief delay and difficulty in
delivery being the waiting for and obtaining change.
Should His Excellency be pleased to approve of the experiment being made, if not
found to answer, it could be withdrawn at any moment, as I do not mean to interfere
with or disturb the present two-penny or other delivery now established, until it could
be ascertained from experience whether subsequent improvements may render the system
available for more general purposes.
To commence operations it only requires the Governor’s sanction, for by the 3rd
section of the Post Office Act, William IV, No. 34, it is competent for His Excellency
to alter, revoke, or vary the rules and regulations, as well as the postage, provided there
be no increase made on the postage set forth in the schedule referred to.
The rate to be fixed forms some matter of consideration ; but in my humble
opinion a penny will compensate for the paper and delivery, while so low a rate will
induce an influx of letters that will ultimately replenish the revenue, and be esteemed as
a boon to the public from the hands of His Excellency.
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
JAS. RAYMOND.
The Honorable the Colonial Secretary.
Let the experiment be tried; but the price must be fixed at l|d. the single cover,
or Is. 3d. per dozen.—G.G., Oct. 13, 1838.
From this letter it appears that Mr. Raymond recommended the charge
of Id. as sufficient to compensate for the paper and delivery, relying upon
an influx of letters that will ultimately replenish the revenue, and be esteemed a boon to
the public from the hands of His Excellency.


The Governor’s minute sanctioned the experiment; but fixed the price at
a somewhat higher rate. The following is the Colonial Secretary’s reply, based
upon the minute :
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sydney, 15 October, 1838.
In reply to your letter of the 7th ultimo, proposing that stamped half-sheets
of paper should be supplied to the public for letter covers, at such a price as would
include the postage, and that letters so enveloped should be received and passed through
your office for distribution within the town delivery of Sydney free of any other charge,
being first stamped with the Post Office stamp of the day, I am directed by the Governor
to inform you that His Excellency approves of your trying the experiment; but that the
price of the covers must be fixed at l|d. the single cover, or Is. 3d. per dozen.
I have, &c.,
E. DEAS-THOMSON.
PS. You will be pleased to submit for approval a notice of this arrangement for
the information of the public.
James Raymond, Esq., Postmaster-General.
In the postscript instructions are given to submit a notice of this arrange-
ment for the information of the public. This was done on November 3rd, 1838,
and approved of, as the following letter will show :—■
General Post Office,
Sydney, 3 November, 1838.
In accordance with the desire contained in your letter of the 15th ultimo, I
do myself the honor to submit for your approval a notification of the stamped covers
being ready for issue, to be inserted in the 6 overnment Gazette.
In my opinion it would be desirable that this notification and the Act as amended
in the last session of the Council be published at the same time.
I have, &c.,
JAS. RAYMOND.
The notice appeared in the Government Gazette of November 14th, 1838,
and was as follows General Post Office,
Sydney, 1 November, 1838.
Whereas it has been considered that by transmitting letters, invitations, notices, bills,
&c., under stamped or Post Office covers, the delivery thereof would be much expedited by
avoiding the delay consequent on the letter-carriers awaiting payment, His Excellency
the Governor, with this view, and in order to effect a reduction of postage on such
communications intended for delivery within the limits of the town of Sydney, has been
pleased to sanction their transmission under envelopes, which may be obtained at the
General Post Office on payment of Is. 3d. per dozen, including all charges for paper and
delivery. This arrangement is not intended to suspend or interfere with the present
two-penny post delivery, which will proceed in all respects as heretofore.
JAMES RAYMOND,
Postmaster-General.
From Mr. Raymond’s letter of September 7th, it is evident that, as he
submitted a specimen, the die must have been engraved at that time. It was
engraved by W. Wilson, an engraver of some note at that time, and who did a
good deal of work for the Government,


The question now arises, how were these covers received by the public ?
The following press notices will give the answer. From the Sydney Gazette for
November 24th, 1838, I take the following
The Post Office.—Mr. Raymond, the Postmaster-General, has forwarded us a few
specimens of the stamped letter covers which, it is directed by a notice in the last
Government Gazette , shall pass free through the Post Office. The object of this arrange-
ment is to expedite the delivery within the limits of the town of Sydney, ot letters,
invitations, notices, &c., which will be effected by doing away with the delay consequent
on the letter-carriers being compelled to wait for payment at every house. A reduction
will also be effected in the amount of postage, the charge for the stamped paper, which
can be obtained at the Post Office, being only Is. 3d. per dozen sheets. The principle is
the same as that under the consideration of the British Parliament at present, only
more limited in extent. The Parliamentary Committee have recommended that letters
having on two penny stamps, shall pass free from and to all parts of the British dominions.
The last two paragraphs clearly show that the Report of the Committee
was in the hands of the Postal authorities at this time, and that they had
sufficient foresight to adopt the recommendation which had been made to the
British Parliament. One other notice will suffice. It appeared in the Australian
for November 29th, 1838 :
We have received a dozen of envelopes for the two-penny post delivery fiom the
Postmaster, which are intended to try the effect of the stamp system introduced in
England to this Colony. We are of opinion that the system will act well in this Colony; and
if it is carried into general effect will be much for the advantage of the mercantile world in
the Colony. We should conceive that a general operation of the system would be a very
<rreat advantage; but we should wish that the system should be put generally into operation
otherwise the system will act partially. • If made a general system, without doubt it would
have a capital effect, and prevent the general post-payer from the impost of paying a regular
tax upon communications which frequently are more expensive than ad\ antageous.
With such an expression of opinion as this, one is rather surprised to
find that these covers were but little used. Yet such was the fact, and for the
purpose of again calling attention to them, the following notice was inserted in
the Government Gazette of January 14th, 1841 :
General Post Office,
„ , ~ Sydney, 4 January, 1841.
Stamped Covers.
By a notice from this office, dated Ist November, 1838, it was signified that stamped
covers might from that time be obtained at a charge of Is. 3d. per dozen, in which to
envelope fetters, which, being posted in Sydney, would exempt such letters from any
further charge to the full limit of the two-penny post delivery.
His Excellency the Governor now, with a view still further to extend this accom-
modation, has been pleased to sanction a reduction of the charge to Is. per dozen, or Bs.
per hundred, and stamps or covers may in future be obtained at this rate in any number
JAMES RAYMOND,
upon application at this office.
Postmaster-General.
Unfortunately, the records bearing on this last notice are not to be found
at present.


Now, let us see for a moment what these covers were like. They were
simply half-sheets of paper, foolscap size, on the centre of the upper part of
which was embossed, in relief only, without colour, and before the paper was
folded, the stamp in question. This stamp is 29 millimetres in diameter.
Between two concentric circles are the w r ords, above, “ General Post Office,”
below, “New South Wales.” In the centre of these circles
is the Royal coat of arms and supporters, with the motto
“ Dieu et mon droit,” under which is “ Sydney.” The
Royal coat of arms is not that of Victoria, but of William
IV, and contains the Hanoverian coat of arms, surmounted
by the Hanoverian Crown, in the centre of the Royal coat of
arms.
In addition to these covers, envelopes exist. The following descriptions
are taken from a paper of mine in the Philatelic Record, for March, 1888 :
The first is on white laid paper ; it measures 133 millimetres by 75 millimetres.
The date stamp is in red (which colour was used at that time for free or franked letters),
and bears the date June 21st, 1848. The letter is’ addressed to a well-known Sydney
resident. In the lower left-hand corner is the name “G. H. Fitzroy ” (son of the
Governor). On the back is a large wax seal, bearing a crown in the centre, surrounded
by the words, “ Private Secretary, New South Wales.” The stamp is embossed through
ail the folds of the paper, therein differing from the wrappers, which were only embossed
through one thickness , but resembling the reprints, which may always be recognised by
being embossed through three thicknesses of the paper. The flaps are cut in a similar
manner to those now in use.
The other specimen is on white wove paper; it measures 120 millimetres by 69
millimetres ; it is addressed to one of the masters of the old Sydney College. The date
stamp is in black, and bears the date May 20th, 1850. The stamp is again embossed
through all the folds of the paper. The flaps in this are cut in a concave form, differing
from those of any envelopes now in use.
From this description it is evident that these .envelopes were embossed
after the envelopes were made, and on examining the specimens this is found to
be the case, for in the second one, mentioned above, the circle is not complete,
and on opening up the flap the embossing shows a figure of 8, or rather where
the two circles join (for the stamp has been impressed right up to the upper
margin of the envelope), the point of their intersection is wanting, showing very
clearly that the embossing was done after the envelope was made.
From the earlier Gazette notice it will be seen that the phraseology used
does not preclude the possibility of envelopes having been used as well as covers.
It states :
His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to sanction their
transmission under envelopes.


Again, in the later notice of January 4th, 1841, it states :
Stamps or covers may in future be obtained, etc.
From this it is clear that the public might have these stamps embossed
on their own paper or envelopes. This theory has been most unexpectedly borne
out by R. A. Hunt, Esq., who entered the Post Office in 1833, and held office in
it for very many years, and, although, now 85 years of age, he has a most vivid
recollection of all that transpired in the earlier days. He states that the public
were in the habit of handing in packets of envelopes to the clerk at the window
to have the stamp impressed on them; and that this was done even after the
issue of adhesives in 1850, as is borne out by the date on the second envelope
before described. The charge was Is. Bd, for twenty-five impressions. From
this, it is evident, that the embossed stamp may be found on all kinds of paper.
Other specimens are known on blue wove and yellow wove paper. These
embossed stamps were continued in use by the Postage Act of 1849. In clause
12 we find it stated :
That all letters or packets, if enclosed in stamped covers, or having a stamp or
stamps affixed thereto or impressed thereon ; and all bankers’ parcels ... if enclosed
in stamped covers, or having a stamp or stamps affixed thereto or impressed thereon,
shall pass free of postage, the stamps in every such case being affixed or appearing on the
outside, and being of the value or amount of the rates of postage to which such letter or
other packet or packets would be liable under this Act, and provided that the stamp shall
not have been used before.
The Postage Act of 1851 continues their use in these words:—
That the stamps upon all letters and packets shad be affixed or impressed upon
the outside thereof, and above the address written thereon.
This is the last notice of them that appears in any Act of Parliament or
Gazette. The following note by the editor of the Philatelic Record is of
interest:—
We may mention that the statement in the work of the society (The Postage
Stamps of Oceania), made,, we suppose, on the authority of a notice in The Stamp
Collector s Magazine, of March, 1870, that the die used for striking the embossed stamp
of 1838 “had been chiselled out, so that reprints were impossible,” is a myth. The die
is uninjured, and is now in the Government Printing Office, being still used for striking
off reprints. We are told that some of these were sold in England in 1870 as originals,
at high prices, as we ourselves remember with a sigh. The author of the paper in The
Stamp Collector s Magazine evidently made a mistake. The chiselling was not that of the
die, but of the purchasers of these rarities, who doubtless were led to believe that they
would never be favoured with another chance of possessing them. How often we have
heard the same tale !


In looking over the records in the Colonial Secretary’s Office, the following
extract from an article in the Christian Standard, on Postage Reform, was found.
It simply bears the date, 1849 :
It may not be generally known that covers can be got at the Post Office for Id.,
that will carry a certain weight through the city—even this convenience is not always to
be had. An acquaintance of ours called last week for 100 covers, and was told that the
supply was then exhausted, but would in all likelihood be made up on the following day.
Our friend proceeded to all the stationers in town, and found a very small supply in one
stationer s shop. They remarked they had nothing but trouble by retailing these covers,
and would not continue the practice any longer; so that there is no other guarantee for this
convenience than the pleasure or caprice of Post Office people. Surely supplies of these
covers ought to be procured in all quarters of the city; and without any fail, on any day,
at the head office. Parties would be glad to sell these covers if allowed a reasonable per-
centage for their trouble. There is a solitary receiving office in the city, but where ?
In Ehzabeth-street, fronting Hyde Park, and quite contiguous to the head office itself
It this one receiving house were at Miller’s Point, Balmain, North Shore, Surry Hills, or
Paddington even, it might be of some little service.
Let us now look at Mr. Raymond’s evidence before the Select Committee
on the 1 ostage Rill in 1849. On August 18th he gave the following evidence; the
Chairman, E. Deas-Thomson, Esq., Colonial Secretary, is examining, and those
present were Daniel Cooper, Esq., Charles Cowper, Esq., and Henry Moore, Esq.;
76. Could you not carry out the others ?—I should say we might. At the present
moment we do make a great many stamps for the town delivery.
77. In what way would you propose, after the stamps have passed through the
Post Office, to mark them, so as to prevent their being used again ?—There is a sort of
die used m the English Post Offices, which is put across them and disfigures them.
78. Would you propose that these stamps should be sold to stationers and also to
country postmasters, that they might be purchased for individuals for use as they might
be required ?—Yes ; that is the best way of disposing of them.
79. They might be sold at a small percentage discount in order to leave a profit
to the ultimate vendors ?—I charge Bs. a hundred for the present stamps, so that the
vendor has 4d. profit on a hundred.
80. Do you find that that is a sufficient inducement to parties to deal in stamps
of that kind?—l have experienced some difficulty in inducing persons to use these
envelopes ; for although the charge for postage when the envelope is not used is 2d.
and the envelope costs only a penny, they have been very little used; of late, however
they have been much more generally used.
81. By Mr. Cooper: If there were a more frequent delivery, would there not be a
great increase in the use of them ? —I adopted three deliveries ; one at 9 o’clock one at
2, and one at 4 ; but I found the 4 o’clock delivery of no use, the principal merchants
being away, the offices locked, and nobody to take the letters.
He was farther examined on August 22nd, when the following information
was elicited :
36. By Mr. Moore: The charge for letters delivered in Sydney is now Id. ?
*—lt is when stamps are used.
37. Without stamps what is it?—2d.


38. Are those stamps sold at any place besides the Post Office ?—They were
supplied to several stationers, but they found they could not sell them.
39. Did they return those stamps to you 1 —No; they paid for them as they got
them.
In “ Oceania ” the author of the first paper on the “ Local Stamped Letter-
sheet for the Town of Sydney ” has, unfortunately, in the answer to question 76,
added the little word “ not,” which entirely alters the sense. The Postmaster-
General stated:—
At the present moment we do make a great many stamps for the town delivery.
In this he was correct, for in a return of the number of letters circulating
in New South Wales during the year 1848, will be found the following interesting
information ;
Stamped covers, 15,225 ; amount of postage, <£63 Bs. 9d.
Our only wonder is, where have they all gone to ?
“The fact remains,” according to the Philatelic Pecord, “ that'as early as the Ist
November, 1838, the prepayment of postage by the sender by means of stamped covers
was in existence (in Sydney), although it was not adopted in England till February,
1840, and render similar conditions.”

Question put and passed.
Such is the record of the appointment of the Select Committee on the
Postage Bill of 1849. Their report was laid on the table of the House on
September 12th, 1849. As some of their recommendations are of interest we
will reproduce the most important: —
As the measure introduced by the Government recognises the expediency of
adopting an uniform rate of postage, the first question which engaged the attention
of your Committee was the particular rate which should be adopted in this Colony,
having a due regard, on the one hand, to the wants of the public, and on the other hand,
to the exigencies of the revenue ; it appearing to your Committee that the Postal
Department should be made to pay its own expenses, or, in other words, that the rate
should be so fixed as that the expenditure of the Post Office should be ultimately
covered by the revenue to be derived from postage.
2. The principle of an uniform rate appears inseparable if not deducible, from
another principle, namely, that of prepayment. To adopt the language of the author of
Postal Reform in Great Britain —
The essential elements of such a plan are, first, a very low rate of postage, to neutralise the
objections on the part of the public to its being demanded in advance; and secondly, an uniform rate of
postage to simplify the mode of accounting for its receipt.
3. It may not be inappropriate here to glance at the mode in which the uniform
penny rate was arrived at in Great Britain. From a statement contained in Mr.
Rowland Hill’s first pamphlet (1837), it appears that the then average cost of conveying
a letter or newspaper in Great Britain, including the cost of collecting the tax thereon,
was about lid. But it was shewn that the Post Office Revenue was burdened with
1?


many heavy charges which in fairness ought not to enter into the calculation. Disre-
garding these extraneous charges, the results at which Mr. Hill arrived are thus shewn
(page 16): —
It appears then that the cost of mere transit incurred upon a letter from London to Edinburgh,
a distance of four hundred miles, is not more than one thirty-sixth part of a penny. If therefore the
proper charge (exclusive of tax) upon a letter received and delivered in London itself, were two-pence,
then the proper charge (exclusive of tax) upon a letter received in London, but delivered in Edinburgh,
would be two-pence plus one thirty-sixth part of a penny. Now, as the letters taken from London to
Edinburgh are undoubtedly carried much more than an average distance, it follows, that when the
charge for the receipt and delivery of the letter is determined, an additional charge of one thirty-sixth
part of a penny would amply repay the expense of transit. If therefore the charge for postage he made
proportionate to the whole expense incurred in the receipt, transit, and delivery of the letter, and in the
collection of its postage, it must he made uniformly the same from every Post Town to every other Post
Town in the United Kingdom, unless it can be shewn how we are to collect so small a sum as the thirty -
sixtli part of a penny.
4. Your Committee were desirous of following the course here marked out, as
closely as the different circumstances of the Colony would permit. According to a
Return laid before your Committee by the Postmaster-General, it appears that, assuming
for the purpose of this calculation that letters of every kind and also newspapers pay
postage, the present average rate of postage is 2-38 pence, whilst the entire average cost
per letter is 2-52 pence, of which 1-57 of a penny, or more than three-fifths, represents
the average cost of conveyance, and 0-95 of a penny, or less than two-fifths the cost of
management, or, in other words, of the receipt, delivery, and collection of the postage.
Clause 6 recommends that the uniform inland rate of postage in the Colony
be fixed at 2d. for letters not exceeding oz. in weight, to be doubled in case of
non-prepayment.
Clause 7 proposes a moderate charge on newspapers.
Clause 15 recommends the introduction of the system of Post Office stamps
then in use in England, and goes on to say:—
With this view your Committee recommend the introduction of the system of Post
Office stamps now in use in England. The necessary dies can, your Committee have
ascertained, be prepared in the Colony at a moderate cost. The dies, when so prepared,
should be placed in the custody of the Postmaster-General, who should keep a strict
account of the stamps struck off, and render periodical returns thereof, and of the issues,
to the Government.
16. Your Committee attach the utmost impoi’tance to the successful introduction
of stamps, without which the system of a low uniform rate can scarcely be said to have
a fair trial. For the same reason, your Committee recommend that facilities for
increased correspondence should be given by the establishment of Post Offices in all the
suburbs of the city, and of a number of receiving-houses in convenient parts within the
city. These receiving-houses should not, as at present, be confined to the receipt of
unpaid letters only, but should be open for the receipt of all letters and packets of every
kind transmissible by post, whether unpaid or prepaid by stamp or otherwise. In order
to induce respectable shopkeepers and others to undertake the duties attaching to these
receiving-houses, it will, of course, be necessary to allow them some adequate remuneration.
The Report concludes as follows :
21. Although your Committee have not been able to suggest a strict adherence in
all respects to the postal operations of Great Britain, they yet conceive that, bearing in
mind the present circumstances of the Colony, the reform involved in the foregoing


recommendations is so considerable as to justify the adoption, in a qualified sense, of the
language used by Mr. Rowland Hill, when, twelve years ago, he so happily conceived the
idea, since effectuated, of postal reform in England ;
.. . object is not to increase the political power of this or that party, but to benefit all sects in
politics and religion, and all classes from the highest to the lowest. To the rich as to the less wealthy,
!t will be acceptable, from the increased facilities it will afford for their correspondence. To the
middle classes it will bring relief from oppressive and irritating demands which they pay grudgingly.
. • j • • . . And to the poor it will
atlord the means of communication with their distant friends and relatives, from which they are at
present debarred. It will give increased energy to trade ; it will remove innumerable temptations to
fraud, and it will be an important step in education ; the more important, perhaps, because it calls on
(joveinment for no factitious aid—for nothing in the shape of encouragement, still less of compulsion—
but merely for the removal of an obstacle created by the law to that spontaneous education which
happily is extending through the country, and, which even the opponents of a National system will
agree, ought to be unobstructed in its progress.
Some portions of the evidence are of much interest, and they are, there-
fore, reproduced here :
60. By the Chairman : Have you considered the practicability of introducing the
system of stamps for prepayment into this Colony I —When the subject was first brought
under my notice I thought we could only obtain stamps by sending to the Stamp Office
in England for them, but by this means the whole of our revenue would have been
absorbed ; to avoid the evil, I propose that we should have a stamp prepared here, which
should be kept in a room in the Post Office, where any quantity might be struck off.
66. You are in favour of stamps !-Yes,
67. You think you could manage it by your own department, if the proper dies
were made I —Yes.
68. Have you made any inqniry as to whether the proper dies could be made in
the Colony I —l have.
69* Will you state the result of that inquiry I —One of the engravers has sent me
a tender offering to put the whole thing in working order for £36. ( The witness handed
in the same , vide Appendix E.)
'O. Is that for one description of stamp only I —For three different descriptions ;
the press is the expensive part of it; the stamps are fixed into the press.
71, That would include engraving the stamps ?—Yes.
12. Have you satisfied yourself that these are stamps which could not easily be
imitated to facilitate forgery ?—.By having them under our own lock, no one could furnish
them without going to the expense of, say, £25; and it would be very little worth a
man s while to go to that expense for a thing which could only last for a few days, as it
must soon be discovered.
73. By Mr. Cooper: By a galvanic battery might it not be done at a small expense ?
I do not think the inducement would be sufficiently great to a person to forge the stamps.
The following is Clayton’s tender [Appendix E) mentioned above :
Castlereagh-street, Sydney,
Gentlemen, 24 August, 1849.
I beg leave most respectfully to state, that I am prepared to furnish you
with Press, Dies, and Plates, for the sum of (£36) thirty-six pounds, covering the whole
expense necessary for the full completion of the work you require for the General Post
Office Establishment. ...... , „
W ith the most profound respect,
I beg to subscribe myself, gentlemen,
Your most obedient servant,
ROBT. CLAYTON.


Melbourne appears to have been more highly favoured than Sydney :
40. What is the charge for letters posted and delivered in the City of Melbourne ?
—One penny whether prepaid or not.
41. Will you account for the difference between the charge of one penny in
Melbourne, and two-pence in Sydney I—At the time the Act of Council was passed, there
was no Post Office established in Melbourne, and that is treated as being a town in the
country, while Sydney is, of course, specially provided for in the Act.
42. In Melbourne and Geelong there is no penalty for non-prepayment; but there
is in Sydney ?—There is.
Robert Clayton’s evidence is so interesting that it is reproduced in
extenso :
Mr. Robert Clayton called in and examined ;
1. How are you engaged in Sydney ? —ln engraving and printing.
2. Did you follow the same calling in England ? —Yes.
3. The Committee are desirous of introducing a system of stamps for the
prepayment of postage, similar to that which obtains in England ; are you prepared to
offer any suggestions with reference to that subject ?—I am.
4. Do you consider you could produce such a stamp as it would be impossible to
imitate ?—I would not say that it would be impossible to imitate it, but I would produce
one similar to that used at the Post Office in England.
5. Are you acquainted witli the adhesive mixture which is necessary to fix it
upon letters'?—Yes, perfectly ; for I have provided it in the Stamp Office in the City of
Dublin.
6. Could a stamp of that nature be easily imitated ( a Post Office adhesive stamp
heincj handed to the witness)l —lt could, I think ; I have examined it with a microscope
and found that it is in regular waves, with a white spot between the ink.
7. Is the paper of any peculiar texture, or has it any peculiar mark ?—I am not
aware.
8. Can you produce the particular ink so as to give the red color which that
stamp possesses ?—I cannot say; but I can produce inks of almost every color, and have
done ; the ink used for these stamps may be peculiar ; I know nothing of it.
9. What would be the cost of a stamp of that kind ?—There should be several
before you could possibly carry on an establishment; several on a plate ; I am, however,
acquainted with a plan by which several thousand impressions might be taken from
one die.
10. Each die would then produce the same impression as the original ? —Yes ; it
must necessarily be the same.
11. Do you consider that you could make a die that would be difficult to imitate?
—I do ; and I have done so, in the Stamp Offices in Dublin and London.
12. Have you engraved dies for the Stamp Offices of London and Dublin? —In
Dublin.
13. Have you any specimens of your engraving which you could exhibit to the
Committee ? —I have not with me, but will forward them to the Committee; I am,
however, in possession of a system which would be of the greatest importance.
14. Will you explain that system so far as you are willing to disclose it ? —The
plan I would suggest is to take an indefinite number of copies from the original die ; this
would obviate the necessity of touching up the plate, which cannot be done without
injury.


15. Would that enable you to make an engraving of an elaborate character ?
xes; but there never was an engraving produced which could not be imitated.
IG. Can you inform the Committee of the probable expense of carrying out your
pan ; supposing stamps of three different descriptions should be required ; what would
be the probable cost of those stamps per thousand, for any given number ?—About Is.
a thousand on my system.
17. By Mr. Moore: What would be the first cost of the die ?—About £5.
18. By Mr. Hamilton: For each die?—Yes ; I could do it in perfection for that
sum.
19. That die can be multiplied indefinitely?—'Yes; hundreds of thousands may
be produced.
20. By the Chairman: Could you also make a stamp of that description (handing
one of the Post Office stamps printed in blue to the witness) ?—This is similar to the one
pieviously handed to me ; but printed in another color.
21. Would there be any difficulty in sticking those stamps on sheets of paper and
envelopes if it were thought necessary ?—None whatever.
22. Then, they might be applied in all the ways in which they are used, for the
puiposes of prepayment of postage in England ?—Unquestionably.
23. Are you acquainted with the indelible ink which is used for stamping the
letters, in their passage through the Post Office ? —Perfectly.
24. Is it a description of ink that cannot be removed with acids, or in any way so
as to remove the impression ?—I can produce an ink that cannot be removed by acids.
U P erce^ve that there are certain letters in the corners of the stamps, as
A. C., A. 8., and so on ; would there be any difficulty in producing a plate of that kind ?
—I do not see any.
26. What would be the additional expense of producing such a plate, seeing that
you could not multiply the plate in such a way as to indicate each letter, because the
plan you propose would make each plate identical with the original ?—I would leave a
square recess in the die, into which the various letters might be dropped.
2 1 . That would not be the cause of any additional expense in the formation of the
die ?—No. r
~ . y ou cons hler that stamps of this nature printed in colors are more or less
easily imitated than those that are cut in relief ?—I think those cut in relief are objection-
able, as being more easily imitated than those printed in colors.
29. Do you think you could make a stamp that would be as difficult to imitate as
that of the English Post Office ?—Certainly • and I could do more than that; I could
print them in five colors, a red line crossing a blue one, or a black one crossing a white
or a red.
30. Would you be willing if the Government were to enter into a contract with
you to give security that you would not use the dies in your possession for ony other
purpose than for producing stamps that would be for the purposes of the Government ?
I would.
31. Will you forward to the Committee some specimens of your engraving ?—Yes.
32. Would the expense of producing stamps be increased by printing them in
party colors in the way you have mentioned ?—About 6d. a thousand additional.
33. Whether they were two colors or more ?—For every additional color they
would cost an additional 6d. per thousand.
34. In the estimate you have mentioned do you include the expense of paper ?
No; the paper is found by the Post Office at home ; perhaps the price might be less if it
were entirely under my direction and superintendence.
35. Does your estimate include the expense of gumming the backs of the stamps ?
No; there would be an additional expense for that of about Id. per sheet, demy folio.

This concludes the important part of the evidence relating to the intro-
duction of postage stamps. On Plate YII we have reproduced some of ClaytoiPs
specimens of engraving, as mentioned in questions 13 and 31, figs, h, e, engraved
by him. Figs, h, i, j are from proofs in the collection of the General Post Office,
but they have been printed from a lithographic transfer of the original plate.
The Bill, with certain slight amendments, was passed, and as we have
given a short resume of it in the History of the Post Office, it is unnecessary to
repeat it here.
In the Government Gazette of December 25th, 1849, the following notice
appeared:—
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sydney, 22 December, 1849.

It will be observed that all Letters not prepaid will be liable to double Postage,
but in order to facilitate the prepayment, Stamps have been prepared, and will be sold to
the Public at every Post Office, Sub-Office, and Receiving-house at the following rates ;
Letters having Stamps equal to the Rates of Postage, pass free of all other
Postage, but where the value of the Stamps is less than the Postage, they will be charged
double the amount of such difference. The Stamps are to be placed on the front of the
Letter above the Superscription.
Letters must be posted half an hour previous to the time fixed for despatch of the
Mails ; but late Letters will be received to within a quarter of an hour upon payment of
a Fee of 6d. each Letter.
Letters will be registered and receipts given upon payment of a fee of 6d. each
Letter. The Post Office will not be responsible for such Letters, but every caution shall
be adopted to prevent loss by entering them upon the Letter Bills and obtaining receipts
for them upon delivery. Parties are however advised to cut Notes or Drafts in halves
and send them by different Posts.
Letter-carriers will deliver within the limits of Sydney twice in each day,
starting from the General Post Office at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m., and any Letter-carrier
delivering Letters in the street, or loitering whilst on delivery, will be dismissed.
Private Letter Boxes will be provided for Merchants and others, and their
Letters delivered at a separate window upon payment of one guinea per annum.
The General Post Office will be open to the Public from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., except
for half an hour for the despatch of the Country Mails, namely, from half-past 4 to 5 p.m.
No Hackney Carriage shall stand, or ply for hire, nor shall any Hawker, News-
vender, or idle or disorderly person stop or loiter opposite the General Post Office, under
a penalty of £5.
The Country Offices will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., except where Mails arrive
at a later hour; in which case the Office will be open for half an hour after such arrival,
but not later than 8 p.m.


Receiving-houses will be established at the following places within the limits of
the City of Sydney, for all Stamped and unpaid Letters and Newspapers. These Offices
will be visited at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., and all Letters and Newspapers posted there will be
brought to the General Post Office for distribution, viz. :
At Mr. Alder’s, Parramatta-street, nearly opposite to the road leading to
Redfern.
At Mr. Row’s, corner of Liverpool and Pitt Streets.
At Mr, Taylor’s, South Head Road, nearly opposite to Darlinghurst Court-house.
At Mr. Read’s, Toy Bazaar, Elizabeth-street.
At Mr. F, Mitchell’s, opposite the Queen’s Wharf; and
At Mr. Vaughan’s Miller’s Point.
Sub-Offices will also be established at the following Suburbs, where all Letters and
Newspapers will be forwarded for distribution, and at which Offices all Stamped and
Unpaid Letters can be posted, but no Newspaper or Letter can be prepaid in money, viz. :
Balmain, St. Leonards, Paddington, Newtown, and Longbottom.
This now brings us to the stamps themselves, and here let me state, once
and for all, that my intention is simply to deal with the history of the issue of
the stamps, and such other matters as are not generally known.
All details, as to errors in engraving, varieties of paper used, &c., can be
found in other works.

II. —THE SYDNEY VIEWS.
dealing witli these interesting stamps, it is impossible to follow strictly
any set plan.
From the Gazette notice of December 22nd, 1849, it appears that
they were first used on January Ist, 1850.
The following letter, which is of the greatest importance, will show by
whom the plates were engraved, the number of subjects on each plate, and the
material of which the plate was composed ;
General Post Office,
Sir, Sydney, 21 December, 1849.
I do myself the honor to submit the undermentioned accounts for copper-
plate engravings of the postage stamps, and request you will obtain authority for my
including them in abstract.
2. The amount can be paid out of the sum voted for this department for the
current year, a balance of ,£5,800 remaining unexpended ; but in explanation of the
difference in price, I beg to state that I was obliged to employ separate engravers, the
plates being urgently required, and that I made the best arrangement I could under the
circumstances.
Robert Clayton, for furnishing a copper plate containing twenty-five engravings of
the penny postage stamp, ten pounds (£ 10).
John Carmichael, for furnishing a copper plate containing twenty-four engravings
of the two-penny postage stamp, twelve pounds twelve shillings (£l2 125.).
H. C. Jervis, for furnishing a copper plate containing twenty-five engravings of
the three-penny postage stamps, seven pounds (£7).
Charles Kay, for providing articles required in printing postage stamps, five
pounds eleven shillings and nine-pence (£5 11s. 9d.).
Amounting in all to thirty-five pounds three shillings and nine-pence sterling.
I have, &c.,
The Honorable the Colonial Secretary. JAS. RAYMOND.
From this letter, then, we learn that the plates were of copper. The
names of the engravers were, for the Id. Robert Clayton; for the 2d., John
Carmichael; and for the 3d., H. C. Jervis. The number of stamps on each plate
were, for the Id., 25; for the 2d., 24; and for the 3d., 25. In addition to the
above, the amount paid to the various engravers is given. Charles Kay also
received the sum of £5 11s. 9d. “ for providing articles required in printing
postage stamps.” This most likely included the printing press. To philatelists,


it will be of interest to know that this identical press is carefully preserved in
the Government Printing Office, and it is with much pleasure that we give a
picture of this venerable relic. (Plate YIII.)
Attached to the document is a minute by the Colonial Secretary, approving
of the expenditure, and authorising the payment of the sum named, from a vote
of the Council.
The following list of ingredients for preparing the colours used for printing
from these plates, is taken from a paper in the Colonial Secretary’s Office:—
For the Id. : scarlet lake, four parts ; Chinese Vermillion, two parts; flake white,
one part. For the 2d. : ultramarine, nine parts ; Chinese blue, one part; flake white,
two parts. For the 3d. ; mineral green, six parts ; crystal green, two parts ; flake white,
one part. The official record of the colours in which these stamps were printed is as
follows : —ld., crimson lake, scarlet lake; 2d,, ultramarine ; 3d., mineral green, emerald
green.
These are somewhat different from those given by Mr. Richards in his list.
As to the design of these stamps, it was taken from the Great Seal of the
Colony, which arrived in H.M.S. “ Gorgon” on September 21st, 1791. This
seal was used for many years ; but, when the new one was sent out, it was
ordered to be returned to England for the purpose of being broken up. I vas
at some trouble to, obtain an impression from this seal, and, after a lengthy
search, a wax impression, attached to an old deed, was found in the office of the
Colonial Secretary. It was in rather a damaged state; but as it was the only
one available, I was glad to avail myself of the permission, readily given, to have
it repaired and copied. This has been most admirably done, under the skilful
direction of Mr. Potter, the Government Printer and Inspector of Stamps; and
now, for the first time, is given a correct representation of this most interesting
memento of the early days of the Colony. (Plate X.) The following description
is taken from Collins’ “ Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,
1804”:
In determining the device for the seal of the Colony, attention had been paid to
its local and peculiar circumstances. On the obverse were the king’s arras, with the
royal titles in the margin ; on the reverse a representation of convicts landing at Botany
Bay, received by Industry, who, surrounded by her attributes, a bale of merchandise, a
beehive, a pick axe, and a shovel, is releasing them from their letters, and pointing to
oxen ploughing, and a town rising on the summit of a hill with a fort for its protection.
The masts of a ship are seen in the bay. In the margin are the words, “ Sigillum Nov.
Camb. Aust.,” and for a motto “ Sic fortis Etruria crevit.” The seal was of silver, and
the devices were extremely well executed.
It may liere be mentioned that the view very closely resembles an old
view of Sydney taken from Bennelong’s Point,


From a very careful examination of the official records, I have come to the
conclusion that there was but one plate ever prepared of each value, but in the case
of the Id., and the 2d., this plate was retouched or sharpened, as occasion required.
Taking first the Id., it is evident, from used specimens, that there were two
states of the plate ; first, finely engraved, and secondly, coarsely engraved. Now,
which of these came first ? From two envelopes in my possession, the first of
which bears a pair of Id. views , finely engraved, without clouds, and is dated June
2nd, 1850; the second, also, bears a pair of coarsely engraved Id. views, with
clouds, and bears the date stamp of November 6th, 1851, it is clear that the
finely engraved stamp came first. Taking into consideration, also, the question
of engraving, it is evident that it is a matter of impossibility in retouching a
plate to make a coarse line fine; exactly the opposite would result. Who
retouched the plate ? From extracts from a letter from the Postmaster-General
to the Colonial Secretary, which I shall give later on, it will be seen that neither
Clayton nor Jervis were in favour at this time, on account of the inferior work
done by them on the one-penny and three-penny plates. And as Carmichael’s
work was so highly approved of, and also from the nature of the work, it is
certain that he retouched the plate.
The plate continued in use until December 20th, 1851, as we learn by a
Gazette notice, dated December 18th, 1851.
The two-penny plate. This is much more difficult to deal with than
either of the others, but I think I shall be able to prove conclusively that there
was but one plate, but numerous sharpenings, and retouches. There is no doubt
that the plate engraved by Carmichael was the finely engraved one with perpen-
dicular lines. Now, from a letter dated January sth, 1850, from the Postmaster-
General to the Colonial Secretary, it is evident that the plates even at that early
date were showing signs of wear. He did not wish to imply that there were not
mechanics in the Colony capable of engraving stamps, but that there was a difficulty
in multiplying dies upon steel plates for want of the requisite machinery. Under
these circumstances he considered it advisable to obtain steel plates containing at
least one hundred impressions from England. The plates were not to be more than
12 or 14 inches in width, so as to answer for the printing press recently provided.
He submitted specimens of the stamps in use, and suggested that the
design (taken from the Great Seal) might easily be forged, and that it would be
better to have a single object on a machine-ruled ground, like the English
stamps. But the best security against forgery would be a paper manufactured
specially for the stamps, and suggested that a supply should be forwarded with


the plates, upon the receipt of which there would be no difficulty in providing from
20,000 to 30,000 stamps daily under the present management. The minute on this
papei is to the effect that “ Mr, Ham will shortly be in Sydney and will submit pro-
posals. ’ This first stage of the two-penny plate was allowed to wear out almost com-
pletely , many of the specimens showing scarcely any trace of perpendicular lines.
On a letter from the Crown Solicitor to the Colonial Secretary, dated
February 18th, 1851, with reference to a bond which Carmichael was to sign,
the following minute appears :
The present plates, especially the two-penny one, are much worn, and require
jrequent sharpening.
On February 28th, 1851, Mr. J. C. Boyd gave evidence before the Post
Office Board, to the effect that
with the present plates it is almost impossible to keep pace with the demand. It is
a necessary to have a large stock on hand, as from the state of the present
plates we do not know how soon they may become unserviceable, and any repairs would
put a stop to all printing for a fortnight at least.
In this, then, there is no suggestion of new plates, only repairs. Now, let us
turn to Boyd and Manning’s letter of March 25th, 1851, which I give in extenso : —
r ’ Stamp Office, 25 March, 1851.
Enclosed we beg to hand for inspection one sheet sample impression of the
two-penny postage stamp. The plate from which this impression was struck has been
three times repaired, and is now nearly unfit for use.
Cfarmichael is under contract to furnish steel plates for the three kinds of stamps
y the end of June; but we know that the penny and three-penny plates are not com-
menced; and the two-penny (the one most required) barely more than half completed,
anc will not be deliverable for at least six weeks. Serious inconvenience will thus arise,
as our printer says he will not be able to work off more than 20,000 (four days’ work)
from the two-penny plate.
Under these circumstances, we do ourselves the honor to request that such steps
may be taken as will enable us to continue our issue to the public. The present plate
might again be repaired as heretofore in this office. This will take at least sixteen days,
rom y to 5 o clock ; but, anticipating our present position, we have a considerable supply
on hand, enough, we think, to prevent any inconvenience while the plate is in the hands
ot the engraver.
We shall feel obliged by your returning the enclosed sheet (forty-eight stamps) at
your earliest convenience, as no note is made in our books of its issue.
We have, &c.,
J. C. C. BOYD.
A. W. MANNING.
The repairs of the plate may be authorised to be effected as quickly as possible,
and the necessity of expediting the execution and completion of the new plates
upon Mr. Carmichael.—C. W. R., 31st.
irom this we find that up to that date the plate had been three times
repaired, and the minute authorises a fourth repair. Another important point


is now brought forward for the first time, and that is, the plates were repaired
in the Stamp Office. That this was no simple matter may be gathered from the
fact that the proposed repair was estimated to take “at least sixteen days, from
9to 5 o’clock.” Another link in the chain of evidence, as to the identity of this
plate is given in Boyd’s evidence. In answer to Mr. Lamb’s question:
Who engraved the plates at present used I —Engravers of plates —Clayton, the
Id., Carmichael the 2d., and Jervis the 3d.
From all this it is evident that the plates then (February 28th, 1851) in use,
and which Mr. Tapling, in “ Oceania,” has shown to be what he calls Plate 111,
first retouch, was the identical plate which was originally engraved by Carmichael;
and, as Mr. Tapling acknowledges the plate with the pearl to be simply a retouch
of this plate, it appears that the ground is completely cut from under that
gentleman’s feet. The repair ordered on the 31st of March must have been then
the so-called second retouch of Plate 111. From the plate annexed, showing the
present state of the plate (Plate XI), we know for certain that this is the
“ pearl,” and as the new steel plate for the two-penny laureated came into use on
July 24th, 1851; and, supposing even that the engraver got to work at once,
and completed his labours in sixteen days, that brings us down to April 16th,
which only gives a life of three months, in which time there could scarcely have
been any further repairs, judging by the present state of the plate.
Now, having the “pearl” plate in existence, let us reason back from that
to the first plate. And in doing so, I shall take the arguments advanced by the
authors of “ Oceania,” and deal with them in order.
“Plate 111, second retouch.” (Page 25). “The fact is placed beyond
doubt that what we have called retouches are simply different stages of the
same original plate.” This is precisely what lam contending for. “ Once grant
the possibility of some process of re-duplication being known in the Colony at the
time (and this is proved by the essays of the one-penny), it becomes by no means
improbable that it was employed for the plates of the two-penny No
process then known, save the Perkins, could have produced this result.” The
fact is, that no such process was known in the Colony at the time. The so-called
Id. essays, of which we give an example on Plate VII, fig. /, were reproduced
by lithography some eighteen years later.
Plate 111, first retouch. This, like the last, is acknowledged by Mr.
Tapling to be simply a retouch.
Plate 111. This takes us back to October, 1850. Now, as the new steel
plate for the laureated issue did not come into use until after July 21st, 1851, it


is evident from Mr. Tapling’s own showing, that (with the largely increased use
of postage stamps in 1851) this same piece of copper did service, with “ repairs,”
from October, 1850, to July, 1851—nine months ! That was not bad service, as,
according to Mr. Tapling, the “ original” plate had to be entirely replaced by a
new one about April, and this again, by the one we are considering, about
October. This is strange, as we know that the quantity of stamps was so much
larger in 1851 than in 1850. Possibly the quality of the copper was not so good.
But still, the fact (?) remains, that the plate, with less work, was entirely replaced
three times in nine months, while the third plate, with probably double work,
only needed repairing twice. So much for theories. Mr. Tapling acknowledges
that the points of resemblance are numerous and strongly marked between Plates
II and 111, and states that the question of a retouch or transfer is difficult to
determine. Now, taking up the various points, the same irregularities of position
of the stamps and their surrounding lines occur in exactly the same positions.
The relative positions of the words in the circular band to other portions of the
design—those of the words “ postage ” and “ two-pence ” in respect of the corner
blocks, and in some cases even the shape of the letters and oval reticulations at
the sides—are almost identical on both plates. Mr. Tapling acknowledges that
“ these points of resemblance fit in equally well with the theory of a retouch.”
Lastly, he quotes an extract from the Sydney Government Gazette of April
2nd, 1851 (does he mean the letter of March 25th, 1851 ?), stating that the
Governor had approved of the repair of the plates of the two-pence . Mr. Philbrick
states with reference to this, “If singular, all the above is unsupported.” A
reference to the letter will show that the word is “plate.” We can, therefore,
only come to the conclusion that Plates 111 and II were both engraved on the same
sheet of copper.
Plate 11. It is quite evident that very little remained of the original design
(Plate I re-touched), beyond a few of the straight lines of the stamps, a little of the
lettering, and the lines of the compartments It is certainly a curious
coincidence that the same irregularities occur in the same places on Plate IV,” &c.
Mr. Tapling here enters into the details of the resemblance, pointing out
especially the relative position of the inscription, “ Two-pence,” to the white
corner blocks. These peculiarities and irregularities occur in the same place on
both plates. In the early days of postage stamp engraving in the Colony lam
afraid that the system of re-engraving by transfer would not have been so closely
followed as this shows it to have been done. Mr. Philbrick says :
I am more disposed to believe that the engravers altered and varied and finally
suppressed the added or reruled lines, so that in the latest printings from Plate I they


entirely disappear, rather than that there was a second plate so absolutely identical with
the first as to have no points of difference whatever between these ruled lines. No
process then known, save the Perkins, could have produced this result.
The first part of this is intended to apply to Plate I, retouched; but it
equally applies to the plates following; and we know that the Perkins’ process
requires a steel die, whereas these plates were of copper.
Mr. Philbrick, on page 56, continues, after describing the process of
transfer :
If the workman be careful, his very fidelity reproduces the old design—errors,
varieties, and peculiarities, down to the least ink-mark. And this is what happened in
these transfers.
We all know what happened when Jervis re-engraved the six-penny plate.
All trace of Carmichael’s ground-work disappeared, and with it the error
“ Walls.” Hence we must imply that Jervis was one on whose fidelity we
cannot rely.
Mr. Philbrick further states :
I have come to the conclusion that when the engraver set about his work his
first idea was to engrave on the plate another row of stamps above the existing top row;
that he began to mark the spaces out in which to engrave them ; but before he had
completed the lines of these compartments it occurred to him that the press was not
large enough to print from a plate of the size which this addition would cause.
Again: .
It is inconceivable the engraver should have begun to rule the lines if the copper-
plate itself was not large enough to take at least one other row of stamps.
Turn now for an instant to the illustration of the destroyed plate, and we
find that the surmises of both Mr. Philbrick and Mr. Tapling are correct. There
was ample room for another row of stamps; and, curiously enough, the room is
above and not below. We can hardly suppose that if the plate were renewed
several times the engravers in each instance should have so exactly copied the
original plate as to leave space for another row of stamps at the top. Further,
what need was there for resorting to the process of transfer, when the outlines
required already existed on a substantial plate of copper ? In its present state,
the plate is nearly one-eighth of an inch thick, and consequently would bear a
good many more “ repairs.” The question of how the perpendicular lines were
removed and horizontal lines substituted, is most readily solved by again refer-
ring to the six-penny. In this case it did not so nearly wear out as Plate I
(retouched) of the two-penny. Yet the closest examination fails to reveal any
trace of the fine groundwork of Carmichael; and although stated to be a transfer,


it was only a retouch by Jervis. So in the case of the two-penny. When the
plate was cleaned for re-engraving, the remainder of the perpendicular lines were
removed, and the horizontal ones substituted.
In dealing with this two-penny plate, I have quoted largely from a paper
of mine which was read before the Philatelic Society of London on November 30th,
1688, and which will be found in the Philatelic Record for December, 1888.
The following memorandum, dated November 30th, 1851, from the Post-
master-General, for the information of the Governor-General, convey all we desire
to know about the three-penny plate :
The present plate is copper, and though in use for nearly two years, and has never
been repaired, may be said to be as good as when delivered by the engraver. Being well
cut it would last many years longer.
Having now dealt with the details of the individual members of this
interesting series, let us see what is known of their “ life history,” printing, &c.
As to the method of printing, and other details, it seems to me the better
plan to give Mr. Boyd’s evidence before the Post Office Board in extenso , as it is
of the greatest importance :
John Curwen Boyd, Esquire, examined :
1. By the Chairman: You are one of the Inspectors of Stamps at the Post
Office ?—Yes. F
2. How long have you held that office ?—-Since the first of this month ; I
performed the duties two or three days in last month.
3. What is the nature of the duties you perform ?—To superintend the printing of
the stamps , to keep an account of those printed \ and to issue them, as they are wanted,
to the Postmaster-General.
4. On what requisition do you issue them ?—The plan adopted before I went to the
office is followed by me ;it is this : —One of the clerks calls generally from 11 to 2
o clock, and states what quantity of stamps he requires j he then brings his own book, and
we see him enter them ; I then enter them in mine, and he places his initials against the
entry, and at the end of the week our book is taken to Mr. Baymond, and signed by him
as having received the stamps entered.
5. Are you always present at the issue of stamps ?—Yes.
G. Who is associated with you in the office ?—Mr. Arthur Manning \ for the first
few days Mr. Wyse was there, but he has left.
7. Mr. Manning is present with you at the issuing of the stamps ?—Yes, generally.
8. You never issue stamps alone ?—Seldom • but should either be absent at the
moment a requisition is received, we do not hesitate to issue the stamps singly.
9. Do you keep the key of the room? —We have three locks on the door, and
neither of us can get into the room without the other, as we each have a key
10. Who has the third key ?—Mr. Manning has two keys, and I have one.
11. How is it that Mr. Manning has two keys?—There is a common door key, and
two extra keys belonging to the patent locks on the door; I keep one of these patent
keys? and Mr. Manning keeps the other and the common door key. There is an iron
plating put inside the door.
G


12. By Mr. Griffiths : Is the printer at work all day I ?—When I was appointed I
was told that one or two days a week would be quite sufficient for me to attend, but we
have been there, with the exception of two days, every day since our appointment,
superintending the printing and issuing of these stamps; in fact, with the present plates,
it is almost impossible to keep pace with the demand, as it is necessary to keep a con-
siderable quantity on hand to meet the calls made upon us by the Country Postmasters.
It is absolutely necessary to have a large stock on hand, as from the state of the present
plates we do not know how soon they may become unserviceable, and any repairs would
put a stop to all printing for a fortnight at least. At present we have about 40,000
on hand, including all amounts.
13. The printer can never work unless you are present?—The plates are taken
from him the moment his work is done ; they are cleaned and locked up in the iron
chest, and there has never been a stamp printed without one or both of us being present.
14. By Mr. Thacker: Is it always the same clerk who comes to you for stamps ?
—Yes; Mr. Nelson.
15. He signs his initials in your book ?—Yes. There is a book with three
columns, to show the various kinds of stamps; he says, I want so many of one kind, so
many of another; we give them to him, and enter them in our book. I see that he
enters the right quantity in his book, and he sees that I enter the right quantity in mine,
and signs his initials in pencil; every week this book is sent down to the Postmaster-
General by Mr. James Raymond.
16. Why should not Mr. Nelson put his initials in ink ?—He might do so ; but
we consider that we deliver the stamps to the Postmaster-General.
17. By Mr. Lamb: When the book goes down to Mr. Raymond, Mr. Nelson’s
initials are thought to be a sufficient guarantee that the number entered in your book
have been received by him ?—The first time I took the book to Mr. Raymond to be signed,
thinking that Mr. Nelson’s initials would be considered a sufficient guarantee, but Mr.
Raymond said he could not sign it, as he must have it examined, to see whether the
number charged had been actually received, and he signed the book the next day.
18. Then the book remained out of your hands till the next day ?—No, it is never
out of my possession.
19. Is it not out of your possession when it is carried by Mr. James Raymond
from your room to the Postmaster-General ? —Yes; but one of us generally goes with it.
20. By Mr. Thacker : Could there be any possible objection to this clerk’s initials
being written in ink ?—None whatever. I will have them written in ink in future if it
be thought necessary.
2L By Mr. Lamb : At present there seems to be some danger, as if the party were
so disposed he might have an opportunity of erasing his initials—you say that a week
elapses before the Postmaster’s signature is put to the book?—Yes; but Mr. Nelson
never has my book in his possession.
22. You suppose so, and very likely correctly suppose so; but you have no positive
assurance that it is not sometimes taken into Mr. James Raymond’s office, where Mr.
Nelson is clerk, and inadvertently left there?—That is what is called the public book ;
but besides that, Mr. Manning and I keep a private book of all the stamps that are
printed, issued, or destroyed, to which no person has access but ourselves, and we check
that every day. Mr. James Raymond’s room and Mr. Nelson’s room are at opposite
ends of the passage.
23. By Mr. Thacker; After the stamps are issued by you to the Postmaster,
generally on a requisition coming to you verbally through one of the clerks, have you any
farther knowledge of what becomes of them ?—No; we issue only to Mr. Nelson.


24. By the Chairman : Has it not struck you that it would bo better for you to
have a written requisition from the Postmaster-General ?—According to the instructions
received from the Colonial Secretary, I do not think that Mr. Manning and myself are
called upon to keep any stamps on hand. I have with me the letter from the Colonial
Secretary, which is as follows :
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Gentlemen, Sydney, 6 February, 1851.
With reference to my letter of the 29th ultimo, appointing you to superintend the printing
of the postage stamps, I am now directed by His Excellency the Governor to inform you that it will be
necessary for you to sign a joint certificate with the printer of the number of stamps struck off, and to
hand them over to the Postmaster-General, obtaining his receipt for the same.
I do not know whether that means that as the stamps are struck off every day they are to
be given to the Postmaster-General, and that we are not to keep them on hand. It then
goes on—
2. The receipt, with your certificate above-mentioned, are to be forwarded to the Auditor-General.
3. The plates are to be deposited in the iron chest, the key of which is to remain in your possession.
25. The letter does not say anything about putting the stamps into the iron
chest ?—No.
26. It states that you are to sign a certificate with the printer—do you do so?—
Our certificate will go in to the Government at the end of the month ; the printer has not
yet signed it.
27. It is a joint certificate from yourselves and the printer ?—Yes. The issue has
been made for to-day, and I suppose the certificate will go in to-morrow to the Auditor-
General.
28. By Mr. Lamb : In that certificate no notice is taken of the number remaining
on hand ?—Yes, there is.
29. According to your instructions, the certificate in which the printer joins has
reference only to the number struck off ?—Yes ; but for our own satisfaction we make it
very full.
30. Does the printer join you with reference to the number on hand ?—He knows
nothing about the number of stamps issued; he merely signs the certificate of the number
of stamps printed.
31. Then in reality you go beyond your instructions in being so minute as to
give a statement of what you have on hand in the chest?—We give a complete monthly
statement showing the balance. This is made in duplicate, one for the Colonial Secretary’s
Office, and the other for the Auditor-General’s.
32. Do you not think it would be better to remove the whole of the Stamp Depart-
ment from the Post Office to the Treasury ? —I do not know whether there would be room
but if there were I think it would be as well. The drying of 5,000 stamps requires a
great deal of room.
33. By Mr. Griffiths : Does it take a day to dry them ?—According to the weather,
we have had a fire in the room since I have been there. The printer recommends that
there should be a proper place fitted up with horse hair lines to dry them as they are
printed. There are at present three kinds of stamps issued—one penny, two-penny, and
three-penny; there are about two two-penny issued to one one penny, and about six and
a half two-penny to one three-penny,
34. By the Chairman: Do you think if there were sixpenny and shilling stamps
issued they would be much used ?—I think settlers and storekeepers up the country
would use them extensively as small coin.
35. By Mr. Lamb: In many cases 6d. has to be paid upon a letter; if those
payments could be made by stamps, would not stamps of that value be a great convenience
to the public ?—I think so,


36. Are you aware that in England eight-penny and one shilling stamps are used ?
—Yes. I think they were struck off for the overland postage.
37. Might not these stamps be used to pay for registered or late letters; would it
not be a convenience to the public if parties could pay for their letters by affixing these
stamps instead of paying the money in at the window ?—I think it would.
38. By Major Christie: In fact the three-penny stamps are of no use for the
payment of colonial postage; but six-penny stamps would be ? Three-penny stamps are
used for ship letters.
39. By Mr. Thacker : The stamps, after they are struck off, are laid on the floor
to dry, and are left there all night?—ln the first place they are dried before they are
gummed; they are spread on a table and left till the next morning, when they are
gathered together and put under a weight.
40. If they were to be hung upon lines in the way you have suggested, they would
still have to be exposed all night?—Yes.
41. Then the windows of the room in which they are kept ought to be properly
secured ?—Yes.
42. By the Chairman : You do now occasionally destroy stamps; how do you do
that ?—By fire.
43. Who are present at the time; and under what authority is it done?—The
Postmaster-General wrote to the Colonial Secretary upon the subject, and received the
following answer :
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sir, Sydney, 3 August, 1850.
In acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, No. 50-57, forwarding returns
of postage stamps printed and issued for the months of May and June last, I do myself the honor to
inform you that His Excellency the Governor approves of the stamps which have been sent back from
the country post offices, as injured by wet, being returned to the printing-room and destroyed as damaged
stamps, the number so destroyed being duly entered in the monthly return furnished to the Auditor-
General by the gentlemen in charge of the printing room.
I have, &c.
(For the Colonial Secretary),
W. ELYARD, JUNR.
44. You find that a good many of these damaged stamps are sent to the Post
Office from my office ?—I do not know where they come from,
45. A good many of these are tom and defaced before they come into my office ?
We do not issue them from our office in that state.
46. These stamps that are returned to the Post Office torn and defaced, are they
brought to your room to be destroyed ?—They are taken to the Postmaster-General, and
when he has a number, he brings them to us.
47. They are not destroyed till they come to you ?—No ; we enter them in stock,
and when destroyed we write them off as destroyed.
48. By Mr, Thacker: You give the Postmaster-General credit for those returned?
—Yes.
49. By Mr. Lamb : Therefore in your monthly returns he is only debited with the
quantity issued to him, minus the quantity returned? —No; he is debited with the total
number issued to him ; those sent by him to be destroyed in this office are not deducted
from that total; they appear in our books under a special heading, and when destroyed
are written off per contra.
50. The book in which the entry is made is in your room, at the Post Office ?—Yes.
51. By Mr. Griffiths: How many days in the week do you attend at the Post
Office ? —I have attended every day in this month except one.
52. Are you required to be there every day to superintend the printing ? —The
number of stamps issued last month was 78,000, or nearly 3,000 a day.


53 How long does it take to print 3,000 ?— A long time ; 6,000 is a day’s work,
the printing alone, without the gumming.
54. Does the printer commence his work at 8 o’clock ?—No ; we go at half-past 9
o’clock, and have done there about half-past 4 or 5 o’clock.
55. It has been stated that the printer wished to be employed from 8 o’clock till
6, and that he had been allowed to do so?—He has not continued to do so; he is not
paid by the day, but by the thousand.
56. By the Chairman: What is he paid per thousand for printing ?—One shilling,
and he cannot earn 6s. a day,
57. By Mr. Lamb: Has the printer to gum them for that sum?—Yes; he says
that when he agreed to do the work it was understood that the stamps were to be 100
on a plate, but the plates at present used have only twenty-five on them, so that he has
nearly four times the work to do. There is no probability of getting the plates required
here.
58. Who engraved the plates at present used ?—Engravers of plates—Clayton,
the one penny ; Carmichael, the two-penny ; and Jervis, the three-penny. The number
of stamps printed in January, 1851, were 73,914, and in this month 86,096, the issue for
this the last day of February having been made before I left the office. I may mention
that stamps are issued to public offices at 4 per cent, discount, but are received from the
same departments at their full value, thereby entailing a loss to the Post Office of 4 per
cent, as above stated. Stamps, one penny, Bs. per 100; two-penny, 16s. per 100; three-
penny, 245. per 100.
59. By Major Christie: Do you not conceive that this 4 per cent, should be
allowed only to persons who sell stamps ?—I do.
60. By Mr. Lamb : Might not a boy be trained to the gumming of the stamps, so
as to allow the printer to devote the whole of his time to the printing ?—Yes.
61. The only inconvenience would be that you would then have two parties to
watch over instead of one?—There would be no difficulty in doing this, because we know
the number put out to dry.
62. By Mr. Thacker : I apprehend the printer has a contract ?—No; he had a
contract for six or seven hundred thousand, but he did not like to enter into a contract
for any more.
63. Does he print them for Is. a thousand, including gumming ?—Yes, but he has
had a very hard bargain ; if he had new plates he might print nearly double the number.
64. With the same mechanical labour?—No, the plates would require a little
more cleaning.
From this evidence we have sufficient data to estimate the number of
stamps issued for 1851. The number of stamps of all denominations issued in
January, 1851, was 73,904; in February, 1851, 86,096. Allowing for a fair
proportional increase, this will give an issue of about 1,100,000 for the year.
The proportion in which the Sydney views were issued was two two-penny to one
one-penny, six and a half two-penny to one three-penny. This will give for the
six months ending Juno 30th, 1851, the following proportion, taking 500,000 as
the total number issued during that period; —Id,, 151,163; 2d., 302,326; 3d.
46,511.

interior of New South Wales are conducted may be furnished to the Postmaster-General
of this Colony, together with a copy of each of the forms in present use. I annex several
questions, to which I would desire replies in the event of the regulations above referred
to not affording the information required. And I beg to add that I should feel further
obliged by the Post Office authorities at Sydney kindly suggesting any improvements in
their present regulations which from experience they conceive to be desirable.

Copy of queries from Postmaster-General of Van Diemen s Land, and replies thereto
respecting the printing and issue of postage stamps.

press obtained in Sydney or from the plates engraved by Messrs. Carmichael and Jervis
England? —engravers resident in Sydney —each plate, with one
exception, the six-penny, which has only twenty-five,
contains fifty labels. The following are steel plates,
which are the most enduring, viz., Id., 2d., and 3d.
The following copper, 6d. and Bd. Any procured from
England in future will be steel,

2. In what building are the
dies and printing press placed,
and under whose custody 1
3. What description of officers
are present at the time of the
stamps being struck off, and how
many ?
4. Are the stamps printed in
sheets and stitched into books,
bound, and numbered 1
5. What means have been
adopted to prevent stamps being
struck off without authority or
from being stolen after having
been struck off by authority ?
6. What means of preventing
forgeries are in operation, or of
detecting forgeries if committed 1
The Stamp Office occupies a portion of the General
Post Office building, where the dies and printing press
are kept under the custody of the Inspector of Stamps;
but this is not considered an advantageous arrange-
ment. A building detached, but near the Post Office,
would be better.
The Inspector of Stamps, who has the sole charge of
the department. Formerly, there were two inspectors;
but under recent precautions one has been considered
sufficient.
The paper on which the stamps are printed is bound
into books, the butt of each sheet of paper bearing a
scroll impression, varied in colour, according to the
description of stamp, so as to designate the paper in-
tended for the printing of one-penny, two-penny,
three-penny, &c., stamps respectively; each book con-
tains about 250 sheets. When required for printing the
sheets are cut out through the scroll. They are issued
in that state after being printed and gummed, and the
butts of the books are forwarded to the Audit Office.
It will be seen under the head of “ Suggestions,”
that additional precautions of having water-marks and
diagonal threads on the paper are contemplated.
The books above referred to are procured from the
Colonial Storekeeper, who forwards to the Auditor-
General a monthly return of the number and description
of the books so issued by him to the Inspector of Stamps,
who makes requisition to the Colonial Storekeeper for
the same. The Inspector of Stamps supplies to the
Printer daily a sufficient number of sheets, forwarding
the butts to the Auditor-General as a check on the
Storekeeper’s return; for on each butt is a certificate
from the Storekeeper of the number of sheets it contains,
as well as his own monthly statement of stamps printed.
The Inspector takes charge of the stamps as printed,
and is provided with a fire-proof safe and secure rooms
for their safe custody.
The above precautions regarding the paper and the
design being made as elaborate as possible, ruled by
machine and of good execution, are at present the only
safeguard against forgery. These precautions, in
addition to the difficulty parties would find in selling
a sufficient quantity to repay them, the expense they
would be put to, the risk they would incur by having
to intrust so many with the secret, together with their
possible detection by comparison with genuine stamps,
and the fact that the sale is not yet sufficiently large
to compensate for the necessary outlay, would, I think,
prevent any attempt at forgery, which would become
still more difficult when the new paper ordered from
England arrives.


7. To whom have the stamps
been intrusted for sale, what are
their several callings, and in what
measure are they remunerated; if
by a percentage, what is its ratel
8. In what manner is the issue
of stamps regulated at Head-
quarters, and by whom I
9. In what manner is the sale
of stamps regulated at the
General Post Office at Sydney ?
10. Are the Postmasters in the
interior supplied with stamps for
sale; and, if so, by whom, and in
what manner ?
11. Have the Postmasters any
allowance beyond their fixed
salaries for the sale of stamps 1
12. What means have been
adopted for checking the supplies
of stamps to Postmasters, and do
they pay for them in advance;
or, if not, what credit is allowed
them 1
No parties unconnected with the General Post Office
Department have been intrusted with the sale of
stamps by the Government; but any shop-keeper can
retail the same should he think proper.
Extract from Colonial Secretary’s letter to Inspector
of Stamps, of August 25th, 1851, contains the follow-
ing instructions :
The stamps are to be struck off under your control, and
issued to the Postmaster-General, on the requisition of that
officer, and in no other way.
The clerk in charge of Stamp Sale Office sells to the
public wholesale in lots of £5 worth, from 10 till 3;
but his assistants retail any less quantity from 9 till 6,
to provide for which the senior clerk issues stamps to
them during the day, according to the demand. At
5 o’clock a balance is struck, and the cash handed
over to the clerk in charge, to be paid to the cashier,
General Post Office, next morning—the proceeds of
sales from 5 till 6 appearing in the following days
collections.
By requisition on the Postmaster-General, who
approves of the supply written for being sent upon
the certificate of the account, that the Postmaster
applying has paid up at least 75 per cent, on his stamp
account. The requisition is then forwarded to In-
spector of Stamps, who issues the necessary numbers
to clerk in charge of Stamp Sale Office, whose duty it
is to pack the stamps in a leather case provided for
this purpose, with a printed receipt (Stamp Sale Office
form, No. ), to be returned, signed by Postmaster,
initialled by himself and an assistant, who are thus
enabled to certify as to the correctness of the number
enclosed in the event of dispute by Postmaster.
An allowance of 10 per cent., and their stamp
account is kept perfectly distinct from their postage
account.
Each Postmaster is in the first instance forwarded
a supply of stamps supposed to be sufficient for three
months, taking the average of his collections. After
that no more is sent him until 75 per cent, of amount
owing on this account has been paid into General
Post Office; but, to prevent inconvenience to the
public, they are strictly enjoined by the regulations to
keep one month’s supply always on hand. When
their supply is exhausted, even if they neglect to
forward a requisition, it is at once known, as the
letters from the office are in such case paid for in
money, and the deficit of stamps at once noticed by
the sorter in the inland branch.


13. If private individuals de-
sire to purchase any large quan-
tity of stamps are they allowed
a percentage ; and, if so, at what
rate 1
14. How is the gum or other
substance by which the stamps
are made adhesive manufactured,
or could a supply be had from
Sydney if required 1
15. Are different forms used
at the several post offices, and if
so what are the different obliter-
ating marks—what are their
numbers and purpose, and are
they obtained in Sydney, or from
England 1
16. What kind of ink is used
for the obliterating stamps or
marks ?
5 per cent, on each lot of £5 worth.
After repeated experiments, no substance has been
found to answer the purpose as well as gum-arabic
and water in proportion of 3 lb. of gum to 5 lb. of
water, strained twice when dissolved and spread over
the sheet of stamps with a painter’s brush, No. 2
size. Of course this gum can be made of any consist-
ence, but I think the above proportions will be found
to answer the purpose best.
All printed forms are the same for each office.
The obliterating stamps for country post offices are
all numbered consecutively (that of General Post
Office has no number) which points out the office at
which a letter has been posted, should the Post-
master have omitted to stamp it with his usual office
stamp; but their chief purpose is to destroy the
postage stamp that it cannot possibly be used a second
time. These are obtained in Sydney.
The ink at present is supplied by the Colonial Agent-
General in London, and is made up from a recipe of
Dr. Lyon Playfair, the ingredients being secret.
It is, however, stated that a good obliterating ink
can be procured from a mixture of what is called
“ Drop Black ” and boiled oil, with a little turpentine
to make it dry quickly. This latter ink is considered
sufficiently permanent to defeat any attempt at
removing the obliterating mark.
With regard to further suggestions, a short detail of improvements proposed for
Sydney Office probably comprise all that is requisite.
Plates 1
Paper 1
Printing Press 1
Colours ?
H
It is proposed that in future these shall be procured
from England, engraved on block steel, and 100 labels
on each plate.
Separate paper to be specially manufactured in
England for each plate, a water-mark indicating the
value of the stamp, which will appear through each
label; and, for further security against frauds, each
stamp or label will also show a diagonal thread line
One of Perkins’ patent presses, with all recent im-
provements, has been ordered from England, and is
daily expected. It will probably cost <£7o, and will
enable the printer to throw off one-third more stamps
during the day.
These can be procured in England at a rate so much
more reasonable than in the Colony that it has been
considered advisable to send for a supply.


Gum ?
License to Sell Stamps 1
As before stated, gum-arabic has been found to
answer best, and has been hitherto easily procured in
the Colony at a reasonable price.
At present there is nothing to prevent private
individuals purchasing stamps wholesale at 5 per cent,
discount, and retailing them ; but I think the system
practised in England, compelling parties who wish to
sell stamps to take out a license, would work well and
be an additional security against fraud I should
recommend, therefore, a clause to this effect being
introduced at Hobart Town. By a recent notice, I see
the fee charged on these licenses has been abolished.
On July 9th, 1853, the Postmaster-General wrote to the Colonial Secretary
relative to additional precautions being taken in the Department of the Inspector
of Stamps. He recommended that Kay, the printer, should be required to furnish
securities, his own personal bond for £2OO and two responsible parties in £lOO
each, and, that a Board be appointed from time to time to report upon the stock
of stamps in hand, the number of damaged stamps, and the state of the books of
the office; also that certain instructions should be given to the Inspector.
The following letter will show what the duties of the Inspector of Stamps
were. The letter is the outcome of one addressed by the Secretary of the General
Post Office, Melbourne, to the Postmaster-General of New South Wales, in which
he states that as the new Postage Bill is before the Legislative Council of that
Colony, some information is desired as to the duties required from that officer: —
Sir, Stamp Office, Sydney, 17 May, 1854.
In attention to your request, I have the honor to subjoin, for the information
of the Postmaster-General of Victoria, a statement of the nature of the duties required of
me as Inspector of Stamps.
2. I would first observe that previous to the 26th June, 1851, the stamps were
printed under the supervision of two Inspectors ; but from that date the Department was
placed under the control of one person, when Mr. Manning was appointed to its sole
management as Inspector of Stamps. Upon that gentleman being nominated to a Com-
missionership of Crown Lands, I was appointed on February Ist, 1852, to succeed him.
3. The principal duties attached to the office are, the safe custody of all plates,
machinery, and materials for printing stamps, the personal supervision during printing,
and the charge of all stamps printed, and their issue upon the several requisitions.
4. All the plates first used were engraved in the Colony, and of the following
values, viz. :
One penny Sixpence and
Two-pence Eight-pence ;
Three-pence
but others of a better description have been ordered from England, with the addition of a
“ five-penny ” plate for a country ship stamp. Of the new plates the “ six-penny ” has
already been received, together with a one shilling plate, which had also been written for.


5. The paper on which the stamps are now printed is procured from England,
specially manufactured for this Colony, and bears a water-mark appearing through each
postage label designating its value. The materials for printing are also now imported, and
one of Perkins’ Patent Printing Presses has been recently received from England,
6. This paper is issued by the Colonial Storekeeper upon requisition, bound in books
containing 150 leaves each. These books are counted by the Inspector and stamped
with the office stamp, and then given to the printer with the plate of the stamp required.
When the day’s work is finished the sheets are counted over and removed to the drying-
room ; the next day they are put into a press to prepare them for the gumming. After
they are gummed they are spread out on shelves, and remain for one or two days until
perfectly dry, when they are gathered up and kept in a fireproof safe until required for
issue.
7. The Governor-General’s instructions for the issue of the stamps, as conveyed
through the Colonial Secretary, state that “ they are to be issued to the Postmaster-
General on the requisition of that officer, and in no other waybut instead of
transferring them in bulk as formerly, the requisitions received by the Postmaster-General
from the Country Postmasters are marked by him “ approved,” and forwarded to the
Inspector, who supplies each requisition separately, and in lots of not less than the value
of £5 each, handing them over to the officer in the General Post Office duly authorised
to receive and sign a receipt for them.
8. Postage stamps are received by officers of the Government as revenue
remittance under £1 ; these are cashed by the Inspector. Such as are serviceable are
re-issued, those unserviceable are condemned and destroyed by the Quarterly Board. To
enable the Inspector to meet this demand, and also to defray the general expenses of the
Department, he receives a quarterly advance from the Treasury.
9. The butts of the books, after the sheets have been cut out, are forwarded to the
Auditor-General, and a statement rendered monthly of all stamps printed, returned,
issued, and destroyed.
10. A Board meets periodically, consisting of the Auditor-General, the Postmaster-
General, and the Colonial Storekeeper, “ for the purpose of examining the stock of
postage stamps on hand and of reporting ” the number of damaged stamps “ and the state
of the books ” of the office, and also of causing the damaged stamps to be destroyed under
the personal superintendence.
11. The other details chiefly consist of keeping the accounts, books, and
correspondence of the office, and other details.
12. The Stamp Office at present occupies three rooms in General Post Office
building. Between the Inspector’s office and the printing-room, glass doors and windows
are fixed in order that the printing may be carried on under the Inspector’s immediate
notice without exposing him to the necessity of remaining in the same room, the materials
used in printing, and gas which is constantly burning to heat the plates, rendering a close
room oppressive and unhealthy. The third room is used as a drying room. The keys of
all the rooms, safes, &c., are under his charge, and he gives security, himself in £5OO, with
two sureties in £250 each. The printer also gives a bond, amounting to £4OO, himself
in £2OO and two sureties in £lOO each.
I have, &c.,
R. P. RAYMOND.


The following circular letter shows the regulations for the postage of
official correspondence, on the abolition of “franking” ;
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sydney, December, 1849.
It having become necessary to establish some new regulation for the postage of official
correspondence, in consequence of the passing of the Act of Council 13 Victoria, No. 38,
which amongst other things abolishes all privileges of “ franking,” I am directed by His
Excellency the Governor to inform you that from the commencement of the new year
the postage on all official communications between public departments must be prepaid
by means of Post Office stamps of the proper value.
2. The necessary supply of stamps of the different values to be used in this Colony
can be obtained by purchase from the Postmaster-General and the several Deputy Post-
masters in the country. To prevent delay, therefore, immediate application should be
made to the nearest Postmaster for a supply of stamps.
3. The stamps so to be issued will have to be accounted for in a regulated form,
which can be obtained from the Colonial Storekeeper.
I have, &c.,
The Colonial Storekeeper should immediately have printed a large number of the
forms Nos. 1 and 2, the former for the Postmaster’s Department, and the latter for other
departments.


III.—THE LAUREATED SERIES.
we have already seen, the Postmaster-General wrote to the Colonial
Secretary on January sth, 1850, suggesting the advisability of getting
s^ plates from England. On October 28th, 1850, he again wrote,
reporting on Clayton’s offer to engrave steel plates for postage stamps
at 255. a head. He states, “ that from the trouble and disappointment
sustained last year by Clayton’s non-performance of work he engaged for, and
the manner in which he engraved the Id. stamp, now in use, I do not feel justified
in recommending his employment on the present occasion.” He then submits
Carmichael’s offer, as he believes him “to be the most competent engraver in
Sydney.” Carmichael was to do them at 255. a head. He then states that
“ Ham is unable to come up from Melbourne at present.” H. C. Jervis offered
to do them at 16s. a head; but “on account of the three-pence now in use not
being a good specimen of engraving,” he could not recommend him.
On November 13th, the Postmaster-General notified to the Colonial Secre-
tary, that he had communicated with Carmichael, and that he had consented to
engrave three steel plates containing fifty postage stamps on each, of the design
approved of by His Excellency, for £l5O, the same to be completed on or before
June 30th, 1850. The Colonial Secretary required him to sign a bond to that
effect; but in addition to being both deaf and dumb, he appears to have had a will
of his own, as he absolutely refused to sign any document, and this, in spite of all
the pressure the Crown Solicitor could bring to bear on him; and he did not
sign the bond.
In November, 1851, designs for six-penny and one shilling stamps were
submitted, which had been engraved by Carmichael. I have given a copy of
these on Plate VII, fig. a. The following is the description of them :
A. Crown in the centre of laurel wreath; stars in the corners; “ New
South Wales ” in the upper label, and arched underneath (as in the
laureated series) the word “ postage”; in lower label “ sixpence ” ;
engine-turning at the sides,


B. Crown, surmounted by a lion, in the centre of a large oval garter
overlapping the engine-turned sides; stars in corners. The garter
is inscribed “ New South Wales” and “ postage” in upper, and
“ one shilling ” in lower label.
These two essays must have been engraved side by side on the same plate.
The original designs for these were drawn by James Raymond, the
Postmaster-General, with especial reference to the importance of making a very
marked distinction between stamps of these higher amounts and those in common
use. Some further information as to their proposed issue is contained in Boyd’s
evidence. Ham furnished designs, which are given on Plate VII, figs, c and d.
The steel plate for the two-penny stamp was not approved of by the Governor
until July 21st, 1851, on which date it was returned to the Inspector of Stamps,
and gazetted, and the issue commenced immediately after. The one penny plate
was approved of, on December 18th, 1851.
The question now arises, what was the order in which the two-penny
plates were issued ? On August Bth, 1853, I find a letter from the Colonial
Secretary to the Inspector of Stamps, acknowledging his letter reporting that
“ the steel plate for printing the two-penny postage stamps had become from
constant use so worn that it would shortly be necessary to have it repaired.” In
reply His Excellency approved of employing H. 0. Jervis “ to engrave a new
copper two-penny plate as nearly similar as possible to the steel plate now in
use, at an expense of £4O, and to repair the steel plate for the sum of £40.”
Now, from the plate in “ Oceania,” bearing the name of H. C. Jervis, Pitt-
street N., Sydney, we know that the plate he engraved was the rough two-
penny with stars in the angles. Therefore this two-penny star plate was merely
an intermediate one between the finely-engraved one on steel by Carmichael and
the coarser re-engraving of the steel plate done by Jervis, which, subsequently,
was printed on water-marked paper.
On an envelope, once in my possession, was a two-penny star, bearing the
date December, 1853. This is the earliest date I can find of the use of this
stamp. As it was only ordered in August, I suppose it will be safe to say that it
did not come into use before November, 1853. The two plates—the copper and
the re-engraved steel, seemed to have been used together, until that on copper
became worn out. Jervis’s copper-plate apparently became worn out before the
introduction of water-marked paper, as I am not aware of any specimen of the
“ Star ” appearing on such paper. Such may, however, be the case, as in the
Government Gazette of January 30th, 1854, appears the following notice :
It is farther notified that for the future all stamps will bear a water-mark on each
label of the value indicated by each respective stamp, with the exception of the eight-penny,
the new paper for which has not yet arrived from England.


The reason may possibly be, that the paper which had been ordered from England,
was that for plates with 100 labels, and as this plate only contained fifty labels,
the paper was not suited for it, so they continued to use the old paper. With
reference to water-marked paper, it appears from a report furnished by the
Postmaster-General to Sir W. Denison, on January 12th, 1853, that the
threaded or water-marked paper used in England, with designation in the water-
mark of values of the respective stamps, had been ordered from England, both
for plates which had been engraved in the Colony and those to be engraved in
England. That this arrived is certain, as appears from a letter from the Post-
master-General to the Colonial Secretary, dated November 23rd, 1853, inquiring
if it is not desirable that application be made to England for a second supply of
the threaded paper for the postage stamps,” and enclosing sheets to be sent for
the purpose of showing the distance at which the silk threads should be placed
apart for the colonial-engraved stamps. I should much like to know if any one
has ever seen any specimens printed on this paper. A further reference to this
threaded paper will be found in the suggestions sent to Van Diemen’s Land.
On May 9th, 1854, a requisition was sent to England by the ship “ Golden Age ”
for water-marked paper, and suggesting that the water-mark should be the
“ value in words,” as a greater precaution against forgery. This does not appear
to have been carried out, as the water-mark continued the same as when first
brought into use. The following letter will show how the paper was used at this
time :
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sydney, 19 July, 1853.
With reference to my letter of the 26th ultimo, appointing you to the sole
management of the Post Office Stamp Department as Inspector of Stamps, I am now
directed by His Excellency the Governor-General to inform you that the Colonial Store-
keeper will furnish you, on requisitions to be made on him, with books with the paper for
stamps for one penny, two-penny, and three-penny stamps. The butts of each sheet of
paper bearing a scroll impression, as proposed by you, varied according to the description
of stamp, so as to designate the paper intended for the printing of one penny, two-penny,
and three penny stamps respectively.
2. Each book which will consist of about 100 sheets is to be bound in the
shape of a bank check-book, and you will be pleased to furnish the Colonial Storekeeper
with any further information he may require in respect to the preparation of these books.
3. An account of those stamps issued by you it will be necessary for you to forward
to the Auditor-General on the 7th of each month in a form which will be furnished you by
that officer, as approved by the Governor-General, and the butts of the stamp books you
will also transmit to him. I have, <fec.

The two-penny steel plate continued in use until 1856, on the 18th January
of which year the Colonial Secretary wrote to the Inspector of Stamps, notifying
a slight alteration in the two-penny plate, and authorising the destruction of the
old plate. The following is a copy of the receipt; —
Received this day from the Inspector of Stamps the old two-penny plate, for
the purpose of being destroyed, in accordance with the Colonial Secretary’s letter of
January 18th, 1856. C. D. Riddell.
John Stirling.
Colonial Treasury, Feb. 12th, 1856. W. H. Christie.
The manner in which this plate was destroyed is well illustrated in
Plate XII. As the metal was steel, the hatchet used did not make such an
impression on it as it did on the two-penny Sydney view plate.
With reference to the destruction of the other plates, Mr. Chapman, the
present Foreman of the Stamp Printing Branch, and who has been con-
nected with the same branch for nearly forty years, informs me that he distinctly
remembers destroying some of the plates—which, he is unable to say. The method
used was to grind the surface down on a grindstone. On February 22nd, 1852,
Mr. Carmichael wrote to the Postmaster-General to know if he was to commence
the engraving of the plate for the six-penny stamps, as the copper-plate was then
ready. The reply was, “To go on with the steel three-penny now in hand.”
The requisite permission was granted on March 16th, 1852, and the terms were
16s. a subject, or £2O for the plate. The plate was copper, and there were
twenty-five subjects on it. It was approved of, and gazetted on May Bth, 1852.
Some little trouble appears to have been had with Carmichael over the
three-penny plate, for we find that on September 29th, 1852, the Postmaster-
General, in reply to a query of the Colonial Secretary, informed him that “ the
new plate for the three-penny stamps will be completed by the 10th proximo.”
On the October 25th, however, the Postmaster-General, evidently in reply to a
further query from the Colonial Secretary, informs him that “ the engraver has
promised the three-penny plate by November Ist without fail.” It was not
until November 27th, 1852, that the Inspector of Stamps submitted the plate
and a proof to the Colonial Secretary. The minute of the Colonial Secretary is
to the effect that “ the plate seems to be executed in a very inferior manner to
those previously engraved by the same artist,” and that “ if the present plate is
approved, the old one is to be destroyed in the presence of a Board as in former
cases.” The Governor gave his approval on December Ist. 1852, and the plate
was returned to the Inspector of Stamps. The Board appointed by the Colonial
Secretary to destroy the plate consisted of the Honorable the Colonial Treasurer,


the Honorable the Auditor-General, and the Postmaster-General, and they were
instructed accordingly. On December 3rd, 1852, the Postmaster-General
forwarded duplicate sheets to the Colonial Secretary, for transmission to
England. On December 6th, the Inspector of Stamps, in a letter to the
Colonial Secretary, acknowledged the receipt of the three-penny plate, and
stated that the old plate had been handed oyer to the Board to destroy, and
enclosed the receipt of the Board.
On January 13th, 1853, the Postmaster-General brought under the notice of
the Colonial Secretary “ the expediency of having an eight-penny stamp for issue
to the public, that being the rate by private ship. The stamp is also desirable
for quadruple postage on inland letters, and will thus relieve the pressure on
the two-penny stamp.” He asks to be allowed to get a copper-plate containing
fifty labels, at a cost not exceeding £25 55., and recommends that a steel plate
be ordered from England containing 100 labels. On the 13th May, the Inspector
of Stamps submitted the eight-penny plate and a proof for approval. In
connection with these proofs, it is only necessary to state that a minute on the
papers exists to say that they were removed by a gentleman, with the authority
of the Colonial Secretary. A portion of the three-penny was reproduced in
“ Oceania.” On May 16th, 1853, this plate, which had been engraved by Jervis,
was returned to the Inspector of Stamps, and gazetted.
I


IV.—THE LARGE SQUARE SERIES.
I I) Jf||| N March 30th, 1853, the Postmaster-General recommended that a nve-
'"Hl liSIiI P enn J be obtained from England. The plate was to contain 100
labels. It was “ required for ship letters posted in the country, and
will there serve the same purpose as the three-penny stamp now does
in Sydney.” He proposed that “it be printed in green, but darker than
the three-penny, and of an oval or pentagonal shape. He also recommended
that books of paper and colours be obtained at the same time. On January 29th,
1852, the Postmaster-General submitted designs for One Shilling and Sixpenny
stamps, stating that the Queen’s head was a copy of the India medal, and had
been designed by Levinge. From the proceedings of the Executive Council for
July sth, 1852, we learn that “His Excellency lays before the Council a letter
from the Postmaster-General, submitting designs for Post Office stamps of the
value of One Shilling and Sixpence respectively.” “ The Council advised the
adoption of the designs, and order the necessary steps to be taken to get the
stamps from England. The artist to be allowed the liberty of introducing such
alterations as his judgment and experience may dictate.”
On September 22nd, 1853, notice was sent to the Postmaster-General by
the Colonial Secretary that “ the Colonial Agent-General has been requested to
procure and forward to the Colony, plates, books, and colours for printing five-
penny and eight-penny postage stamps, and that the sum of £2ll 13s. 6d., the
estimated cost, has been remitted to him.”
The Sixpenny and One Shilling plates arrived from England, and were
gazetted on January 30th, 1854, to come into use on February Ist, 1854.
About the Five-penny and Eight-penny there was some trouble, as will be
seen from the accompanying papers :
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sir, Sydney, 26 November, 1855.
I am directed by His Excellency, the Governor-General, to draw your atten-
tion to the notice published in the Gazette of the 23rd instant, notifying the issue to the
public of five-penny and eight-penny postage stamps on and after the Ist December next.
I have, &c.
(For the Colonial Secretary),
The Postmaster-General.
W. ELYARD.


gj r The Postmaster-General to the Inspector of Stamps.
1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 17th instant,
transmitting for my inspection proofs of the new plates to be received from England for
printing five-penny and eight-penny postage stamps, and pointing out how very much
these differ from those which were ordered from here, and the designs for which were,
after due deliberation, approved of by this country.
2. I beg to express my entire approval of your proposal that the plates should be
at once returned to the Colonial Agent in London as not being in accordance with what
was ordered either in size or design, and would, at the same time, suggest that a special
report of the circumstances be made by you for His Excellency’s information, so that the
item of account, whether directly or indirectly sanctioned by the Colonial Agent, should
not be defrayed by the Colony.
3. Whether an order for new plates, as before applied for, or for other plates at
present more urgently required, should be sent home by you, is a matter of which you
are the best judge, and as to which you can make your own recommendations.
I have, &c.,
W. H. CHRISTIE.
Sir, Stamp Office, 17 September, 1855.
I beg to forward for your inspection proofs of the new plates lately received
from England for printing five-penny and eight-penny postage stamps.
2. These plates, although the execution of them is unexceptionable, have, I regret
to say, been engraved altogether different from the designs furnished, and the directions
forwarded to England with the order have been quite disregarded.
3. Upon a close inspection, it will be perceived that they have been engraved from
the dies of the shilling and sixpenny stamp with merely a different lettering indicating
their value, and a slight alteration in the machine work, thus retaining the only but
serious fault to be found with those plates, viz., the large size of the labels, which was
specially sought to be guarded against in the instructions forwarded to the Colonial Agent-
General, added to which the similarity of the design will lead to very great confusion.
4. Under all the circumstances of the case, I consider it my duty to recommend
that these plates should be returned to the Colonial Agent; and if the engraver has, upon
his own responsibility, departed from the design, he ought to be compelled to furnish
other plates. If he did so with the concurrence of the Colonial Agent, I presume there
will be then no remedy against him.
5. Under any circumstances, I would recommend their being returned; and
probably the Colonial Agent could procure instead of them a four-penny plate, as stamps
of that value are now more useful from the alteration which has been made in the rates
of postage since the five-penny and eight-penny plates were first ordered.
6. As this matter may involve loss to the Government, I shall be much, obliged
by your opinion before referring to the Colonial Secretary.
I have, Ac.,
The Postmaster-General,
R. P. RAYMOND.
Notwithstanding this, the plates were gazetted on 26th November, and
came into use on December Ist, 1855.
Here let me correct an error into which the authors of “ Oceania ” have
fallen. There were 100 stamps to the sheet, and not 50, on each of the plates
of this series. Again, the plates of the sixpence and one shilling were not
printed from in England, except, perhaps, to take proof impressions from, but
were sent out as soon as completed.


V.—THE DIADEM SERIES.
March 14th, 1854, the Colonial Secretary wrote to the Postmaster-
General with reference to a letter which he had received from the
Inspector of Stamps, “ suggesting that new steel plates for one penny,
two-penny, and three-penny postage stamps should be obtained from
England,” and requesting that the Postmaster-General would report
thereon for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General. The report
was to the effect that “ the recommendations contained therein met with his full
concurrence.”
On April sth, an estimate was submitted for procuring a new steel plate for
the two-penny. An estimate and designs were submitted for one penny, and
three-penny plates on April 7th, but it was distinctly to be understood, that the
two-penny was to be obtained first.
On May 19th, duplicates of the estimates and designs for one penny, two-
penny, and three-penny stamps were forwarded for transmission to the Colonial
Agent. These were forwarded, with the request that he would expedite matters,
as they were urgently required.
On May 9th, 1854, the Postmaster-General wrote to the Colonial Secretary,
requesting that the Agent-General might be hurried up with the new two-penny
plate, “ as the present unfortunate plate with its fifty labels is almost in constant
use.” “ One hundred and twenty-three thousand stamps were struck off from it
last month” (April, 1854), and the Postmaster-General feared that it would wear
out before the arrival of the new one. As to getting it repaired, that was out of
the question. In spite, however, of its worn condition, it, with its fellow, was
continued in use until the end of 1855. The two-penny plate arrived on December
7th, 1855, by the ship “ William Prowse,” and the one penny and three-penny
plates, with colours, &c., about the same date by the “ Prince of Wales.” The
one penny and two-penny were gazetted on January 12th, 1856, to come into use
immediately, but the three-penny was not gazetted until October 10th, 1856.


As these plates came into use, the old plates were destroyed—by the
subjects being planed off, instead of being broken up —in the presence of a Board
appointed for the purpose. This is probably what Mr. Chapman remembers
doing with the grindstone. The two-penny continued in use until March 25th,
1862; the one penny until March 7th, 1864; the three-penny is still in use after
thirty-four years’ service.
These plates were prepared in England by Perkins, Bacon, & Co., and the
stamps were printed in the Colony from them. A statement occurs in “ Oceania ”
to the effect that “ some of the later editions of this type have, no doubt, judging
from the blotched impressions, been printed in the Colony.” As I have just
stated, the whole of the impressions were printed in the Colony, and the reason
for the blotched impressions of the later editions was, that the plates of the one
penny and two-penny became very much worn.


VI. —THE FIVE-SHILLING STAMP.
UUH N January 29th, 1859, the Manager of the Union Bank of Australia
wrote to the Postmaster-General respecting the inconvenience caused
hy haying to use stamps of small value in payment of packets bearing
a large amount of postage. In a letter to the Colonial Secretary, dated
February 10th, 1859, the Postmaster-General states, that “ the fear of
forgery has hitherto prevented stamps of a higher value being issued; but I
think the time has arrived, in which the experiment might be made, by issuing a
stamp of the value of 55., which stamp can be called in, should the experiment
not succeed.” He then asks for permission to submit a design for a postage
stamp of the value of ss. The Colonial Secretary approved, on February 10th,
of the design being submitted. On this letter is a minute asking when Mr.
Levinge can submit a design. Mr. Levinge prepared his designs, five in
number—four were for the 55., and one for a 10s. stamp. Each of these
represented the Queen wearing a crown of a somewhat different shape; but the
“ Southern Cross” with the “Waratah,” were common to all. The Colonial
Secretary’s approval of the design was given on April 12th. Mr. Levinge sug-
gested that the stamps should be “ either engraved on plates or sunk on dies, to
produce medallion or cameo like impressions.” He further hopes that “care
may be taken that the approved design is faithfully carried out, and not
mutilated, as was the case with the designs for Is. and 6d. stamps, which I
furnished in 1852.” The Postmaster-General then recommended to the Colonial
Secretary “ that the Government agent in London be instructed to apply to
Messrs. Perkins and Bacon to carry out the order, and that they be directed to
employ the very best steel or copper-plate engraver in London for the purpose,
with orders that his work shall be elaborate enough to defy forgery.” On
May 20th, the Colonial Secretary intimated to the Postmaster-General that the
plate for the Five Shillings Postage Stamps had been ordered through the agents
of the Colony, by the last mail.


The plate arrived in due course, and under a Gazette notice of March 14th,
18G1, the stamps were to issue on April Ist. Such is the official history of the
issue of this stamp. On examining the design, we find that it follows very
closely that submitted by Mr. Levinge, and approved of. The “ Southern Cross”
is there; but the “Waratah” has changed into a “ Rose” ! From the records in
the Government Printing Office, I find that on April 2nd, 1861, the first issue of
600 of these stamps took place, and that they were all perforated. They were
never issued in an imperforate state. They were printed on specially prepared
white wove paper, with the water-mark ss. They continued in use until the
Centennial issue displaced them. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to add that the
stamps were printed at the Government Printing Office, Sydney, and not in
London.


VII.—THE SERIES FROM 1862 TO 1876.
«HE Two-pence was the first of this series to be issued. As we have
seen all through, the demand for the Two-penny Stamps, was greater
than for those of any other value. In consequence of this, the wear of the
v | plates was more rapid, and the plates required renewing more frequently.
From the following Gazette notice, it will be seen that the issue took
place immediately after March 25th, 1862 :
The Treasury, New South Wales,
25 March, 1862.
Postage Stamps.
It is hereby notified, that a Plate for Two-penny Postage Stamps, with an improved
design, has been obtained from England.
Stamps with the new design will be immediately issued.
E. C. WEEKES.
The die was engraved by De la Rue & Co., and from it they prepared
the electrotype plate. This was sent out to the Colony, and the stamps were
printed from it in the Government Printing Office. This plate, in course of
time, wore out, and was twice reproduced in the above office, the original die
having been sent out. The stamps were printed on various kinds of paper,
either with or without water-marks. In the latter end of 1886, the supply of
the ordinary “ Crown N.S.W.” paper became exhausted, and recourse was had
to the “ Stamp Duty Paper,” with water-mark “N.5.W.,” extending over two
stamps. There were several issues on this paper.
The One Penny was the next to be issued. The following is the Gazette
notice, showing the date on which it was issued: —
The Treasury, New South Wales,-
7 March, 1864.
Postage Stamps.
A Plate for Penny Postage Stamps having been obtained from England, notice is
hereby given, that stamps printed therefrom will be issued after the Ist of April next.
GEOFFREY EAGAR.


The same remarks apply, as regards engraving of the die, preparation of
the plates, reproduction, and varieties of paper used. There is only one remark
that may be made with reference to the plate. When this arrived in the Colony,
the first impressions were struck in a red, composed largely of vermilion. The
effect of the mercury in this, on the copper of the plate, soon became apparent.
At first it was thought that the plate had been sent out in a defective state, but
subsequently, the real cause was discovered, and, for the vermilion, a vegetable
red was substituted.
The Four-penny and Ten-penny Stamps were both issued on the same
day.
The Ti’easury, New South Wales,
18 September, 1867.
Postage Stamps.
Notice is hereby given, that Postage Stamps of the value of Four-pence and Ten-pence,
respectively, will be ready for issue to the public on and after the 21st instant.
GEOFFREY EAGAR.
The dies were engraved and the plates prepared in England by De la
Rue & Co., but the stamps were printed in the Colony. The Postal Act, 31
Victoria, No. 4, reduced the registration fee on letters from 6d. to 4d., and to
meet this a four-penny stamp was required. The same Act provided for the
prepayment to destination of correspondence for the continent of Europe without
the necessity of such correspondence passing through the United Kingdom, and
for this service the Ten-penny stamp was provided.
The Nine-penny Stamp.—As early as March 24th, 1862, a proposition was
made to obtain a die for printing 9d. stamps, but nothing came of it. On March
20th, 1871, the Postal authorities wrote to the Government Printer “that a 9d.
postage stamp would be a great boon to the New South Wales public, as it would
cover the single rate of postage via Marseilles,” as the lOd. stamp was now useless,
and suggesting that it might be possible to so alter that plate as to avoid the
expense of new plates. Mr. Richards, the Government Printer, did not think it
was possible to alter the ten-penny plate, and enclosed indents for a nine-penny
plate. It was then pointed out that, as there were already 3d., 4d., 5d., and 6d.
stamps in the Colony, no difficulty could arise in the prepayment by stamps of
letters bearing 9d. postage, and that consequently it was not necessary to incur
that expense at present. On July 13th the matter was reconsidered, “as dis-
satisfaction is felt at the absence of a 9d. stamp for the postage via Brindisi,”
and in a minute it was suggested that “ the present lOd. stamp might be made
available as a 9d. one by printing across it the words f nine pence.’ This course
K


has been adopted in Victoria, South Australia, and other places.” This suggestion
was carried out, and on October sth it was reported that the 9d. stamp was ready
for issue. It was printed in burnt-sienna, and the surcharge of “nine pence” in
black was placed over the original value.
The Six-penny Stamp was issued on January Ist, 1872. The following
Gazette notice, in addition to gazetting the stamp, also gives a description of it:—
General Post Office,
Sydney, 21 December, 1871.
New Sixpence Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the Ist January next, a New Postage Stamp,
described below, of the value of Sixpence, will be issued in substitution for the one now
current. Until, however, the supply of the present Sixpence Stamp becomes exhausted,
such stamp may be used in payment of postage.
JOSEPH DOCKER.
Description of New Sixpence Stamp.
Profile of Queen Victoria, with diadem to the left, on tinted ground, in oval
hand, on which is inscribed in white letters “ New South Wales Postage, Sixpence,”
within hexagonal frame and border-lines, the outer spaces filled in with fine white net-
work. Printed in violet. 120 stamps in the sheet. Water-mark, a crown and “N.S.W.”
one hundred and twenty times repeated on each sheet.
The die for this stamp was engraved by De la Rue & Co., but the plate
was prepared in the Colony. As this was the first time that this had been done,
the plate was exhibited for some days in the General Post Office. I may here
state that there is no trace among the Records of the Post Office of the papers
relating to the issue of the 2d., Id., 4d., 10d., and 6d., of this series.


VIII.—THE ONE SHILLING STAMP.
rjJflf p following paper of mine was read at the meeting of the Philatelic
Society of London on November 30th, 1888.
l/fl Recently, by the courtesy of the postal authorities, I was permitted
to examine, and make extracts from, the whole of the papers relating to
the issue of the One Shilling Stamp of 1876, as well as to exhibit the sheets
printed in green to the members of the Philatelic Society of Australia. The
result will be found embodied in the following short paper.
The first information of importance is a letter addressed by the Under-
secretary for Finance and Trade to the Secretary, General Post Office:—
The Treasury, New South Wales,
Sii’j Sydney, 24 January, 1876.
I have the honor, by desire of the Minister acting for the Colonial Treasurer,
to advise you of the arrival from London of the die and electroplate required for the issue
of the new One Shilling Postage Stamps ; and I am to enclose two proof-sheets of the stamp
(120 in each).
Awaiting the necessary instructions to be issued to the Government Printer in this
matter,
I have, &c.,
G. EAGAR.
On this appears the following minutes :
Submitted. Ido not know why the new stamp was ordered. I prefer the design
and colour of the present one.—S.H.L., 28-1-76.
The Government Printer informs me that the new stamp was ordered because the
plate of the present one is much worn.—S.H.L., 4-2-76.
Let the necessary notice be issued.—l B-2-76.
The enclosures were two proof-sheets in green. One, in light green on
stout white wove paper without water-mark. At the foot in writing is “De la
Rue’s proof. Forwarded to Treasury, 19 January, 1876.—T.R.” The other is
printed in almost a deep olive-green, and has the following writing on the right
side: “G.P.O. Proof. Forwarded to Treasury, 19-1-76. —T.R.” This one is on
Crown N.&.W. paper. Both are imperforate and without gum.
Attached to this letter is a description of the stamp, drawn up by Mr. G.
Kellick, of the Government Printing Office, on February 24th,


In accordance with the minute of Mr. J. F. Burns, the Postmaster-General,
the following notice was inserted in the Government Gazette of March 3rd :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 28 February, 1876.
New One Shilling Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the Ist April next, a new postage stamp,
described below, of the value of One Shilling, will be issued in substitution for the one now
current. Until, however, the supply of the present One Shilling Stamp becomes exhausted,
such stamp may be used in payment of Postage.
Description of New One Shilling Stamp.
Profile of Queen Victoria to left on plain tinted ground, enclosed in solid band,
parallel at sides, arch at top, inverted arch at bottom, on which is inscribed, in white block
letters, “ New South Wales ” at top, “ One Shilling ” at bottom, and “Postage” on each
side, outer space filled in with white spray on solid ground. Colour, green. 120 stamps
on a sheet. Water-mark, a Crown, and the letters “N.S.W.”
J. F. BURNS.
In consequence of this notice, objections appear to have been taken to the
change of colour, which would equally apply to the change in the One Penny
Centennial, which has recently been issued.
Memo.— As complications and grumblings are sure to arise with the public on account of
the new One Shilling Stamp, and as the Government Printer has not yet printed any, I
would urge the desirability of retaining the original colour (red). I think it a great
mistake to alter the colour of any stamp. We have the sd. stamp green, and same design
as present Is., and this will cause confusion.
E. T. SAYERS,
The Secretary, itc. Cashier, G.P.0., 14-3-76.
I quite concur in Mr. Sayers’ remarks, and complained to Mr. Richards of the
colour as soon as I saw the stamps. I think the orders for new stamps should go from
this Department, and we should appi’ove both of the design and colour. The Treasury
might be informed of the objections to the new stamp, and asked at whose request it was
ordered, and who selected the colour and design.—S.H.L., 15-3-76.
Approved.—J.F.B., 18-3-76.
The following letters are the result of this minute :
The Treasury, New South Wales,
Sir, Sydney, 11 May, 1876.
With reference to your letters of the 20th March and 26th April, respecting
the new One Shilling Postage Stamp, I have the honor, by desire of the Colonial Treasurer,
to hand you enclosed herewith, for the information of the Postmaster-General, a copy of
a report from the Inspector of Postage Stamps. I have, &c.,
G. EAGAR.
The Secretary, Post Office Department.
Submitted.—S. H.L., 12-5-76.
Black-coloured stamps approved.—J.F.B., 17-3-76.
Prepare an amended notice and inform Treasury.—S.H.L., 17-5-76,
Treasury.—N.C.O’N., 19-5-76,


[Copy.]
Government Printing Office,
bir ’ nr- , c Sydney, 8 May, 1876.
With reference to the letter addressed to yon by the Secretary to the General
Post Office, dated 23rd March last, on the subject of the issue of the new One Shilling
Stamp, recently received from England, and requesting information as to the ordering of
the plate, and the selection of the colour and design of the stamp, I do myself the honor
to inform you that the ordering of a new plate became necessary, in consequence of the
old one (which was injured some years ago by undue heating) having become so worn as
to be almost impossible to print from. The selection of the design and colour of the stamp
was left to Messrs. De la Kue, to whom the order for the die and plate was intrusted.
I have, &c.,
THOS. RICHARDS,
Inspector of Stamps,
The colour of the One Shilling Stamp has been changed, with the concurrence
of the Postmaster-General, from green to black.
The notice which appeared, as a result of the minute of the Postmaster-
General, was as follows :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 19 May, 1876.
New One Shilling Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that the colour of the new postage stamp of the value of One
Shilling, described in the departmental notice dated the 28th February last, will be black
instead of green.
J. F. BURNS.
In the Report of the Postmaster-General for 1876 this passage occurs :
On the Ist April a new postage stamp of the value of One Shilling was issued in
substitution for the one previously current.
Then follows a description of the stamp, as taken from the Gazette notice,
finishing up with this paragraph:
The colour of the stamp was green when first issued ; a few weeks afterwards
however, it was altered to black.
This rea l with the Gazette notices naturally leads one to suppose that it
had been issued in green, and such was my impression, until I had the oppor-
tunity of examining the whole of the papers. Subsequently I saw Mr. Richards,
the late Government Printer, and he stated most positively that, with the
exception of the one proof-sheet, it was never printed in green.


IX.—FISCAL STAMPS SURCHARGED “POSTAGE.”
I HE system of prepayment of telegrams by postage stamps was intro-
f dnced on October Ist, 1885, but being found to be open to objection,
' it was abolished, and the cash system reverted to on April Ist, 1886.
Y ' Some years ago a proposal, somewhat similar in its nature, was adopted ;
but it seems that part of the system did not meet with popular approval,
and consequently the plan of prepaying by stamps fell into disuse. In that case
a special set of telegraphic stamps was issued, and that involved the necessity of
every business man providing himself with at least two sets of stamps —one for
postal purposes and one for telegrams. It is believed that the necessity for
doing this practically led to the plan being abandoned. On the introduction of
the system of prepayment of telegrams by postage stamps, it was deemed neces-
sary to provide stamps of a higher denomination than those previously in use,
and, accordingly, authority was obtained for the issue of a Ten-shilling and a
One Pound Stamp. These were approved of on October 14th, and gazetted on
November 23rd, 1885.
The official description of them is as follows :
Profile of Queen Victoria to left with diadem on tinted background, enclosed in
circle, containing the words “New South Wales” above and “Stamp Duty” underneath
in white letters on oblong figured field, with “ L. I. O. O.” at top, and “One Pound” at
bottom, the whole enclosed by border lines attached to centre at sides. The word
“ Postage ” in black erased letters printed over “ Stamp Duty.” Colour, centre and
border lines violet, with carmine field. Value, £l.
Similar to foregoing, with scroll field, 10s.
It appears that, in addition to these, a stamp of the value of ss. had also
been prepared, and one actually passed through the post on November 18th. On
reference to the Inspector of Stamps, it was found that the old Five-shilling
postage stamp plate, being of steel, would not stand the extra amount of work
thrown upon it, and was then showing signs of wear. Under these circumstances,
the Inspector made use of the stamp duty electro-plate of the ss. value, as by it
he could print ten times the number possible from the steel plate. He therefore


recommended that authority be given to use this surcharged duty stamp, in
place of the ordinary postage stamp. This authority was given on December 15th,
1885, and the following notice was inserted in the Gazette :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 22 December, 1885.
In accordance with the provisions of the 16th section of the Postage Act, His Excellency
the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, has approved of the issue of a
new “ Five-shilling ” Postage Stamp of the following description :
Profile of Queen Victoria to left with diadem on tinted background, enclosed in
circle, containing the words “New South Wales” above and “Stamp Duty” underneath
in white letters on oblong figured field, with “ 55.” at top and “ five shillings ” at bottom ;
the whole enclosed by border lines attached to centre at sides. The word “ Postage ”in
black erased letters printed over “Stamp Duty.” Colour, centre and border lines violet,
with green diaper field. Value, ss.
The new “ Ten-shilling ” and “ One Pound ” postage stamps, referred to in
notification dated 3rd ultimo, are of a similar description, with the exception that the
former has a scroll and the latter a carmine field.
JOHN SEE.


X.—THE REGISTRATION STAMP.
1853.—Registered : Laureated head in lettered oval, broken each side by spirals, “New
South Wales,—Registered” ;no value. Bi-col.; imp. oval; 50 types to copper-plate.
UCH is the description given by Pemberton in 1878 in his Hand-book.
Now, let us try and trace what authority Pemberton had for his state-
merits, for he was generally very correct in every detail. If we turn
to the Report of the Postmaster-General for 1867 we find a “ Description
of New South Wales Postage Stamps” (a.d. 1838 to 1867),above which
appears the following;—“As it may be of some interest to postage stamp collectors
and others, I attach a description (compiled by Thos. Richards, Esq., the Inspector
of Stamps) of all the postage stamps which have been issued in this Colony up to
the present time. Passing over such slight matters, in this description, as green
two-penny, and brown and pink three-penny, Sydney views, with forty stamps on
each plate, we come to :
1853. Profile of Queen Victoria to left, in oval border, containing the words
« New South Wales ” at top, separated by scroll-work from the word “ Registered ” at
bottom. Printed in two colours; red centre, with blue border ; yellow centre, with blue
border. Value (6d.) not denoted. Steel; fifty stamps on each plate.
It appears that Pemberton must have known of this precious document,
though he did not accept the statement that the plate was of steel. The Philatelic
Society of London, in their recent work on “ The Postage Stamps of Oceania,”
appear to have taken their description partly from Pemberton and partly from
Richards; but in the presence of such a conflict of evidence they have thought
it better to simply state that the plate was “ engraved on metal.”
Now, let us see which of these is correct. Turning to the second volume
of the Government Gazette for 1855, we find the following notice :
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
„ . , , r .. Sydney, 21 November, 1855.
Registered Letters. J J
It being considered expedient to provide for the use of the public a distinctive Registry
Stamp, His Excellency the Governor-General directs it to be notified that, in pursuance
of the’lsth and 20th clauses of the Act of the Governor and Council, 15th Victoria,
No. 12, intituled “An Act to consolidate and amend the law for Conveyance and Postage
of Letters,” a plate has been obtained for these stamps.


Stamps for the purpose above-mentioned, 6d. each, will therefore be procurable
at the General and all other Post Offices, on and after the Ist January next. As this
stamp will be indispensable to registration, as well as inadmissible for ordinary postage, the
particular attention of parties in the habit of registering letters is requested to this notice.
By His Excellency’s Command,
C. D. RIDDELL.
From the Report of the Postmaster-General for 1856, we find that the
stamp actually came into use in that year. The following is the exact quotation :
New plates have been introduced during the year. One of these, the Five-penny
Stamp, was intended to be useful in the country districts, as including the united inland
and ship postage charge. The other stamp is that called the Registry Stamp, which is
exclusively used to represent the fee for registration, and has been found extremely useful.
It is the only stamp in which there are two colours ; and catching the eye readily, the
circumstance of a registered letter being loose or mixed up with other letters is readily
seen and rectified. The use of the stamp, too, as not being available for any other purpose,
has to a very great extent prevented parties posting and marking, as registered, letters
not duly entered as such, and for which they had not obtained receipts. The plate for
the Registry Stamp was manufactured in this Colony.
What authority is there for this last statement?
Let me quote a letter, a copy of which has been courteously supplied to
me by the Secretary to the Post Office :
(No. 72.) The Colonial Secretary to The Postmaster-General,
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sir, Sydney, 23 June, 1855.
In reply to your letter (55-5,606) of the 16th instant, I am directed to inform
you this His Excellency the Governor-General approves of the designs for a stamp for
registered letters therein submitted, and of the acceptance of Mr. Carmichael’s tender for
the execution of the plates. I have, &c,,
W. ELYARD
(For the Colonial Secretary).
Copy of lender. 23 May> mr> .
I, John Carmichael, engraver, hereby agree to engrave two steel plates for printing
backed registered stamps, containing fifty labels, of a design approved by His Excellency
the Governor-General, and to complete in a workmanlike manner and deliver the same in
four months from the date of receiving the order, for the sum of £B7 10s. I further
agree that the said plates shall be subject to the approval of the Postmaster-General and
Inspector of Stamps, as regards their execution, and to submit to a deduction, from the
price agreed upon, of £2 for each week the plates are detained after the first fortnight
beyond the specified period of four months.
Witness— F. W. Hill.
JOHN CARMICHAEL
Signed 23 May, 1855.
From these documents we obtain the information that our old friend.
Carmichael, engraved the plates, and that the contract was signed on May 23rd,
1855. Four months from this date will give September 23rd, and as Carmichael
was always behindhand with the former plates he had engraved, we may suppose
on this occasion he fully availed himself of the fortnight allowed beyond that
L


date. This brings us to October 7th, by which time the plates were doubtless
completed and handed over, so that they would be in good time for the issue on
January Ist, 1856.
As to the colours in which the stamp was printed, there is no doubt that
it was intended to use red for the centre and blue for the outer band, but from
time to time we find a variety of shades from red through orange to an olive
yellow. What was the reason of this ? Let us look for a moment at the large
square six-penny, and note the changes of colour in that stamp —sage green, pale
brown, umber, blue grey, lilac grey, lilac, mauve, and violet. Surely there was
some reason for this. The two stamps were in use at the same time, and were
printed by the same hands. The explanation appears to be, that the official who
prepared the colours for printing was colour-blind . The stamps were printed on
white wove paper, at first on unwater-marked paper, but about 1862 on paper
water-marked with a large 6. They were perforated also at the same time as
the other stamps, viz., in 1860. The perforations used were, in 1860, 12 and 13.
I have an orange uuwater-marked, perforated 13. In 1862 the perforation
appears to have been uniformly 13. Many of the perforated stamps appear to
have been printed on a paper with a bluish-glazed surface, but on looking closely
at the specimens it is seen that the colour of the paper arises from the plate not
having been properly cleaned. Now we come to the last point of importance.
How long did the plates remain in use ? Referring again to the Government
Gazette , in the second volume for 1867, we find the following notice;—
General Post Office,
Sydney, 24 December, 1867.
Post Office Registration Stamp.
Notice is hereby given, that the Registration Stamp now in use will become obsolete on
the Ist January next, the date of the reduction of the registration fee from 6d. to 4d.,
and that from the above date the registration fee upon letters, &c., must be paid by
ordinary postage stamps. All persons who have Registration Stamps in their possession
can have them exchanged for other postage stamps on application at any Post Office in
the Colony up to March 31st, 1868.
J. DOCKER.
The following extract from the Report of the Postmaster-General for 1868
completes all that we require to know with regard to this stamp :
The new Postal Act, 31 Victoria, No. 4, which was passed towards the end of the
year 1867, enabled several important improvements in the postal service of this Colony to
be introduced during the year 1868. Amongst the advantages which have already been
gained by the new Act, the following may be mentioned, viz. : the
reduction of the registration fee on letters from 6d. to 4d., &c.
Several other points might be dealt with, but I have given enough infor-
mation to clear up all debatable points.
An illustration of an entire sheet of these stamps is given on Plate XIII.


XI.—OFFICIAL STAMPS.
ear a s P ec^ description of Postage Stamps was introduced
piP for use in the various Government Departments. The following is the
Gazette notice :
7|u^
"yi General Post Office,
Sydney, 15 December, 1879.
His Excellency the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, has been pleased
to approve of the introduction of a special description of Postage Stamps for use by the
various Government Departments. These stamps—which are distinguishable by the
letters “ 0.5.” printed thereon in black—ai’e only available for official correspondence, and
letters having Postage Stamps of this character affixed thereto are liable to be intercepted
by the Post Office, unless the envelopes bear the endorsement “ 0.H.M.5.,” with the
name of the Department from which they are sent in the corner, or, in the case of letters
addressed to a Department, the name of the sender written in the corner. Under no
pretext whatever will these stamps be purchased by or exchanged for other postage
stamps at the Post Office.
SAUL SAMUEL.
In addition to this the accompanying Circular was issued to the individual
Departments :
Circular. General Post Office,
Sydney, 17 December, 1879.
It has been determined to introduce a special description of Postage Stamps for use in the
Public Service.
These stamps are the usual ones of the several denominations, but each stamp will
be found marked with the letters O.S. (on Service).
The intention is, that stamps so marked, and no other, shall be used by the
various public officials throughout the Colony in stamping letters forwarded by them on
Public Service.
It has been decided that all correspondence bearing the endorsement 0.H.M.5.,
with the name of the Department (or Branch thereof) it is sent from in the corner, or, in
the case of letters addressed io a Department, having the name of the sender written in
the corner, shall be allowed to pass as duly prepaid letters, provided they are fully stamped
with stamps of the abovenamed description. Under no circumstances whatever can
letters, &c., stamped with these postage stamps be allowed to pass unless endorsed as above
indicated. Any letters stamped otherwise than in accordance with the foregoing
directions must be sent to the Dead Letter Office as unstamped letters.


Under no pretext whatever must postage stamps of the character herein specified he
supplied to Postmasters, or be sold by Postmasters, or be purchased back from the public,
or be changed for stamps of other denominations; in fact, it is to be fully understood by
all persons employed in the Postal Department that these stamps are only available for
bond fide official correspondence, posted in conformity with the above regulations. Public
officers in the country will not be able to procure “0.5.” stamps from the Country Post-
masters, but can obtain them from the Head of their Department in Sydney, to whom
they will be supplied on requisition to this Office.
The Postmaster-General enjoins on all postal officials a strict observance of the
foregoing regulations.
S. H. LAMBTON,
Secretary,
There is considerable doubt as to which stamps were so surcharged, but I
think the following will be found to be a correct list:—ld., 2d., 3d., 4d., 6d., Bd.,
Is., ss. These were all surcharged in black, except the Is., which had.the O.S.
in red. In consequence of the difficulty of supplying all the Departments at
once, some sheets were issued which had been experimentally surcharged in red.
These were, I believe, the 2d., 3d., 5d., and Bd. Why the sd. was issued sur-
charged in red I am unable to say, as it was never issued with the black
surcharge.


XII.—ENVELOPES.
S||Hp| February 16th, 1855, J. C. Thornthwaite submitted to Mr. Raymond
an estimate for dies for stamping envelopes with the head—two
dies complete for £2O. On March 14th, 1855, the Inspector of Stamps
wrote to the Colonial Secretary respecting the Stamped Envelopes. On
this, the latter made a minute, authorising the issue of the One Penny
and Two-penny Envelopes, but “ until water-marked paper is obtained from
England, it would not perhaps be advisable to issue envelopes of a higher value
than those mentioned, so that no temptation to forgery may exist.”
On April sth, Major Christie, Postmaster-General, wrote to the Colonial
Secretary, recommending that Thornthwaite’s tender be accepted for dies for One
Penny and Two-penny Envelopes, paper to be obtained from England specially
water-marked. On April 13th, the Colonial Secretary wrote to the Inspector of
Stamps, recommending the issue of One Penny and Two-penny Envelopes; but to
stand over until proper water-marked paper for the envelopes be obtained from
England. On June 11th, the Inspector of Stamps wrote to the Colonial Secretary,
enclosing designs and estimate of probable cost of machinery and paper for the
manufactuie of stamped envelopes. On June 30th, the Colonial Secretary wrote
to the Inspector of Stamps, informing him that the Govern or-General had
approved the designs submitted for One Penny, Two-penny, Sixpenny, and One
Shilling stamped envelopes. On July ] 7th R. P. Raymond wrote to the Colonial
Secretary, enclosing duplicate and triplicate copies of designs and estimates for the
said envelopes. The dies were to be embossed, the envelopes for each description
of stamp to have the water-mark on the right hand upper corner, indicating, in
words, the value of the stamp to be embossed on it. On July 25th, the Colonial
Secretary informed the Inspector of Stamps that a requisition had been forwarded to
England for machinery, dies, and paper for the manufacture of stamped envelopes.
These dies are now in the Government Printing Office, and copies of the
envelopes may be seen in the very best collections. The One Penny die was
subsequently used for the One Penny Wrapper of 1864. The Two-penny die was
used for Registered Envelopes, embossed in pairs, in blue, on the flap. This is


illustrated in Plate VII, fig. g. The design for the Six-penny was that of the
large square Six-penny, and for the One Shilling that of the large square One
Shilling. It appears likely that Thornthwaite’s tender was not accepted; but
that all the dies were obtained from England.
On January Ist, 1870, One Penny Stamped Envelopes were issued. The
arrangements for the issue of Two-penny Stamped Envelopes were not completed
until September, 1881, on the 2nd of which month they were issued to the
public. The dies for these were electrotypes from the original dies engraved by
De la Rue & Co. The system of impressing One Penny and Two-penny Stamps
on envelopes, supplied by the public for the purpose, under certain regulations,
also came into operation in September, 1881.
Registration Envelopes.—For the better security of the contents of
registered letters, a special description of envelope was introduced in March,
1880. The following is the Gazette notice:—
General Post Office,
Sydney, 6 March, 1880.
His Excellency the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, having been
pleased to approve of the introduction of Stamped Registered Letter Envelopes, it is
hereby notified for general information that such envelopes can hereafter be purchased by
the public at 4d. each. Postmasters and licensed stamp vendors will be supplied with the
envelopes in packets of thirty at the usual discount.
It should be borne in mind that the impressed stamp which the envelope bears
represents the registration fee only (4d.), and that the postage must be prepaid by affixing
the necessary stamps.
A letter enclosed in one of these envelopes must not be dropped into a letter-box, but
must be given to an officer of the Post Office to be registered, and a receipt obtained for it.
SAUL SAMUEL.
It may be mentioned here, that the die for the stamp to be used on these
envelopes was. not ready on the above date; it was, therefore, decided to issue
the provisional envelope mentioned above, with the Two-penny die, twice
embossed on the flap, in blue. They were only in use for a very short time, and,
when the permanent issue was ready, the whole of the provisional copies on hand
were returned to the Government Printing Office, and there destroyed.
Official Envelopes. —On August 22nd, 1883, the ordinary One Penny and
Two-penny Stamped Envelopes were issued for use by the various Government
Departments, surcharged O.S, in black.
On January Ist, 1885, a new die was prepared for One Penny
O.S. Envelopes,for use by the Department of Public Instruction.
In this the ornaments in the spandrels were replaced by the letters
O.S. in block letters.


XIII.—NEWSPAPER WRAPPERS.
-v Cf
dS URING 1864 an Act was passed (27 Vic., No. 7), imposing on and after
a c^iar l? e Id* each upon all newspapers posted within the
Colony. To meet this charge, wrappers were prepared, bearing a One
-T Penny Stamp. The die for this stamp is mentioned under “ Envelopes.”
The following is the Gazette notice :
The Treasury, New South Wales,
14 March, 1864.
Notice.
On and after the Ist April next, Newspapers posted within, or transmitted through the
Post within, the Colony, will not be forwarded unless prepaid by Id. stamp.
„ a PP ers bearing a Stamp of that value can be obtained at the General Post
Othce, and from Licensed Vendors.
GEOFFREY EAGAR.
Ihis wrapper did not long remain in use, probably on account of tbe difficulty of
embossing sucli a large number as were required. The new One Penny Stamp had
come into use on the Ist April, so, early in the following year, an electrotype from
that die was prepared, and came into use in March, 1865. The following is the
notice :
The Treasury, New South Wales,
28 February, 1865.
Postage Stamps.
A new plate having been provided for the Newspaper Postage Wrappers, of the same
design as the One Penny Letter Stamp now in use : Notice is hereby given that Stamped
VV lappers, printed therefrom, will be issued immediately.
T. W. SMART.
llicse last continued in use until displaced by the Centennial issue.
Ihe Newspaper Postage Abolition Act came into force on January Ist, 1874.


XIV.—POST CARDS.
fHE introduction, on October Ist, 1875, of the Postal Card system,
provided facilities for postal communication not previously afforded.
During 1875 no less a number than 128,786 Post Cards were issued.
Between the date of the first issue (the design for which was furnished
by Mr. Richards) and the issue of the Centennial series, several slight
variations from the original design were made.
Reply Post Cards. —That is double cards, each half of which has a penny
stamp impressed thereon, one-half being intended for use by the sender and the
other by the addressee in transmitting a reply, were gazetted on January 12th,
1883, but the first issue took place on January sth.
Official Post Cards. —Bearing a one penny stamp, in which the ornaments
in the spandrels were replaced by the letters 0.5., were issued for the use of
the various Departments in May, 1885. Others had previously been in use with
the stamp surcharged O.S. in black across the top.


XV.—THE CENTENNIAL SERIES.
USTRALIA, nationally speaking, completed lier hundredth year on
yIIIII January 26th, 1888. This event was celebrated in New South Wales by
the unveiling of the Queen’s Statue, the dedication of the Centennial
Park, a State banquet, illuminations, and so forth. To some Philatelists,
however, it appeared that a very appropriate method of celebrating it
would be by the issue of certain new stamps. To Mr. Thomas Pugh belongs the
honor of first suggesting this. The suggestion was warmly taken up by the
Philatelic Society of Australia, after certain preliminary work had been done by
Mr. Pugh and the author of this paper. At a meeting of the Society, held on
August 2nd, 1887, a committee was appointed, consisting of the Venerable Arch-
deacon King, Dr. Houison, and Messrs. Pugh and Hagen, to carry the matter out.
They waited on the Premier on the August sth, to recommend that an issue of
new stamps should form an item in the programme for the celebration of the
centenary of the Colony. Sir Henry Parkes at once fell in with the proposal, and
informed the deputation that he would represent what they had said to the other
members of the Government. The Cabinet met on the same afternoon, considered
the proposal, and decided to have enquiry made as to the cost of new dies.
This took some little time, but eventually resulted in the following notice
appearing in the Government Gazette :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 15 November, 1887.
Designs for New Postage Stamps.
Designs will be received at this office until noon on Tuesday, the 6th December, for
eight new Postage Stamps, intended to be commemorative of the One Hundredth
Anniversary of the foundation of the Colony.
The designs must be drawn in black and white, to a scale four times the size of
the present penny postage stamp. A distinct design will be required for each of the
following denominations, viz. :
One Penny. Eight-pence.
Two pence. One Shilling.
Four-pence. Five Shillings.
Sixpence. Twenty Shillings.

sign or motto, and the name and address of the Tenderer enclosed in a sealed cover
marked with the same sign or motto, to accompany the design, which cover will not be
opened until the selections have been made.
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.
The result of this notice was that 956 designs were sent in by about 250
competitors. The great majority of these were very crude, but some few were
not only well conceived, but admirably drawn. On December 12th, the whole of
the designs were submitted to the Committee of the Philatelic Society by the
Premier, in the Cabinet Council Room, and their opinion was given as to those
that were most suitable for the purpose. The final selection rested with the
Postmaster-General.
The following Gazette notice gives the list of prizes :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 6 January, 1888.
Designs for new Postage /Stamps.
It is hereby notified that premiums have been awarded for designs for new postage
stamps, as follow, viz.:—

The Postmaster-General reserves the right to use these designs in any way that
may be deemed expedient to utilise them, i.e., to substitute one denomination of stamp
for another, or to modify the design in any respect; and it should be understood that it
does not follow that the awarding of premiums necessarily implies that the designs shall
be used at all.
The successful designers will in a few days be specially informed when and on
what conditions they can obtain the amount of their prizes.
It is intended to publicly exhibit for a short while the whole of the designs that
have been sent in (unless any of the unsuccessful competitors intimate to this department
in writing, before the 12th instant, that they object to this being done), and due notice
will subsequently be given when designs will be returnable to their owners.
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.
As these vary somewhat from those eventually chosen, I shall take them
individually, and indicate briefly the subjects of the designs.
One Penny. —This design was adopted.
Two-pence. —A portrait of Lord Carrington, under an arch inscribed,
“ New South Wales Postage/’ supported by columns, bearing the words
“ Two-pence,” and resting on a basement having the words “ One Hundred
Years ” on its front.
Four-pence. —This design was adopted.
Fix-pence. —This design was adopted.
Eight-pence. —A medallion portrait of Her Majesty, imperially crowned,
flanked by groups of native roses, and resting on a scroll with the words, “ Hew
South Wales Postage,” immediately beneath which is a view of Sydney, and
‘ ‘ One Hundred Years,” on a ribbon-like label, at the foot of the whole, the value
in large letters “ Eight-pence,”


One Shilling. —A representation of the Statue of Captain Cook in Hyde
Park, Sydney, surrounded by native floral emblems under an arch, bearing the in-
scription “ One Hundred Years” —“ New South Wales Postage ” —“ One Shilling.
Five Shillings. —This design was adopted.
Twenty Shillings. —This design was adopted.
It is unnecessary to describe the second prize designs, as not one of them
was eventually adopted. The suggestion was thrown out, that the engraving of
the designs should be entrusted to some firm of eminence, either in England or
America, but it was decided that the engraving and printing should be done in
the Government Printing Office, under the immediate supervision of Mr. Charles
Potter, the Government Printer and Inspector of Stamps. The engraving was
performed by Mr. William Bell. The process was as follows ; —A block of steel
was prepared of the required size ;on this the design was engraved. It was then
hardened, and the requisite number of impressions were made by means of this
die on blocks of lead. These, after the necessary trimming, were fixed together
in the form and shape the plate was eventually to assume, and this was then
placed in the electrotyping bath and a copy made, which was backed up and pre-
pared for printing from. The first issue was of the Twenty Shilling Stamp, and the
following is the Gazette notice giving a description of it and the date of issue ;
General Post Office,
Sydney, 26 April, 1888.
Centenary of the Colony — New Issue of Postage Stamp.
It is notified that, on and after the Ist May next, a new Postage Stamp described
below, of the value of Twenty Shillings, will be issued in substitution for the one now
current. Until, however, the supply of the present Twenty Shilling Stamp becomes
exhausted such stamp may be used.
Description of New Twenty Shilling Stamp.
The stamp is printed in light blue. It represents the Governors of New South
Wales in the respective years 1788 and 1888, viz. : —Captain Phillip and Lord Carrington.
They appear as if on two coins, one partially hidden behind the other. The coin in the
front bears the portrait of Lord Carrington ; it is clearly and
strongly defined, and near its edge are printed the words Twenty
Shillings (the value of the stamp) and the figures 1888. The second
coin bears the portrait of Captain Phillip and the figures 1788 ; it
is smaller than the other, as if far off, and is surrounded by clouds
to convey the idea of distance and space of time. Floating between
the coins, amongst the clouds, is a fluttering banner with the
words, “ One Hundred Years.” The spaces surrounding the coins
are filled in with the Australian ferns and Christmas bells (bland-
fordia nobilis), the latter being appropriately suggestive of ringing
in the glad Centennial time.
Until special paper can be procured, the stamp will be printed on that now used
for the present Five-shilling Stamp.
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.


As mentioned in the last paragraph of this notice, the stamp was first
printed on the old 5/- water-mark paper. The new paper, which is of the same
quality as that used for the rest of New South Wales issue, bears the water-mark,
20/- over N.S.W., in a circle. The diameter of the circle is seven-eighths of
an inch.
On the old five-shilling paper, which was of a brownish tint, the design
was not effective, but on the new paper, which is more highly milled, the design
is satisfactory.
Next in order of issue comes the One Penny stamp. The following is the
Gazette notice of the issue :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 29 June, 1888.
Centenary of the Colony.—New Issue of Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the 9th proximo, a new Postage Stamp, described
below, of the value of One Penny, will be issued in substitution for the one now current.
Until, however, the supply of the present One Penny Stamp becomes exhausted, such
stamp may be used.
Description of New One Penny Stamp.
Inside a circle is a view of Sydney, taken from Mossman’s Bay. Above
the circle rests an Imperial Crown, and around the circle are the words
“New South Wales Postage” and “One Hundred Years.” The
surrounding space is filled with Australian ferns, and the words “ One
Penny.” The stamp is printed in violet lake.
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.
The design was chosen as an historical contrast to the Original One
Penny Sydney View. It was printed on the ordinary Crown N.S.W. water-mark
paper, and from the fact that one-half of the plate was set in error, upside down,
it will be found that one-half of the water-marks are upside down also. In
consequence of the supply of this paper having run out on several occasions, the
value was printed on the “ Duty Paper,” with the water-mark, a large “ N.S.W.”
Immediately on the issue of this stamp a correspondence took place in
the newspapers, with reference to the colour. It was pointed out that the
colour adopted would lead to confusion with the then current sixpence, and
also that it was unwise to change a colour that had been identified with the
stamp since the first issue. The colour wished for was that subsequently chosen


for the sixpence, viz., rosine; but the Postmaster-General had made up his
mind that the colour should be violet-lake, and violet-lake it remained, it spite
of all the influence brought to bear upon him.
Next came the Two-pence. The prize design was here abandoned, and
one by Miss Devine substituted. The following is the Gazette notice :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 10 August, 1888.
Centenary of the Colony—New Issue of Postage Stamps.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the Ist proximo, a new Postage Stamp, described
below, of the value of Two-pence, will be used in substitution for the one now current.
Until, however, the supply of the present Two-penny Stamp becomes exhausted, such
stamp may be used.
Description of New Two-penny Stamp.
The stamp is printed in deep blue. The design represents an Emu
surrounded by a shaded oval band, on which the words “ One Hundred
Years ” and “ Two Pence ” are inscribed. The four corners bear the
words “New South Wales Postage,” with which are interwoven the
berries of the Lilly-pilly, the Corea or Native Fuchsia, and feathery
sprays of Wattle.
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.
The same remarks apply to this stamp, as to the One Penny, with reference
to water-mark, but in this case the plates were set properly, and any topsy turyey
printing could only occur.by accident. The stamp was also printed on the
“ Duty Paper,” at the same periods, and for the same cause, as the One penny.
The next to appear was the Four-pence. The Gazette notice is as
follows :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 29 September, 1888.
Centenary of the Colony.—New Issue of Postage Stamps.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the Bth proximo, a new Postage Stamp, described
below, of the value of Four-pence, will be issued in substitution for the one now current.
Until, however, the supply of the present Four-penny Stamp becomes exhausted, such
stamp may be used.
Description of New Four-penny Stamp.
The stamp is printed in chocolate-brown. The design consists of a
portrait of Captain Cook, surrounded by an oval band on which the
words “New South Wales Postage” are inscribed, within the oval the
words “ Captain Cook ” are printed. At the foot of the portrait is the
Australian Coat of Arms resting on a cross band, on which the words
“ Four Pence” are printed. The whole is fitted into a fancy square, the
top bar of which bears the words “ One Hundred Years.”
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.
Printed on Crown N.S.W. paper.


The next issue was that of the Sixpence, and the Gazette notice was as
follows :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 14 November, 1888.
Centenary of the Colony.—New Issue of Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the 26 th instant, a new Postage Stamp, described
below, of the value of Sixpence will be issued in substitution for the one now current)
Until, however, the supply of the present Sixpenny Stamp becomes exhausted, such
stamp may be used.
Description of New Sixpenny Stamp.
The colour of the stamp is rosine. The design consists of the Queen’s
head in the left hand upper corner, to the right of which are four stars
representing the Southern Cross ■ beneath these and on the right is the
New South Wales Coat of Arms surrounded by Australian flowers,
y i z - • the waratah, wattle blossoms, eucalyptus, ferns, and heath, and
surmounted by a small scroll bearing the words “One Hundred Years.”
I his small scroll is surmounted by a larger one running diagonally through
the centre of the design and bearing the words “ New South Wales Postage.” The value
of the stamp is denoted by the word “ Sixpence ” legibly inscribed on a broad bar at the
foot of the design.
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.
Printed on Crown H.S.W. paper.
The next to follow was the Eight-pence ; and here a change in the design
was made to one of a Lyre-bird, by Miss Devine. Appended is the Gazette
notice :—•
General Post Office,
Sydney, 4 January, 1889.
Centenary of the Colony—New Issue of Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the 17th instant, a new Postage Stamp, described
below, of the value of Eight-pence, will be issued in substitution for the one now current.
Until, however, the supply of the present Eight-penny Stamp becomes exhausted, such
stamp may be used.
Description of Hew Eight-penny Stamp.
The stamp is printed in plum colour. The design consists of a repre-
sentation of the Australian Lyre-bird in an oval, which occupies the centre
of the stamp. At the foot of the oval and within, on a white "round,
the words “One Hundred Years” are printed. The oval is surrounded
by native flowers, the waratah, and honeysuckle, and encircled at the top
by the words “Hew South Wales Postage.” The value of the stamp is
denoted by the words “ Eight Pence ” legibly inscribed on a broad bar
at the foot of the stamp.
CHARLES J. ROBERTS.
Printed on Crown N.S.W. paper.


Next in order was tlie One Sliilling. The design of this was taken from
a Kangaroo in the Museum, which was photographed, and the border filled in
with native flowers. The Gazette notice is as follows :
, General Post Office,
Sydney, 12 February, 1889.
Centenary of the Colony—New Issue of Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the 21st instant, a new Postage Stamp, described
below, of the value of One Shilling, will be issued in substitution for the one now
current. Until, however, the supply of the present One Shilling Stamp becomes
exhausted, such stamp may be used.
Description of New One Shilling Stamp.
The stamp is printed in purple brown. The design consists of a repre-
sentation of a kangaroo, surrounded by waratah, flannel, and other native
flowers and shrubs. A scroll above the design bears the words “ One
Hundred Years.” Along the left-hand edge of the stamp are printed the
words “New South,” and in a corresponding position on the right-hand
edge the words “Wales Postage.” The value is denoted by the words
“ One Shilling ” printed in large characters on a broad white band at
the foot of the stamp.

The last of the series to appear was the Five Shillings. The Gazette
notice is as follows :
General Post Office,
Sydney, 8 March, 1890.
Centenary of the Colony—New Issue of Postage Stamp.
It is hereby notified that, on and after the 13th instant, a new Postage Stamp, described
below, of the value of Five Shillings, will be issued in substitution for the one now
current. Until, however, the supply of the present Five Shilling Stamp becomes
exhausted, such stamp may be used.
Description of New Five Shilling Stamp.
The stamp is printed in mauve lake. The design consists of an
outline map of Australia, showing the Colonies of New South Wales,
Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. The
map is surrounded by an octagonal band, on the upper half of which
are printed in large characters the words “ New South W ales Postage,”
and on the lower half the words “ Five Shillings.” On the right-hand
side of the stamp, and placed over the abovementioned octagonal band,
is a representation of the New South Wales shield, and in a similar position on the left-
hand side is one of the Imperial shield. Immediately beneath the map the words “ One
Hundred Years” are printed in small characters.
D. O’CONNOR.


This stamp was first printed on the old five-shilling brown paper. It is
now printed on the specially prepared paper, which is similar to that in ordinary
use, but bears the water-mark 5/- over N.S.W. in a diamond. The size of the
diamond is from side to side f inch, or from angle to angle about lAth inch.
Envelopes. —On July 15th, 1888, an envelope, of the value of one penny,
similar to the previous one, of the ordinary commercial size, on white-laid paper,
was issued with the stamp of the new type. The corresponding two-penny
envelope did not make its appearance until much later.
Post Cards. —A new post card was issued in September, 1888, bearing the
new one penny stamp in the right upper angle. To the left is a figure of the
Waratah. The letters of the heading “ New South Wales ” are arranged in a
scroll-shaped form, and in the royal arms below there is no motto, which is also
absent on the scroll underneath the arms and animals which are represented
couchant. The card is cream-coloured, and is printed in mauve. At a later
period the Waratah was redrawn.
Jubilee Post Cards. —The establishment of a Postal Card system between
New South Wales and the United Kingdom, on January Ist, 1889, necessitated
the issue of suitable cards. A Post Card, of the value of two-pence, was
therefore issued for use by the contract packets of the Peninsular and Oriental
and the Orient Steam Navigation Companies only, by what is termed the long sea
route, i.e., conveyed all the way from Australia, by sea, to England. A Post
Card, of the value of three-pence, was also issued for use between this Colony
and the United Kingdom overland, via Italy.
As the year 1888 happened to be the fiftieth since the introduction of
Postage Stamps in the Colony of New South Wales, the necessity that arose for
the issue of special Post Cards was availed of to commemorate this jubilee event
by including in the design of these Post Cards a reference to the occasion.
The size of the Post Card, of the value of two-pence, is by 3tV inches,
and it is printed in blue.
The size of the Post Card, of the value of two-pence, is by 3A inches,
and it is printed in light green.


The design (which is the result of the joint effort of Dr. Houison, President
of the Philatelic Society, Mr. Dalgarno, of the Post Office, and Mr. Potter, the
Government Printer) of both stamps is the same, except in the value indications,
and may be described as follows :
In the centre is a similitude of the first stamp issued in the year 1838, containing
Royal arms, with motto “ Dieu et mon droit,” and words “ General Post Office, Sydney,
New South Wales,” surrounding the same. This similitude is enclosed by two circles
containing the words “In commemoration of the fiftieth year of the issue of postage
stamps in the Colony,” and “ Design of the first postage stamp.” This rests upon a St.
Andrew’s Cross, the upper limbs of which contain the figures denoting the value of the
postage with rings containing words “Jubilee” and “Stamp.” The lower limbs of the
cross respectively bear the figures “ 1838” and “ 1888.” Through the design and
enclosing it is a wreath composed of oak and eucalyptus leaves, with band at foot
containing words indicating the value of postage.
To the left of the design above described are the words “ Post ” in large capitals,
and below this in smaller type “ The address only to be written on this side of the card,”
To the right are the words “ Card,’ and in the one case “For the United Kingdom by
the long sea route,” and in the other “For the United Kingdom overland vid Italy.”
The whole is enclosed in an ornamental double-lined border.
They were gazetted on December 27th, 1888.
Service Stamj)s. —The first of the Centennial series to be surcharged O.S.
for official use was the one penny. This was first issued on July 17th, 1888.
The two-pence followed on October 15th, 1888. The four-pence was issued on
October 10th, 1889, and the sixpence on January 16th, 1889; the one shilling
and the five shillings on the 9th January, 1890; and the twenty shillings on
the 10th March, 1890. As there is a considerable supply of the old eight-penny
on hand, it is scarcely likely that the new issue will be surcharged for some time.
Service Envelopes were issued for the use of the Department of
Public Instruction, of the value of one penny, but with the O.S.
engraved in the upper spandrels. Two sizes of envelopes were issued.
One of the ordinary commercial size, without printing on the face;
the other of foolscap size, and printed on the face with the address
of the department.
In connection with this issue, although not of the Centennial
series, maybe mentioned the six-penny O.S. envelope. These were
issued to prepay postage and registration fee from the country Public
Schools Savings Banks to head office. The old six-penny die, with
the letters O.S. engraved in the upper corner was used. The
envelope was of foolscap size, and had the direction, &c., printed
on the front. The whole was crossed with a red band,


Among the other issues of the official series have been one penny and
two-penny envelopes for the use of special departments. The one penny is
printed on Treasury envelopes of the size 4| in. x3f in. The stamp is the same
as that before described with the O.S. engraved in the spandrels. The two-penny
is printed on the Treasury envelopes, and surcharged O.S. in black, and also on
commercial size envelopes, with a cameo on the flap. On all these the name of
the department, &c., is printed.
Private Envelopes. Many of these have been issued; but, as their name
is legion, and as they are printed on any envelopes that may be sent in, it will
be understood that any attempt to catalogue them, at the present time, would be
useless. The only one that deserves mention is that printed in August, 1889.
Messrs. Harrison, Jones, and Devlin, requiring to send out a large number of
circulars, forwarded to the General Post Office 3,000 envelopes, to have a Two-
penny Stamp impressed on each. Through some blunder, the Government
Printer received the order from the Postal Authorities to impress One Penny
Stamps on them. This was done, and the envelopes were returned to the firm.
Naturally, they declined to take them, and returned them to the Postal
Authorities. The question then arose, as to how they could change the One
Penny Stamp into a Two-penny. After some consideration, it was decided to
print another One Penny alongside the first. We have thus the great curiosity
of an envelope with two impressed One Penny Stamps side by side.
Wrappers, both public and private, have been issued. The latter of every
kind and on every shape of paper.


THE PRESENT METHOD OF PRINTING STAMPS IN THE NEW SOUTH WALES
GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.
’ill 8 we have already seen, in the report of the Post Office Board for
•CpfpjM 1851, the printing of stamps at that period was performed in the General
Post Office. The details of the process are well described in Mr. Boyd’s
Vj>r- evidence. As that has been given in full, it is unnecessary to do more
than ask the reader to refer to it, and compare the then laborious
method with that about to be described. The press used in 1850, as well as that
used for printing the Laureated series, are both well depicted in our illustrations.
In 1855 the Stamp Printing Branch was removed to the Immigration Barracks
at Hyde Park, and on January Ist, 1857, to the present buildings. The first
Government Printer who was connected with the printing of stamps was Mr.
William Hanson, who held the office from February 15th, 1854, until June,
1859. He was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Richards, who retired on November Ist,
1886. His successor was Mr. Charles Potter, the present Government Printer
and Inspector of Stamps. Mr. Potter, who entered the Department in 1851, and
has taken part in nearly every incident of its rise and development, was appointed
Superintendent as far back as February, 1860.
The Stamp Branch is under the control of the Government Printer, who
holds a separate appointment as Inspector of Stamps, The whole of the
operations —including cutting, printing, gumming, and perforating —are con-
ducted in a suite of rooms over that occupied by the Inspector. These rooms
are connected with each other by means of fire-proof doors, and are isolated
from the rest of the Department. The entrance door has two locks, of which
the Foreman, Mr. Chapman, keeps one key, and the Chief Clerk, Mr. G. Kellick,


keeps the other. One lock only, for which the Foreman has the key, is used
during working hours. The stamps in course of manufacture are secured in fire-
proof safes, which are kept in the room. The plant consists of
1 D. Napier & Sons Patent Double Platen Stamp Printing Machine.
4 “ Albion” Stamp Printing Presses, each with “indicator” attached.
1 Envelope Stamping Machine, with “ indicator ” attached,
1 Steel-plate Printing Press, with “ indicator ” attached.
1 Power Guillotine.
1 Rotary Perforating Machine.
5 Double-cutting Perforating Machines.
1 Screw Press.
1 Drop-hammer, for striking moulds in lead from steel postage stamp
dies.
1 Power Gumming Machine.
2 Drying Cupboards.
The motive power is communicated by a belt connected with shafting in
the basement. Before proceeding with the description of the method of printing,
let us glance for a moment at the system of check adopted.
1. Water-marked paper for use in printing stamps is obtained from
England in the shape of books, and is supplied by the Superinten-
dent of Stores to the Inspector of Stamps on requisition approved
by the Treasury.
2. Before delivery the Superintendent of Stores inserts in the front of
each book a certificate that it contains so many sheets to print so
many stamps of a stated denomination. The Accountant receives
and checks the books in conjunction with the Storekeeper of the
Department, both initialling the butts, and both keeping an account
of the paper received,
3. The paper is taken care of by the Accountant. It is by him issued
to the Foreman of the Stamp Branch, on a requisition signed by
the latter, initialled by the Chief Clerk, and approved by the
Inspector.
4. The paper is cut from the books by a guillotine in the Stamp Room.
The butts are initialled as correct by the Foreman, who hands them
to the Accountant, monthly, for transmission to the Auditor-General
with the monthly return.


5. The number of impressions taken are shown by an indicator attached
to each press, and the quantity of paper used by the Foreman is
checked thereby.
6. The plates are in charge of the Inspector. They are issued to the
Foreman as required.
7. Postage stamps are issued on the requisition of the Secretary to the
Postal Department. The requisitions are presented by an officer
of the Postal Department, who brings with him a box in which to
place the stamps, but for which he has no key. The stamps are
counted by the Chief Clerk and by this officer, and deposited in
the box. The box is unlocked and locked in this Department by
the Chief Clerk only; and in the Postal Department by the Cashier,
who has a duplicate key. The requisitions, after being satisfied,
are recorded, and then passed to the Accountant for entry.
8. A book showing the daily state of the Stamp Branch is kept by the
Foreman. It is checked every afternoon by the Chief Clerk, and
submitted to the Inspector on the following morning.
9. Stock is taken monthly, and the following returns made by the
Inspector:—
To the Treasury—
(l.) Return of Stamps printed and issued.
To the Audit Office—
(2.) Similar return in detail (attested). The butts of the books
used during the month accompany this return.
(3.) Return of paper on hand, &c.
To the Postmaster-General—
(4.) Return of the number and value of stamps issued.
10. The Superintendent of Stores makes a monthly return to the
Treasury of the paper issued to the Inspector of Stamps.
11. The periodical destruction of spoiled stamps is done under the
supervision of two officers of the Audit Department, who are
appointed on each occasion that they are required.
To return, now, to the method of printing stamps. As already described,
the Foreman receives a number of books of paper, appropriate for the denomina-
tion of stamp he is going to print. The paper is cut from these by means of the


guillotine. It is then passed on to the printing machine. The one now in use
in the Colony is that known as D. Napier & Sons’ patent double platen. (Plate
XIY.) The advantages of using this machine in preference to the old presses
are many, as it secures greater regularity in the working, much better results
in quality and quantity of work done, and effects a great saving of time. As
the machine is double ended, two kinds of stamps can be printed upon it
at the same time, the separate ink ducts and rollers allowing of two different
colours being used. The stamps are printed from electrotype blocks (taken
from the original steel dies) in sheets of 240 stamps, except in the case of the
higher values, when the blocks only contains fifty labels. The machine at
present runs at 1,000 revolutions, or impressions, per hour, with two hands
feeding, and gives very good results at that speed. It can, however, be arranged
to work at a much greater rate if required. Taking the rate given, as that in use
at present, the number of stamps printed in a day of six hours’ work, amounts to
no less than 1,440,000. Compare this with the number struck off in a day by
Kay in the old Post Office ! From the printing press, after the ink has become
dry, the stamps are passed on to be gummed. In the early days this was done
with a No. 2 painter’s brush, the result being a very uneven distribution of the
adhesive. Now the work is performed by a Power gumming machine. (Plate
XY.) In this machine, which is a recent invention, the sheets of stamps are fed
to a cylinder, as in a printing machine; by this cylinder they are carried round,
back upwards, till they are brought into contact with the gumming roller; this
latter is of composition, and is fed by a parallel brass roller, which revolves in the
gum trough. The gummed sheets are delivered on to a rotating cloth, which
discharges them at some distance dry enough to be handled. As the sheets are
a little damp when they come off the gumming machine, they are hung on racks
to be dried. These racks are placed in the drying cupboard, which is heated by
gas. In this way the stamps are treated with the utmost expedition, under the
protection of lock and key when required, and independently of the state of the
weather. From this the sheets are passed on to the perforating machines. As
there are several of these in use, the spaces between the needles varies in each
machine, and consequently the number of perforations on different sheets will be
different. The sheets are perforated in rows, each sheet requiring as many
operations as there are rows of stamps. A machine is in course of being perfected
in the office,' which will perforate the whole sheet at one impression. The sheets
are then placed in bundles, and passed on to the Chief Clerk.
In addition to Postage Stamps, there are printed in this Branch Duty Stamps
and Tramway Tickets,


Before concluding let me give an interesting little memento from a
Philatelic point of view. It is the first letter ever received by the postal
authorities in Sydney, asking, not for unused stamps, but for defaced specimens !
It runs as follows :
Sir, 19 April, 1861.
Have the goodness to pardon the liberty that lam now taking. For some
time I have been forming a collection of defaced postage stamps of all nations, and have
received great assistance from postmasters in various parts of the world. May I there-
fore count upon your kind co-operation 1 Will you have the condescension to forward
me, at your own convenience, a few defaced stamps of every kind used in your Colony 1 The
reason why I ask for more than one of a sort is that I arrange the stamps in a book, in
columns of 6or 8, just as I can procure them. The Postmasters of Western Australia,
St, Helena, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, have kindly assisted me
by forwarding new stamps, whereas used ones answer my purpose equally as well.
I would not have ventured to trouble you had I been able to procure your stamps.
Respectfully apologising for this intrusion, and humbly hoping you will deign to notice
this urgent but simple appeal to your kindness, I have the honor to remain,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
Arithmetical Master, Upper School,
To W. H. Christie, Esq. Collegiate Institution, Liverpool, England.
Major Christie’s minute on this is as follows :
Mr. Abbott, if there is any one upstairs who sympathises with Mr. in
his search for the picturesque in the shape of defaced stamps, I can have no objection to
the stamps being supplied. The only fear is that if the hobby became contagious it would
be a serious matter. Perhaps Mr. Nelson will come to Mr. ’s rescue.—l 2-6-61.
Mr. Nelson, who evidently was not devoid of humour, added his minute
to this effect: —
Being a bit of a virtuoso myself I thought I had some “ Queensland ” stamps by
me, but I find now that I have not, and I regret that my custom of invariably making
personal use of all effigies of Her Majesty that come into my private possession deprives
me of the pleasure of assisting this curious collector. Might I venture to suggest the
excellent example of the liberal Postmasters-General of New Brunswick, &c., who for-
warded new postage stamps 1 They are not very dear. New South Wales must not be
behindhand in courtesy.—N.N.
On this the Postmaster-General made a further minute :
Let messenger collect duplicate postage stamps of every hind to supply this party.
In sending them inform him that he is the first and must be the last for whom tins trouble
will be taken. —l 4-6-61.
I need not say that this letter is most carefully treasured among the
records of the General Post Office of New South Wales,
