EDITOR'S FOREWORD.
In, introducing this miscellany of type
and tripe to your patient notice, we must
confess to feeling a good many misgivings;
which become greater and more pro-
nounced as the dread day of publication
draws nearer. For this is only an amateur's
paper, written and. edited by amateurs for
the sake of whiling away the time when it
hung too heavy on our hands. But our
aim is simply to give pleasure; and if this
paper merely succeeds in passing muster
as a tonic to enliven the effects of vaccina-
tion and kindred evils, we shall feel amply
rewarded. All profits —if any such thete
be—will be devoted to the Canteen Fund;
and it is hoped that there will be a fair
sum for that purpose. In conclusion, we
trust that no one will feel themselves in
any way attacked by anything that ap-
pears in our columns. Personality is the
spice of life,, even as hunger is of stew;
but nothing that we print lias in it- any
intention or thought of malice. - Having
delivered ourselves of this much, we step
aside as gracefully as possible to allow
the real artists to do their "turns," merely
wishing you, in conclusion, Bon Voyage,
and a happy return as soon as possible to
the land we love.

EDITORIAL.
In publishing this souvenir of our voy-
age, the Joint- Editors desire to explain
that the position was thrust upon then,
and therefore they would crave the in-
dulgence of critics.
The object of our labours is to place on
record, for the benefit of our friends, in
New Zealand and elsewhere, a short ac-
count of the joys of our voyage.
Our experience has been that the happi-
ness of a long sea voyage is determined by
three factors, namely, the comfort of the
ship, fellow-passengers- and weather.
In these things we have been specially
favoured of the gods.
The unanimous verdict is that the good
ship Devon is the steadiest upon which we
hate ever been privileged to travel.
Among the officers and. men there is a
spirit .of buoyancy and comradeship which
naught could destroy. One cause, brought
us together; one object inspires .us,' and
in striving to accomplish that there is no
ioom for fear or depression.
We have also the comforting knowledge
that the master and chief engineer, with
their staffs, have won our greatest con-
fidence and respect. They have striven to
make the voyage as comfortable and
happy as lies within their power.
Father Neptune has dealt very tenderly
with those who feared his power. Oniy
once did he perform a "haka" for our
special benefit, and the sight was both fas-
cinating and weird.
Old Sol has sent his kindly rays to open
and enliven the day with unfailing and
unstinted generosity. Thus lias fortune
shown herself more kind than has oft been
her custom.
We greatly miss those whom we have
left behind, yet proudly, joyously, and con-
tentedly we continue our journey, glad of
the opportunity of doing our bit in vin-
dicating the integrity and unity of our
Empire.
THE SILENT SEVENTEENTH HEROES.
All honour be to those who won
The cross "for valour" on the field.
Who steadfast fought, and would not yieid
Through all the battle strife and din..
But there are those who ate the stew,
With gallantry as great and grand,
Yet no one saw the tables manned
And thus the cold world never knew.
KATHLEEN.
A RONDEAU.
When we shall die, and pass into the dark,
These things alone we crave of any Gods
on high,
Unpitving still, beyond far Heaven's are
When we shall die:
That we, with lips on which there is no cry
May go; and brow whereon of, pain there
is no mark
With face unblancliecl, serene, and unclosed
eye.
For we have known the coward fears that
carls ,
Our- poor- weak souls; and lurking,
clust'ring, soon will fly
About- our hearts, as We put forth our
barque- •
When we. shall-die.

THE WIRELESS MAN.
(It is a sea-fact that all wireless men
have a monopoly of all news, correct and
otherwise, on board.)
Of rumours we've a fairish crop,
That grow as: rumours only can,
But if they rise, or if they drop,
They all come from the Wireless Man.
When Smith and Jones at breakfast say
Proving it by a detailed plan,
"Twelve Germ-han ships lie in oar way!"
They had it from the Wireless Man.
"In case, of submarine attack,"
>Says Brown, "the very wisest plan,
Is to dive off the aft smoke stack!
I had it from the Wireless Man!"
"Twelve Germ-hun aeroplanes are, here!"
So through the ship like fire it ran.
We tracked the rumour to it's lair —
It started with the Wireless Man!
So through the ship wild rumours flow,
On which stern Truth would place her
ban,
For yarns may come and yarns may go—-
Yet still yarns on the Wireless Man!
Oh, Wireless Man, if e'er I go
Above; and must explain my plan
Of life; and why, I've pulled, below,
The leg of many a fellow-man,
I'll, look S. Peter in the face,
And answer bold, if still I can:
"T'was not my fault, so please Your Grace,
1 learnt it—from- the Wireless Man"! ! !

ODE TO A COOK.
Oh cook to whom I owe these aches
And pains from which I suffer,
Whose heart delights in rock (like) cakes
And liver even tougher,
Thy skill is simply unsurpassed
At. making duffs —the kind which last! .
Oft when I taste the leaden fare
Thou put'st upon my table
I long to -seek my food elsewliere
But ah—no more I'm able!

LIFE ON A TROOPSHIP.
Have you ever been to sea on board a
troopship, I wonder? No? Well, its
great! The average "person knows very
little about the work, running, and pro-
visioning of a ship carrying from 5)00 to
1,000 men. So perhaps a few remarks will
enanle you to get a little idea of the daily
routine 'and life generally upon the go >4
ship "Devon." A hotel to accommodate a
thousand people is a fairly large place,
and the dining-room and kitchen are in
proportion. But on board we only have
a limited space, so ways and means of
carrying on have had to be evolved.
Each day at 5 bells (10 30 a.m.) an in
sped,ion of the whole ship by the Master
and the Staff is carried cut, and woe be-
tide the miserable person or tiling whose
work in this direction is weighed and
found wanting. The mess room is the
first place visited, and it is here that
space for 450 men is provided. There are
26 tables, each seating 17 men, and each
table provides two men as mess orderlies.
These men go to the cook-house upon the
bugle sounding, and draw the food and tea
for the remainder. In rough weather the,
orderlies have rather an exciting time con-
veying their mates' food to it's destina-
tion. During the first few days it was
quite a common sight to see a dish of
stew trickle gently down someone's back.
We liave two sittings in the mess-room,
so each week the men change from firss
to second sitting. By inspection time all
the tables and forms have been scrubbed,
the floors swept and sanded, and the scup
pers have received a sprinkling of disin-
fectant. This work is carried out by a
mess-room fatigue, which works under the
supervision of four permanent mess-room
sergeants. From the mess-room we go
below to the dormitories, where over 900
men sleep. The ventilation is by three
hatchways, assisted by canvas windsaiis,
and steel bell-mouthed ventilators. Dur
ing the day only the dormitory sergeants
remain below to take charge of a fatigue
party, whose duty it is to thoroughly
sweep and clean out the dormitory. The
bunks are arranged in tiers, three high.
Great care is taken that everything is
kept perfectly clean and sweet. Bunks ai'c
all numbered, and each bunk is inspected
daily. Each man must i oil up his pal-
liasse, then fold his blankets and place
them on top of the palliasse, thus allowing
plenty of air to circulate through his
bunk. His kit-bag is packed in a special
rack, and he may—and generally does—
obtain it at any time he wishes.
Next come the shower baths and wash-
ing-houses. There are 40 showers, 27 on
the port, 13 on the starboard side. Each
morning the men parade at 0.30. and have
a shower, and the hotter the weather the
more willing becomes the patronage.
Every week a day per company is sat
aside for washing and airing of bedding.
Fresh water is drawn for the washing of
clothes to the extent of one gallon per
man. This may not strike you as a large
amount, but the daily consumption of
fresh water amounts to 18 or 19 tons, and
we consequently cannot afford unlimited
ciuantities.
The showers and washing-houses arc.
again under sanitary fatigue men, and it
is their duty to keep these places well
flushed out witli salt water.
Have you ever seen a ship's cook at
work? It's a great sight. Imagine sett-
ing out to cook for a thousand men in a
kitchen measuring no more than 20 by 25
feet at the outside. Steam plays an im-
portant part in this kitchen, and there are
four large steam boilers, besides two
ranges. And it is from these that the
men are supplied with tea,, roast joints and
vegetables, to say nothing of steamed
puddings twice a week. Truly in this case
ex paullo multum fit!
Again, we have a fatigue party to peel
the potatoes anl cut up turnips and assist
tlie cooks generally.
Near by is the bake-house, where all the
bread is baked. Its no small job to bake
for the men, and the bread never lias a
chance to get stale. Here also small goods
are baked, and the baker more than hold 3
his own with his class on shore.
The hospital is next on the list, and is
presided over by two Red Cross Sisters,
assisted by tlie Ambulance Corps. Through
them we are enabled to give the sick care-
ful treatment, and, where necessary, special
diet.
Last, but not least, comes the canteen,
which is run for the benefit of the men,
all profits from sales going back to the
patrons at the end of the voyage. Prices
are very low,, and the articles stocked are
all of good: quality. Ail sales are trans-
acted by means of coupons, so no cash is
taken. The O.C. Canteen, before allowing
the inspecting party to proceed, demands
to see that coupons are forthcoming.
And so it goes on each day, for the first
essential on a troop ship is cleanliness,
which alone will enable us to land our
men in good fettle at their destination.
1 have no time to touch on recreation, but
what with drill, deck quoits and billiards,
and a hundred and one other things, few
of us find time hang very heavy on our
bands, and when the voyage is over most
of us will feel a pang of regret at parting
from our latest home.

REFLECTIONS.
Have you ever thought, my comrades,
As you hurry too and fro,
There's a presence ever near you
Watching o'er you where you go.
Every man doth have a guardian
Angel spirit, ever near,
'Tis the spirit of thy loved one
Thou mayst trust, and need not fear.
Do no thing you know would pain them,
Though their forms you cannot see.
Do as ycu would be done unto,
Clothe your actions with no plea,
Fearless stand before the tempter
Looking neither left nor right,
For the joys of the hereafter,
Cheer and crown the hard won fight.
[We append the following under protest,
as an awful example of what happens
when the office poet breaks into prose.
Also as a ditto, ditto, of what it must
feel like to be a censor. —Eds.]
A SOLDIER'S LOVE LETTER.
My Fairest and Most Adorable Darling,
When. I look into thy sky blue eyes and
meditate on thy sweet smiling face, I see
all the joys and pleasures of life. Come
to my arms, oh thou love of loves —oil of
citrons of my life, 1 see the honey dew on
those precious lips, and I cannot live with-
out thee, darling. As 1 think ol thee by
day,, and dream of thee by night, I am
carried away with ecstacy. Had I the
wings of an angel, I'd fly to thee as to a
spider's web, and feast my eyes on thy
countenance, ruddy as a pot of strawberry
jam. Do I not recollect the first day I
met thee, and that divine face o'er which
a blush comparable to a half cooked
lobster quickly spread. Come back to me,
for 1 cannot live without thee. Often 1
ask myself, "Why do 1 live?" —(So do we!
Eds.) —and indeed, without thee I shall
quickly die.—Farewell!
Your loving little peach,
Algernon Gohon,

MAL DE MER.
BY A SUFFERER.
When iirst we came aboard this boat
We thought it fine to write "AT SEA,"
ft seemed so grand to be afloat,
Upon the ocean, wild and free.
For at that time the sea was still,
And not a wave disturbed its face.
We strolled about tlie decks until
A wind sprang up from out- of space.
And tben our ship began to heave
And rose with us to meet each swell—
-1 say tlie SHIP began to heave,
But WE began to heave as well.
We watched the rail rock up anil down
Before our fascinated eyes.
At times we wished we hadn't come
And left our homes and other ties.
"Crack hearty," said some seasoned salt,
"Come up and give the mess a fly."
But I, whose in'ards were at fault,
Said "leave me here, and let me die."
But now we strut around and yell,
And skite about our tip-top form!
Perhaps another tale we'll tell,
If we should run into a storm!

AT THE SIGN OF THE "RED
TRIANGLE."
(The excellent work of the Y.M.C.A. en
board this'ship is evident to all ranks.
The following article, by Mr. Morton, who
needs no introduction to any 011 board,
should therefore be read with interest.--
Eds.)
Since this war commenced, many thou-
sands of men have had cause to bless the
Red Triangle, and all that it stands for.
The opinion prevalent a few years ago —
that the Y.M.C.A. was nothing hut a hot-
bed of Wowsers—is to-day held by none.
Ere the war was well started the Y.M.C.A.
had established Depots, with rest rooms,
reading and writing rooms, games halls,
bathrooms, canteens, libraries,, concerts,
services of prayer and praise, home com-
forts, and the right hand of brotherhood
all at the service of the soldiers. At the
Training Camps at Home, Naval Bases,
Railway Depots, Ports of Embarkation,
and. in every town in England and Scot-
land these bases are to be found. They
are in full swing in the disease stricken
areas of operations iii Mesopotamia, and
right along the lines of communication, in
Egypt the work done has met with the
highest approval from the King right
through the High Commands. On Galli-
pcli the Triangle holds its own, and has
carried comfort and blessing to many
thousands of our brave lads. In every
spot now occupied by British troops tile
Red Triangle is to be found to-day. The
meaning of it all, as applied to our Boys,
is that through our organization they can
obtain much comfort, and at times save
themselves much trouble. We are pre-
pared to: —-
Handle money in transit to or from the
troops.
Receive and forward parcels either way.
Arrange for cables either way.
Make wills, and give them safe custody.
Accept charge of valuables for the men
while on service.
We arc in the work for your benefit,
and nothing is too much trouble for a
genuine Y.M.C.A. worker. We are the
direct representatives of millions of sub-
scribers to our War Funds, and we are
endeavouring to administer the funds so
that you may be spared suffering, and that
you may be given some brightness.
To the folks at Home the Y.M.C.A.
means a ready and certain channel of com-
munication between the Boys and their
loved ones, and also the knowledge that
the comfort of the Boys is being studied
and catered for in every possible way. We
are looking for trouble, and we expect it
from both the soldiers and their friends.
Send it along, as we relish it- in large
quantities. We expect you to make the
fullest possible use of all facilities pro-
vided by our Organization, at any place
where we are established. It lies with
you to prove our worth. God bless you,
and keep you all in the hollow of His
Hand.

THE UNWRITTEN LAW.
(BY GUY COCHON VENTRE.)
I had been privileged to go and see this
murderer, who lay there under sentence of
death.
He was by no means unresponsive, and
was, indeed, pathetically eager to impress
some of his views on me, for the benefit,
as he, said, of others who might contem-
plate thp same thing. The story of the
murder was a strange one, containing
various curious elements, and —but let the
murderer tell his story in his own
vv ords:
'Tt was on a troop ship," he began,
"and we shared a cabin. By we, of course
I mean my late unhappy friend and my-
self. When we came on board we were the
greatest of friends; we shared our cigars,
our beer —when we got it —our C.8.; in
short, ail our joys and sorrows. For the
first week all was well. During the second
I began to notice various things about
him, which had previously only amused
me, but which now I began to realise were
a part of a deep laid scheme to drive me
cut of my mind. Little things only they
were: but there was a deep meaning in
them; whose significance became gradu-
ally plainer and plainer to me as the voy-
age continued. For one thing, he was
bald. Baldness is not a thing that is al-
ways irritating, but baldness in a friend is
not desirable is it?
"For another, lie had a peculiar laugh —
a kind of liquid gurgle, as of a narrow-
necked water-bottle emptied when half
full.
"Inoffensive things, I grant; but pro-
tracted for weeks—ah!
"During the third week I became con-
scious of other infirmities in my poor
friend's character. He had, for instance,
a trick of beginning a sentence with Y
say!' and ending with 'Don't you think
so?' If you didn't, and said so, he would
counter at once, and invariably with 'lt's
not necessarily so?'
"Then, if I made a harmless remark
about necessity knowing 110 law, or being
the soul of wit, or something, he would
curl his upper lip, and, with a laugh, which
in my insaner moments reminded me of a
high-keyed hot-water bottle, would re-
mark, 'lsn't that funny? Wonderful, isn't
it?'
"In the next few days I became pain-
fully conscious of several other defects.
There was, for instance, the fact that his
pyjamas had a green and yellow stripe.
Tl.is I gradually began to regard as a
species of direct insult to myself. Also
his obvious remarks became more and
more frequent, and he developed a dis-
tressing mania for had puns. He further
used to attempt to sing early in the morn-
ings, and this, alas, became unbearable.
"I taxed him with being an unmitigated
nuisance, and a cumberer of the earth, on
several occasions, but he only smiled, and
murmured that his father had often told
him that a thing was not worth doing at
all that was worth doing well. He further
remarked, apropos of nothing, that his
father was a gentleman. My rage against
hiip rose to perilous heights, and I took
refuge in the puerile sarcasm 'that it Was
a pity that his father hadn't done as much
for him.' He laughed like a fluttered ant
cackling lien, and went out. From that
moment I resolved to kill him.
1 "1 spare you the recital of the, following
weeks; suffice it to say that he developed
worse and worse failings. But even then
I might have spared him, had it not been
for my final discovery. Several nights
during that last week I suffered front in-
somnia, and one night, when I was just
dropping asleep, he. began to snore! My
anger rose to boiling point; it was the
culminating point of a series of personal
insults deliberately hurled at me by this
loathsome wretch; in a paroxysm of rage
I seized a large piece of salt-water soap,
crammed it down his throat, and choked
him!
"After this a feeling of great peace came
over me, and it hias lasted ever since. I
returned to bed, and dropped asleep, mur-
muring the last lines of Longfellow's
'Village Blacksmith.' —
"'Something attempted, something done
Has earned a night's repose.'"
He ceased, and looked at me. My heart
yearned for him, for had I not had similar
voyages, and did I not know only too well
the feelings which lie had so graphically
described. I grasped his hand, speechless
with emotion, and left him. Later, I heard
that he had entered a plea of justifiable
homicide, and had been triumphantly
acquitted. Peace to his ashes! I would
that there were more like him.

"UNEASY LIES THE ARM THAT
WEARS A CROWN."
Yesterday afternoon, on a quiet spot
on deck, our Company Poet was preparing
to write something for the ship's journal.
Strange as it may seem, the official title
of our poet is "Company .Sergeant-Major,"
and when not engaged in writing up his
roster, bustling us on to parade, or
fatigue, lie writes poetry.
He rather prides himself on his poems,
and before this had written various pieces
on sucli subjects as ' The C'.B. Call'' and
"The Last Drink." He always had to
borrow a pen or pencil from some poor
unoffending chap who was never likely to
see it back again. None of his former
pieces would do for the ship's paper, how-
ever, but he must have something original,
I was told, something that would make him
famous not only on the ship but through-
out the literary portion, of the Empire,
something (and this was between our-
selves) that would make him too valuable
to be sent to the front.
I reminded him that writing poetry was
not of much practical. value at the present
time and that some of our leading artists
—'but at this I was treated to such a look
of pity that I was silenced.
When I saw him he was already in a
poor humour for writing.
The O.C. had "been worrying him about
the Company's rifles, several men had com-
plained at being on dormitory fatigue, and
a cake which he had been saving for a
special occasion had gone mouldy.
My arrival didn't tend to make things
sweeter, so I sat down beside him and
kept quiet. He had borrowed from our
youngest and juiciest lance-corporal a
brand new fountain, pen, which was a part-
ing gift from an adoring girl. (I made a
mental note to warn that "lance-jack"
without delay).
"How can a man write when everyone
comes to him over the slightest trouble,"
he complained. "I was thinking of some-
thing about ." "Sergeant-Major, the
Orderly Officer wants you," yelled a voice.
"Damn, the Orderly Officer!" to me, but
to him, "Y r es, sir."
The Orderly Officer wanted to know why
the mess orderlies had not been on par-
ade during the last few days, and in-
structed .him to see that they were in
future. He went away to fix that up,
and by the time he had returned there
were four people waiting to see
him. A platoon sergeant didn't
see why his platoon should al-
ways supply the guards; a chap was
after canteen coupons, and thought the
Sergeant-Major had them, another wanted
the 'ship's time, and still another inquired
if he could mention calling at in
his letters. When told to go to a hotter
place he looked surprised. Personally I
thought the chaplains were censors and I
didn't think he would find them there.
However, I ventured no opinion but sug-
gested that he should get going .on Lis
poem.
"I was thinking," lie began again, when
a message came to report to the O.C. at
once. He came back swearing and in-
formed me that the company's rifles should
bi checked straight away. 1 retired.
That evening the' Sergeant-Major was
suffering from a deep-seated pain to all
appearance, but I discovered that he was
endeavouring to make another start. This
time he got a bit further.
"I was thinking of writing something
about our leaving Wellington Harbour.,
starting like this, "A wet sheet, a flowing
sea," he said.
When I suggested that something
original would be better, he turned on me,
"Well, isn't that original, you ass."
No answer from me. 1 presumed he
meant that it was so when first .written.
1 didn't dare after that even to think that
this was a steamer not a sailing ship.
Probably lie was thinking of the wind-
sails. "Well, how about something like
this," he suggested. "Are you the Sergeant-
Major of Company?" asked the
Principal Medical Officer, suddenly appear-
ing in front,
"Yes, sir."
"Do you know that some of your men
are in their bunks, smoking cigarettes and
eating biscuits?"
"No, sir."
"Well, why don't you go round the lines
occasionally to see what's happening in
your company? What are you doing now?
"Writing a poem, sir."
"Writing a poem!" Here the P.M.O.
got red in, the face, and, replacing his eye-
glass, which had fallen through his agita-
tion, continued, "and your men lying in-
their hunks behaving so that they will cer-
tainly get C.'S.M., measles and goodness
knows what other disease, but you sit
there writing a poem! !" With a fierce
snort, he tramped off to report to the O.C.
Troops that unless more supervision was
kept over the men in their dormitories he
would not be responsible for any outbreak
of disease.
The Sergeant-Major sadly laid down his
paper and put the borrowed pen in his
bag, there to remain until forgotten. The
last words I heard as I departed were: "It
would have been a grand piece, but "
"Sergeant-Major, the O.C. wants you."

HEARD AT SICK PARADE.
(Billy wants a few days sick leave.)
'Arry: "'Ow are yer going to kid 'em.

ODE TO M.L.C.
We've seen some mighty eaters in wander-
ing round this sphere,
We've seen 'em chew tobacco and we've
seen 'em chewing .beer
We've heard of vegetarians and cannibals
galore,
Of chaps who lived on rats and dogs and
half-a-dozen more.
We've heard of some strange diets too.,
when on our travels rare.
Of blokes who lived on Irish stew, • and
thought well of the fare,
But the chap who takes the buttered bun,
m our experience wide,
Is the one who goes for condensed milk,
on all things, boiled or fried.

DREAMS.
Before me t-liere stretches, and surges,
and seethes
A moon kissed, star-crowned sea;
And dim thro' the distance behind me dnj
memory weaves
A vision of Homeland to me.
And I dream thro' the daytime —a vague,
vain dream,
In my waking, toil-worn hours
Of a country whose, mountains are reared
'midst tile clouds,
And whose highlands are veiled in the
incense of flowers.
And in fancy again I see a vine-covered
cot,
With /cozy, soft carpeted floor,
Where starlings quarrel and nest in the
eaves,
And proud roses bow low at the door.
And I people this region with those whom
I've left,
The dear ones who come in tile night, oft
in spectral design,
Blood of my blood, love of my live,
The soul of my soul —and its shrine.

THE LAST DRINK.
This is the last drink!
Also, how I fear
The long days of journey without you,
my beer!
You sparkle so coldly,
You're fire to my brain;
1 know that the morrow will bring with
it pain.
Yet do I not leave thee,
Thou r.eetar oi godis.
Till I see curling serpents and fast jumping
frogs.
I fear not the Sergeant,
Nor dread the C.8.,
'Tis being without you that sorroweth me!

C. B.
I'm rather fond of music, arid when I came
to camp
The sounding of the bugles full oft
appealed to me,
But their charm has gone away, and they
haunt me night and day,
Since that beggar of an officer has given
me C.B.
When I'm hanging o'er Hie side, with a
sort of vacant feel
Near the region where in months gone
by, my waistcoat used to be.
I heat the dread refrain, and I have to run
again.
For mal-de-mer's no reason for neglecting
your C.B.
Of course I get a cheer from the boys
along the deck,
As I race to chase the bugle, a minute or
so late.
But it pleases me to think, that so far Fve
dodged the clink,
And they say the noisy bugle will soon be
out of (late.

FALSE PRETENCES. J -
It has always been an enigma to me since
we hit the long and rocky trail to camp,
why certain people ever came along to join
the Army. In confidence, lam not absol-
utely sure why I signed on myself. One
chap I know gave. me a reason that would
probably hold water for a lot of us,:—
"Other silly" fool's did it !" he opined; and
I am inclined to think there was a good
deal in what he said. Of course, you
can't lay that down as a rule!, because there
would be too many exceptions, and what is
more, it is highly improbable that any chap
would tell you his real reason for. taking
the jrash step." Take my case. I'm natur-
ally open-minded and truthful, as men go,
yet I have deliberately given out that I
wear khaki because my King and Country
need me. Now, my friend Agony Thomp-
son is far more candid. To get at his
reason, you must go back over the last six
years of his personal history. During that
period, I have it on the best authority,
Agony has been known ,to be sober on
slightly fewer than half a dozen occasions,
and mostly Sundays at that. Therefore it
did not surprise me when he pleaded "false
pretences" as his reason for allowing him-
self to be caught. "I was talking to several
of my cobbers one night, in the bar of the
'Empire,' " he said. "You kgow how it is.
I didn't mean to get stunned, but after we
had a dozen or so, I felt a bit 'on.' Then
th'ey started talking about the war, and
that was the stone end of me. They
kidded me there 1 was a wet canteen in the
camp, and you only did two hours work a
day. That Sounded good to me, so we all
went straight Up and signed on. I woke
up in the morning to the full, horrible
realisation of what I'd been, and done.
That's why I say I'm here under false pre-
tences."
Whatever the reason, Agony has turned
out a fairly good soldier. His docile dis-
position and somewhat shattered physigue
not unably fit him for the job of sanitary
policeman, work that is rigbt in his line.
What is more, he hasn't been drunk since
we left our last port of call.
So, as one who has studied this problem,
I want you to take Agony's case as an,ex-
ample, and don't be in too much hurry to
believe every one who tells you that they
signed on because they got thrills every time
they played "Rule Britannia."

THE CENSOR.
Tho' far away from home, sweet home,
Mid sights and pleasures new,
There's nothing much to tell our friends
When ,we write, a line or two*
We have on board a censor,
And a busy time has he,
For he reads right through our letters
Before they cross the sea.
We must not say just where we are,
Or at what ports we call,
For if we try to tell too much,
They may not hear at all.

THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA.
The merry medicos looked put .
On the troop deck laden
Where the boys' lay round about
Those who weren't paradin.'
The Major's eye lit up with joy, i
The one without a glass in,
Says he, "I have a scheme, me hoy,
To keep the time a-passing.
Just see these soldiers every one, ,
Our duty is, to mend 'em,
But as of sickness they have none,
Disease we'll, have ,to send .'p.m.
This scheme of .mine when they all know,
I'm sure will fascinate 'em,
We'll bring them up from down below
And then we'll vaccinate 'em.
For we have vaccine by the quart,-
It seems a shame to waste it;
Methinks it were a kindly thought,
Why, just to let 'em, taste it.
The deadly plot was duly hatched,
The Sisters, too, -assisted,
So every soldier man was scratched,
And not a one resisted.

THE WORTH OF A WOMAN.
The worth of a woman ! Why, God alone
knows,
From the crown of her head to the tip of
her toes,
She is one contradiction,
Both joy and affliction.
Foil of sagacity, joy and audacity,
Pretty and witty, and awfully gritty.
She's pleasing and teasing, and—sometimes
—appealing,
And sunny and funny and just made for
money ;
She's brimful of mirth from the day of her
birth,
Just being and seeing and afternoon tea-ing.
We kiss her, dismiss her —but Lord, how <ve
miss her ;
So haunting and taunting and more or less
wanting.
In leisure she's pleasure and jolly good
measure,
The breath of our life, whether sweetheart
or wife ;
Altho' we may grumble, she don't care a
jot,
She knows she is welcome to what we have
got.
So here is a statement, dispute if you can,
The thoughts of a pretty well average man ;
Search out the truth and then run it io
ground
Just, what's the ship worth when she isn't
around.

THE SIGNALLERS . . . ,
Like all other transports which, have left
New Zealand's shore, .
The Devon has her complement of signallers
on board :
First there's Jaeksbn, ■ he's a corporal and
our senior N.C.O.
The ladies they all love him and think him
such a beau. 1 -
Yet another corporal have ' We, who's . i'i.r
from being an ass,
But when engaged in ciyil life was fond of
making" "gas."
Our songster is named Foote, and a pleasant;
voice has he-,'
Who sings and sings and sings until 'lie
cannot see.
Old Dick Lewis is a champion in all things
real an' true.
But his appetite's amazing when his is wad-
ing into stew. ■
On photography, Norm Partridge had almost
gone quite crazy
Until he came upon the sea and now he's
far too lazy.
Then Thomson is our chess king, and a rial
good sort is he,
For when FNtz sees his copper knob for
safety he sure will flee.
Alb Trott, of near Waimate, is a kind and
cheerful chap,
Though, he's; not much good at "buzzer,"
he's a tiger for a nap.
Now, Nixon is a healthy youth who hails
from "dear" Parnell,
But I'm sure a lot of hungry fish have been
treated by him well;
Whilst.Andy Halpin of Dunedin, is right up
against compulsion,
Who after a night out swings straight for
~ Lane's emulsion.
Then there's Watson of the survey, who is
a sporting bloke,
And when in the Tirewera paid a guinea for
a joke.
Of Milne I am quite at a loss to' know
just what to say,
But what I do know is he climbed Mt. Cook
the other day.
Well, here's luck to all the signallers who
are travelling on this punt, 1
And may they never fail you, boys, when
serving at the front,
For if this service is shattered and they're
sadly in a fix,
You may mark my word upon it, 'tis with
the Huns you'll mix. .

BIRDS.
THE MASTER BIRD (Jacko tarium),
This popular bird makes his.hpme upon the
pcfean, arid is readily distinguished by .fug
handsome blue plumage with golden wing
markings. His nest is most luxurious, and
he sings divinely.
THE CHIEF BIRD (Fou fou valyo.).—
This intelligent bird is similar in plumage
to the master bird, with the addition of blue
wing markings. His principal, food is
haggis, and he is not easily tamed,
THE O.C. BIRD, (Squeamishi).—ls cf
dull plumage, and lives in solitary, state in
a luxurious, nest while migrating. He pre-
fers to live far inland.
THE CHAPLAIN BIRDS live together
in loVe and discord, their voices being diffi-
cult to blend. They store up seeds of, wis-
dom all the week and cast them before swine
on Sunday.
THE P.M.O. BIRD (Casearai).—ls so
named from his Penchant for Muck and
Odours, and the diligence with, which he
searches for the same.
THE Q.M. BIRD (smilei diali). This
sweet bird is of merry- disposition, and lives
in dark places amid secret hoards of rub-
bish. His native haunt is Wanganui.
The S.M. BIRD (Davidsoni). —This well-
known bird devours C.B.'s with great re-
lish. After slathering them with mustard
and vinegar he finds them an excellent hors
d'oeuvres.
THE Q.M.'S, BIRD (Cookei).—This valu-
able bird has four eyes and a beautiful white
star upon his wings. He haunts cook
houses and provides food for his hungry
flock.
THE PROVOST BIRD (Shikeri catchi).
—Takes young and thirsty birds tor taxi
rides for which they pay compound in-
terest.
THE DECK SERGEANT BIRDS (Rhino
fairyi).—Are so called from the Latin
(wealth and beauty). They paddle in salt
water and bask in the sun. They have no
other habits worth mentioning.
THE DORMITORY SERGEANT
BIRDS (Cigarette! catcher). —These birds
are natives of the lower regions, and search
for dossers and fags. They do not make
good pets.
P.M.O. (at sick parade) : "Well, my lad,
what is your trouble?"
Paddy : "If you plaze, sorr, I can't sleep
for insomnia."
FATIGUES.
Nowadays the Layman is well provided
with glowing articles on the work of the
various army departments. But few, if any,
pens have bestowed their attentions on that
tireless and all-powerful body, the fatigue
phrty—or rather, the Fatigue Department.
Headquarters of this excellent institution is
wraped and shrouded in the thickest gloom,
and its orders being usually similarly en-
shrouded are entirely beyond the compre-
hension of the poor wee private. Never-
theless, these orders, though coming down
with overwhelming suddenness, are always
welcome and joyfully received. We don't
think 1 Now, in the broad acres and
smiling fields of the camp there is ample
room for the playful gambols of the various
parties indulging in this form of recreation.
But on a troopship things are slightly (only
slightly, of course) overcrowded; and the
animated and gymnastic effect produced by
the contesting parties is truly wonderful.
First, the cook-house fatigue. Evidently
some catch, this job, as we see the same en-
lightened countenances day by day. These
of the potato peeling, meat mincing, and
onion opening order are the cause of all the
following fatigues, and so the contest rages
daily.
It opens when the spud sacks do, and the
play is quickly carried a-deek and below
by the numberless teams roaming to the
seat of .their labours. This calls into play
the. dormitory, dining-hall, and deck
fatigues, and. in this last we have the king
of the lot, whose sole object seems to be to
"wash out"—or over—everything on board.
For instance,, picture this eager squad, No.
27 platoon X Company, bravely attempting
to disport their burly figures at "Physic."
Their fifth try for a parade ground, by the
way ! "Arms fling" has just been grace-
fully accomplished, when flop ! down comes
—in Army parlance—hose, canvas, deck wet-
ting, one, and "smoko" becomes the order
of the day, while the spotless deck is
flooded. Once again "On the backs, down"
—just in time for a- cascade to foam down
during the third figure. Merely the nose
party on the hatch above ! In true Army
style they insist on putting the cart before
the horse, and wash the lowest decks first,
so that they cannot dry till it is time to
wet them again.
So successfully do these beastly fatigues
keep our old "Devon" inundated that we
are fully convinced that we are submarine
details, being inured to our future amphibi-
ous career. For we wallow about all day ;
fatigued by doing more work than the
fatigues themselves—in making way for
them !
BRUMMY.
[This recalls to us sad memories of dear
old Trentham, when we were only permitted
to put our bedding out to air on wet days. —

SOME OF "F" 17.
Upon the good ship Devon steaming some-
where out at sea,
There are many decent fellows, a goodly
company.
And though we all are voyaging to fight rhe
beastly Hun,
Still, we are not downhearted, we're always
' full of fun.
Take C n, for instance, a decent sort, of
chap,
But a terror for an argument; he doesn't
care a rap
What subject you are talking on, you bet lie
will be in it,
No matter how you bowl him out, his
wrangling is the limit.
And then there's old.T m M y, who
once had pretty curls,
The boy who back in M-st-r-n was loved by
all the girls —
By Christabel and Saucy Nell, by Sue and
dark-eyed Fanny,
But. best of all in old Tim's, eyes is one
called "Gentle Annie!"
Along with him is G B n, who bails
from far Riwaka;
He, like to shorty C 's, the d 1. of a
talker;
If you want to make him ratty, and as
vicious as a ram,
Just let him hear you criticise Kirkpatriek's
Nelson jam!
I'm not forgetting H n, whose bunk is
in a corner
So well set up, you'd think that he wore
corsets made by Warner!
He looks to me a youngster, but says,
"Great snakes alive,
If you will please believe me, I'm really
twenty-five !"
So now, hooray, we're off to France to battle
on the Iser,
And show the Germ-huns how -to fight, and
strafe the blooming Kaiser ;
So people of New Zealand, cheer up now,
and no more crying.
And trust your boys to do their bit to keep
the Old Flag flying.

A LAMENT.
White dreaming gently in the dormitory,
The sergeant's rancous voice awakened me,
"Rouse up, ye sluggards ! tumble, up on
deck,
And take a bath ! Fall in A Company" ! !
And we who lay so peacefully in bed,
Raising ourselves on languid elbow, said :
"Oh, go to—(censored). Leave us here, in
peace ;
Hot curse" lit upon our O.C.'s head.
And next we hear we're all up on the mat.
No, not the one beloved of Pussy Cat,
But where they hand out C.B. stunts to you,
In military life we all get that.
For three long days we these defaulters
care,
And empty vomit tubs for one and all, .
Or in the bunkers sweat amid the coal; "
Then air our woes at night in dining-hall.
Oh ! how I wish I were an officer,
A life in which no penalties occur,
But even that could be improved upon,
I'd like to be at home again with—"her."
