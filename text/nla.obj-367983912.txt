(i \\
memorial Address
“ Called and cboscn and faithful.”
Revelation 17:14.
I have chosen these words as ex-
pressing the calling, and character,
and work of the servant of God who
left earth for Heaven on Sunday
afternoon (August 20th), a fortnight
ago.
In the seventh chapter of Revela-
tion we read of the ‘ £ great multitude,
which no man could number, of all
nations, and kindreds, and people,
and tongues, standing before the
throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
with white robes, and palms in their
hands,” and crying “with a loud
voice, saying, Salvation to our God
which sittefh upon the throne, and
unto the Lamb.” In the passage
from which our text is taken we read
of the Lamb overcoming the enemy,
and of those with Him who over-
come, “called and chosen and faith-
ful.”
In Matthew 22:14 we are taught
that, “Many are called; but few
chosen”; but in the parable of the


talents, the chosen ones, who are faith-
ful, are made great by their integrity,
and hear the praise from their Lord :
“Well done, thou good and faithful
servant, thou hast been faithful over
a few things, I will make thee ruler
over many things, enter thou into the
joy of thy Lord.”
The Apostle Paul, in reference to
the work of the apostles and leaders
of the Christian Church, writes to the
Corinthians (1 Corinthians 4:1, 2):
“Let a man so account of us, as of
the ministers of Christ, and stewards
of the mysteries of God, Moreover,
it is required in stewards that a man
be found faithful”; and in the latter
part of the fifth verse, referring to
the coming of the Lord, he adds “And
then shall every man have praise
of God.”
He, who has been taken from us, was
called in early life to dedicate him-
self to God; responding, he was
chosen for the work of the “minister
of Christ, and steward of the mys-
teries of God, ’ ’ and the universal
testimony of those who knew him de-
clares to us, who also are witnesses
of the fact, that he was faithful.
Therefore, he is “with the Lamb.”
“Called and chosen and faithful.”
May God help us to gain spiritual
profit, as we improve the occasion of
our friend’s promotion to the higher
sphere of eternal service.
(1) He was called.
Mr. Newman was born of English
parentage at Alberton, near Port


Adelaide, South Australia, in the year
1841, but was brought up at Thebar-
ton to which place his parents had
removed. Surrounded by Christian
influences, and prepared by instruc-
tion at home and in the Sabbath
School, he gave himself to God in a
“gracious revival of religion which
broke out in our school.” I give his
own words: “A great change,” he
said, “took place in my character.
I can mind it well. It was
on a Sunday afternoon. I can also
well mind my beloved friend, Mr.
Gillingham, coming and asking me if
I would give my heart to God. The
question was too pointed for me to re-
sist. There were several at this time
under conviction of sin and seeking
mercy. Our beloved Superintendent
and Mr. Gillingham (the Secretary)
both came and pointed me to the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sins of the world. All this was at a
Prayer Meeting after School. There
were several of us that were convinced
of sin that afternoon; but none of us,
as well as I can mind, found peace.
On the Monday evening following we
had another Prayer Meeting, at which
Mr. Novis and Mr. Gillingham were
the leaders. The same gracious influ-
ences were poured forth as were on
the previous day. I, to the joy of
my soul, though so young, knew I was
happy, and could pray to God and
praise His name.” Immediately, a
Class Meeting was formed for the
young converts, and they also attend-
ed the weekly Prayer Meeting.


Here is a lesson of encouragement
for Sunday School teachers. With
wise zeal and intense love let personal
appeals be made for the surrender to
Christ of those of tender years. It is
said that Matthew Henry was con-
verted at the age of 11, Dr. Watts
wdien 9 years old, Jonathan Edwards
when 8, Richard Baxter at 6.
Henceforth, signs of growth in
grace and character were noted. He
sought God’s approval, and was only
happy when he felt he was follow-
ing Christ. At the age of 18 he was
actively engaged in Sunday School
and Church work. His first appear-
ance before a public audience was
when he, as Secretary, read the
School Report at an Anniversary
Public Meeting. Fitting and grati-
fying is it, that one of his sons should
be the Superintendent of our own
Sunday School, and another the Sec-
retary. To them “his memory is
blessed. ’ ’
He was keenly interested in the
Wesleyan Methodist cause at Thebar-
ton, and was the chief agent in build-
ing a new Church —giving up the
most of a year from his business to
this purpose.
In commercial life he was consci-
entious and energetic, and gave his
employers every satisfaction in his
able management of the particular
branch he was engaged in. An in-
sight into the cause of this is shown
by an extract from his diary, in which
he wrote on one occasion, “I have
discovered that I made a mistake in


an invoice of some goods which I had
made out, and it caused me great
trouble of mind; but I find it was for
my good, for I was not depending on
that assistance from the Almighty
which I ought to have done. The re-
mainder of the day I have had Christ
with me, and that to bless. ’ ’
He was called not only to Sunday
School work, but to preach, and be-
came an “effective local preacher,
sought for in other departments of
the work, and a leading spirit in the
suburban Church to which he be-
longed.”
(2) He was chosen to he a Minister
of Christ, and a “dispenser to Cod’s
household of His revealed truths.”
Dr. Burgess, in writing of Mr.
Newman, points out that “such a
man could not fail to become a can-
didate for the ministry. ’ ’ He did not
enter into this high calling as a pro-
fession, or for what he could get out
of it. When it was reported that he
thought of offering himself for the
Methodist ministry, he was remon-
strated with, because it was thought
he would be wasting his business
abilities. He does not tell us this
himself, but gives us a clear account
of his being “chosen” for the sacred
calling. When God, by His Spirit,
placed His band upon this young ser-
vant, had be refused, I believe he
would have become either (1) a fail-
ure in all his undertakings, or (2)
a pushing, successful business man
with a hard, unsympathetic heart.


And one could not imagine Mr. New-
man unsympathetic, hard, and un-
happy. Let him tell himself of his
choice. And Ido hope, that in all he
says to us to-night, we shall profit.
On the 31st October, 1858, he
writes that he had of late been the
subject of very singular impressions
to this effect, that the Lord intended
to make him a preacher of the Gos-
pel. He tried to get rid of this for
two reasons (1) that it might be only
the mere fancy of youth, and (2) that
it might be from hearing of the popu-
larity of others. He adds, that if it
should be the case that the Lord in-
tended to make him a preacher of the
Gospel, ‘ ‘ May the Lord give me grace
suitable, for His name’s sake. Amen.”
In November of the same year he
writes of the deepening impression,
and again in December. Six years
after this we find the following en-
try: “April Bth, 1865. By God’s
grace I am here at Wallaroo to enter
upon the important duties of the
Christian ministry. I left home yes-
terday morning, and arrived here at
9 o’clock at night. I feel humbled
very much. I know lam not worthy
of the position the Church has assign-
ed me; but, by God’s grace, I am
determined to do my best.”
The seal was given to his ministry
in the first year of his probation,
when many were converted. The Rev.
R. S. Casely writes that “there was
an increase of 152 members in the
year, and in the following year a fur-
ther increase of 78, shewing that the
8


revival spirit prevailed after his
term in the Circuit had ended, and, he
had received another appointment.”
Dr. Burgess, who occupied an ad-
jacent Circuit during part of his pro-
bation, writes: “He took charge with
his wonted energy. His ministry was
greatly blessed, congregations were
increased, converts multiplied, and
churches had to be enlarged.” The
reality of the call, the truth that he
had been chosen, was thus proved by
the grace of his character, the gifts
of his preaching and administration,
and the fruits to his labours.
(3) He was faithful.
All through his life he considered
the Christian ministry as the most
sacred of callings. His stewardship
of God’s mysteries was the first
and foremost consideration. He was
true to his colours, and this fidelity
and integrity made him the happy
man he was. Not that he was self-
centred, or regardless of the inter-
ests of others; but he had the joy of
the Lord within. He had the cour-
age necessary to fidelity. This was
shown in his attitude on the Sabbath
question, and his active interest in
the cause of Temperance.
A soldier died on the battlefield,
holding the colours aloft and saying,
“The colours have not touched the
ground, boys.” In this age of com-
promise, and broad views on most
questions, Mr. Newman was true to
his colours. He never “trailed them
nn the ground.” No one was more


sympathetic with the young, more
happy in their enjoyments, and yet
he was strong in his convictions con-
cerning what some call harmless, but
what he saw to be, harmful pleasures.
He was very firm when anyone wish-
ed to step over the line.
He was loyal to the evangelical
principles which had done so much
in forming his character. He was
loyal to Christ. The following is a
quotation from his diary:—
Anger and sloth and desire and pride
This moment be subdued,
Be cast into the crimson tide
Of my Redeemer’s blood.
He had no doubts as to the truth
uttered by Peter, “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God.”
The Rev. C. H. Ingamells says:
“He was distinctly evangelistic in his
method of preaching and work, and
in different periods of his ministry
he was very successful in winning
souls for Christ ’’; and the Rev. W. A.
Langsford writes that “His purpose
might be truly expressed in the verse:
44 1 want an even strong desire,
I want a calmly fervent seal
To save poor souls out of the fire,
To snatch them from the verge of hell,
And turn them to a pardoning God,
And quench the brands in Jesus ’ blood. ’ ’
He held to the great central truths
of the Christian religion with ever-
deepening conviction: the fall of man,
his need of a Saviour, the redemp-
tion of the world by Jesus Christ, the
full and free provisions of God’s
grace.


A member of this congregation lias
favoured me with a few extracts from
some of his latest deliverances. Take
one or two: “The more we profess
this blessed Christ the more do we feel
His encircling arms.” “Christ meas-
ures our life not by the length of it,
but by the quality, the goodness of
it.” “If your manhood is to be po-
tent in putting down wrong-doing,
then you must have the courage of
your convictions. There must be no
fear before evil or evil-doers. Stand
loyally by the truth and God, even if
it means death.” “Whatever stands
in the way when you are called upon
by Jesus Christ the Saviour, give it
up; to refuse involves your destiny. ’ ’
He was always rejoiced to hear of
conversions. Why should it be said
that evangelical truth is narrow?
Never was a more false statement
made. I remember we were talking
one day, and he said: “We must
make ourselves acquainted with mod-
ern thought, and this will not inter-
fere with our loyalty to Christ.”
When this Church was erected, he said
it would not be consecrated until there
were conversions in it. In the ser-
vices held during the Chapman-Alex-
ander Mission by Mr. Davies several
were brought to God, and he then re-
marked: “Now the building is con-
secrated.” Thank God others have
found Christ in this Church since
then. May many more be born with-
in these walls. Why not some to-
night ?


Only a short time ago Mr. New-
man’s heart was gladdened by a let-
ter received from the Rev. W. G.
Taylor, which stated that he (Mr.
Taylor) had met with an elderly lady
on board the ship he was travelling
in, who had told him that, many
years ago, she and some of her friends
were converted at a special mission
conducted by Mr. Newman in South
Australia, and that ail had maintain-
ed their sense of acceptance with God.
He was faithful to the Church and
her ordinances and institutions. He
believed in the Church’s mission, and
could have said with Dryden:
41 ’Tis said with ease, but never can be
proved.
The Church her old foundations has re-
moved,
And built new doctrines on unstable sands;
Jrodge that, ye winds and rains,
You proved her, yet she stands.”
He could never understand how men
and women could leave the Church
for the sake of social advancement,
or because their positions in the world
had improved. Such cases always
aroused his spirit into righteous in-
dignation.
Being a loyal Methodist, he loved
the Fellowship Meetings of his
Church. It was he who commenced
the Monday night Society Class in
connection with this Church, and it
was with tender sympathy that he
always gave wise counsel. Some of
his own family have been members
of that class since its formation. A


favourite Class Meeting hymn was
No. 588, beginning,
4 4 Oh thou who earnest from above
The pure celestial fire to impart,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
On the mean altar of my heart.”
In South Australia and in New
South Wales he gave himself unsel-
fishly, with whole-heartedness, to help
his Church. Let the resolution passed
at the South Australian Conference
tell of his faithful work in that State.
“The Rev. C. T. Newman has been
for many years one of the leaders of
our Israel. As President of the Con-
ference, as Book Steward, Connexion-
al Editor, and Treasurer of various
Connexional Funds, he has rendered
services, the value of which is beyond
all computation. By his consistent
life, his earnest preaching, his faith-
ful discharge of pastoral duty for 37
years, his wise administration of Con-
nexional affairs, he has won for him-
self the esteem and love of our
people.”
Here in New South Wales he has
left an abiding influence in the Cir-
cuits in which he laboured, and
the many resolutions passed by stand-
ing vote in so many Committees, show
how his services for Home and For-
eign Missions, and for the educa-
tional and evangelistic work of the
Church, were appreciated. It was his
joy to see this beautiful Church erect-
ed to the glory of God, and to estab-
lish the cause at Concord. His last


public act was to join with me in ad-
ministering the Sacrament in this
Church on the morning of August 6th.
How sympathetic, helpful, and loyal
he was to me! How he encouraged
the young ministers who preceded me!
The Rev. Harry Price has written
me, “He was a good man and did me
many kindnesses. ’ ’
Outside of Methodism too he was
actively interested in all philanthropic
agencies. The New South Wales
Temperance Alliance, the Young
Men’s Christian Association and the
Young Women’s Christian Associa-
tion, and any organization which had
for its aim the uplifting of humanity,
claimed his earnest and judicious and
willing assistance.
Faithful, too, was he in his family
relationships. The home life is too
sacred for us to enter, but we may
say that he fulfilled the best ideals
of the husband and father. Of him
it may be truly said: “A good man
leaveth an inheritance to his child-
ren’s children.” “The memory of
the just is blessed.” His memory is
blessed, and his influence in the home,
gracious, sweet, and strong, will
never be forgotten.
In his last illness—so unexpected
and terminating so suddenly—the
qualities of his character and disposi-
tion, and his complete trust in God,
were manifested. He was unselfish
to those who helped him in his pain,
and always tried to make their
work light. We need no last words
to prove to us his hold upon Christ,


but we take comfort to ourselves in
the memory of what he uttered out
of the fulness of his life and heart.
One day he said in the presence of
his wife and nurse: “The grace of
God is marvellous,” when his wife
said, “to help”? he answered, “Yes.”
Again “Jesus loves you, He is with
you,” was said to him, and when
asked did he realize it, he answered,
“Immensely, immensely, the love of
Jesus, who can tell”? When his wife
sang, “Jesus lover of my soul,” he
spoke of the hymn in terms which
showed how dear it was to him. Dur-
ing Sunday, 20th August, he mur-
mured to himself, “The peace of
God,” and his wife added: “Which
passeth all understanding,” where-
upon, a beautiful look of trust came
into his eyes.
While the Sunday School in which
he was so interested was in session,
he left earth for Heaven.
His was not an unfinished life,
rather could he say with Paul, “I
have fought the good fight, I have fin-
ished the course, I have kept the
faith. Henceforth, there is laid up
for me the crown of Righteousness,
which the Lord —the Righteous
Judge—shall give to me at that day. ’ 1
In faithfulness he had been great.
His fidelity had “blossomed” into
influence. His integrity brought him
happiness. That life is a finished life,
which has been lived in accordance
with the will of God. A life spent in
the service of Christ and the Church,


in unselfish consideration for the
home and the community, is a life
that does not die. The immortality
of his influence remains with us. He
is with the Lamb, his King.
For ourselves shall we not say
with Tennyson:
*' Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me,
And may there he no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,
But such a tide as, moving, seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the bound-
less deep
Turns again home.”
And concerning him,
Servant of God, well done,
Best from thy loved employ.
The battle fought, the victory icon,
Enter thy Master’s joy.
Soldier of Christ, well done,
Praise be thy new employ;
And while eternal ages run,
Best in thy Savio-ur’s joy.
To the bereaved, our hearts go out
in deepest sympathy. We commend
them to God, and pray that He will
speak peace to their troubled hearts.
-Amen,
