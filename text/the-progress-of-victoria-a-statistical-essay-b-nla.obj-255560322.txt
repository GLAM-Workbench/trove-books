PREFACE.
The present Essay on the Progress of Victoria is an enlargement of the
editions of 18G1 and 1867, and brings statistical information generally
up to the end of 1871, and in some instances as far as 1872.
Much care has been exercised in checking and revising the previous
compilations, as well as in bringing the figures, as far as possible, to
date, and in carrying out this task I have much pleasure in recognising
the valuable aid rendered by Mr. Hayter, the Senior Clerk, and other
officers of the Statistic Branch of this Department.
Registrar-General’s Office, Melbourne,
IJfth February, 1873.


PROGRESS OF VICTORIA.
The statistical records of Australia are not excelled either in
fulness or in accuracy by those of any other country; and as the
statistical system initiated in Melbourne in 1853 is gradually
being followed by statisticians in surrounding states, there is every
reason to hope that, at no distant date, thorough unity will exist
both of purpose and of action in relation to all the leading lines
of statistical work throughout Australasia.* The present essay is
limited to the progress of Victoria, and will serve, in a hand-book
form, both as a summary of and as a companion to. the folio
volume of statistics annually published by the Victorian Govern-
ment.
GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF VICTORIA
2. Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of
Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south
latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its
extreme length from east to west is about 420 miles, and its
greatest breadth is about 260 miles. Its extent of coast line is
nearly 600 miles.
BOUNDARIES.
3. It is bounded on the west by the colony of South Australia,
the dividing line being approximately the 141st meridian, upon
which the division between Victoria and South Australia was
originally laid out in accordance with astronomical results obtained
at the time. The extension of the trigonometrical survey to the
western boundary shows that it is in longitude 140° 58' 7'26" E.,
where the triangulation is connected with it, near the coast. On
the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by the colony of
New South Wales, from which it is separated by the River Murray,
and an imaginary line reaching from the head waters of that
stream at Forest Hill to Cape Howe. The boundary line between
Victoria and New South Wales has now been surveyed and marked
by the geodetic surveyors. Its north-west starting point is a
* In the month of October, 1861, representatives of New South Wales, South
Australia, and Queensland were authorised to proceed to Melbourne, and confer
•with the Registrar-General of Victoria on the existing methods of collecting and
tabulating statistical data, in order to determine how far closer uniformity and
united action might be developed for the future. The latest effort by the colonies
in regard to unity of time was the simultaneous taking of the census in April, 1871,
by New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria.
A 2


place called “The Springs,” on Forest Hill, in latitude 36° 47'
56 - 9" S., longitude 148° 11/ 57 '75" E. This is the nearest point of
the sources of the Murray to Cape Howe. The line runs from
that point in a south easterly direction to Cape Howe, latitude
37° 30' 2309" S., longitude 149° 58' 35*5" E. The line marked is
109'551 miles in length, according to the Government Astronomer
of Victoria, Mr. Ellery. The shores of Victoria on the south and
south-east are washed by the Southern Ocean.
MISLEADING NOMENCLATURE OF A NEIGHBOURING COLONY.
4. In consequence of its position at the extreme south of the
Australian continent, Victoria is often mistaken by English
writers, and others not well acquainted with Australian geo-
graphy, for the colony which is topographically misnamed Soutlr
Australia; the truth being that only a very small part of South
Australia is situated farther south than even the most northern
portion of Victoria.
5. The southernmost point in Victoria, and consequently in the
whole of Australia, is Wilson’s Promontory, which lies in lat.
39° 7' S., long. 146° 26' E. ; the northernmost point is the place
where the western boundary of the colony intersects the Murray,
lat. 34° S., long. 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe,
situated in lat. 37° 30' S., long. 149° 59' E.; the most westerly
point is in the line of the whole western frontier, which, according
to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and
extends from lat. 34° S. to lat. 38° 4' S., or more than 240 miles.
GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF MELBOURNE.
6. Prior to the establishment of a Government Observatory,
the point of observation chosen to indicate the position of
Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, was Batman’s Hill, an elevation
at the western end of the city, which has since been cut away in
order to afford station accommodation for the Victorian Railways.
The latitude of the site of Batman’s Hill* has been determined to
be 37° 49' 23" S. Its longitude was formerly received as 144° 58'
15’6" E., but Mr. C. J. Tyers, Commissioner of Crown Lands,
Gippsland, forwarded a memorandum to His Excellency C. J.
Latrobe, on the 6th December, 1853, by which he showed that,
using the meridian distance between Fort Macquarie, at Sydney
(the longitude of which had been determined by numerous
observations), and Batman’s Hill, the true longitude of the latter
should be 144° 58' 35" E., or twenty seconds to the eastward of
* See Archer’s Statistical Register of Victoria, pp. 1 and 2. Ferres, Mel-
bourne, 1854.


f Mr. Ellery says, “ The position of the Williamstown Observatory was
finally
determined from astronomical observation in 1862, and the position
of the
Melbourne Observatory has been deduced therefrom by triangulation. The follow-
ing are the respective longitudes;—
Williamstown Observatory 144° 54' 45" B.
,, Lighthouse 144° 54' 55 - 5" E.
Melbourne Observatory 144° 58' 42" E.
what was previously supposed. Mr. Tyers subsequently furnished
■a statement of its longitude, deduced from calculations on the
annular eclipse of the sun of Ist February, 1851, observed at
Parramatta by the late Rear-Admiral King; at the Government
Observatory, Hobart Town, by Captain Kay, R.N.; and at
Batman’s Hill, Melbourne, by Messrs. Groves and Robertson.*
The following are the results :
Annular Eclipse of the Sun, Ist February, 1851, observed by Long, of Batman’s
the late Rear-Admiral King, at bis Observatory, Parramatta, Hill,
lat. 33° 48' 50" S., long. 10b. 4m. 6 - 255. E., commenced at
4b. 6m. 6s. mean time 144° 58' 34" E.
Observed by Capt. Kay, R.N., at the Government Observatory,
Hobart Town, lat. 42° 52' S., long. 9b. 49m, 30s. E., com-
menced 3h. 30m. 9s. mean time; alt. 41° 19' 144° 58' o’7" E.
•Observed by Messrs. Groves and Robertson, at Batman’s Hill,
Melbourne, commenced at 3b. 27m. 55 - 7 s. meantime; alt.43° 144° 58' 52" E.
The mean of these three observations gives the longitude of
Batman’s Hill as 144° 58' 28‘9" E.
7. The first site on which an astronomical observatory was
-erected in Victoria was in Williamstown. This took place in
1853. Nine years afterwards (in 1862) the staff of this establish-
ment, and that of the magnetic and meteorological observatory
established in 1858, under Professor Neumayer, were amalga-
mated and transferred to the present Melbourne Observatory, a
new building situated in the Government reserve on the south
side of the Yarra, lat. 37° 49' 53" S., long. 144° 58' 42" E.-f*
AREA OF VICTORIA.
8. The area of Victoria, according to the latest computation, is
88,198 square miles, or 56,446,720 acres. The whole continent of
Australia is estimated to contain about 3,000,000 of square miles,
and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fifth part of its
surface. Great Britain, exclusive of the islands in the British
seas, contains 89,644 square miles, and is therefore slightly larger
than Victoria.
* See Results of Meteorological Observations , taken in the Colony of Victoria,
1859-1862, p. 11, by George Neumayer. Ferres, Melbourne, 1864.
The Australian Directory (Admiralty), vol. i., pp. 516 and 517, points out that our
longitude is about the mean of the longitudes given by Stokes, Stanley, and Yule.”
J The area of Great Britain, inclusive of islands, is 90,038 square miles, which is
made up as follows ; —England, 50,922 square miles ; Wales, 7,398 square miles ;
Scotland, 31,324 square miles; Islands in the British Seas, 394 square miles. (See
Report upon the Census of Great Britain , 1851, p. Ivi.)


MOUNTAINS.
9. Victoria, is traversed with more or less regularity throughout
its whole length by a chain of hills completely dividing it into
two parts, and thence called the Dividing Range. This range
runs in an east and west direction, generally at a distance of 60
or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it run
towards the Murray, those to the south of it towards the sea.
The eastern part of it, which divides the Gipps Land district from
that of the Murray, is called the Australian Alps, and that part
which separates the Wimmera district from the county of Ripon,
is called the Pyrenees. There are also other ranges extending in
different parts of the country, many of which are offshoots of
the main chain. The principal are the Benambra and the Gibbo
ranges, in the county of Benambra; the Bogong range, in the
county of Bogong; the Buffalo range, in the county of Delatite;
the Putter range, in the counties of Delatite and Moira; the Baw
Baw range dividing the counties of Evelyn and Buln Buln; the
Hoddle range, in the county of Buln Buln; Mount Delegete, in
the county of Croagingolong; Mount Wellington, in Wonnan-
gatta; Mount Alexander, in the county of Talbot; the Grampians,
in the county of Boning; the Victoria and Serra ranges, in the
counties of Dundas and Ripon.
10. A list of the mountains and hills in Victoria, showing also
the counties in which they are situated, and the elevation of the
principal peaks above the level of the sea, recently corrected by
Mr. Government Astronomer Ellery, and Mr. Surveyor-General
Skene, according to the latest information in the possession of
their respective departments, is given in Appendix A.
RIVERS.
11. The livers in Victoria are for the most part of inconsider-
able size. Many of them are liable to be partially dried up
during the summer months, so as to be reduced at that season to
mere chains of waterholes. With the exception of the Yarra, on
the-banks of which the metropolis is situated, the Goulburn, which
empties itself into the Murray about eight miles to the eastward
ofEchuca, and the Murray itself, with perhaps some of the Gipps
Land streams, not one of them is navigable, except by boats. As,
however, they drain the watershed of large areas of country, they
will ultimately be made feeders to permanent reservoirs for the
purposes of irrigation, gold washing, and manufactures.
12. The names of the principal rivers in Victoria, with their
positions and approximate lengths, originally supplied by the Sur-
vey Department, and recently corrected by Mr. Surveyor-General
Skene, according to the latest information, will be found in
Appendix B,


LAKES.
18. Victoria contains numerous salt and fresh water lakes and
lagoons, but many of these are little more than swamps during
dry seasons. Lake Corangamite (counties Grenville and Hamp-
den), the largest inland lake in the colony, covers 1 6 squaie
miles, and is quite salt, notwithstanding its augmentation by
numerous fresh-water streams. It has no visible outlet. Lake
Colac (county Polwarth), only a few miles distant from Lake
Corangamite, is a beautiful sheet of water, 10 squaie miles in
extent and quite fresh. Lake Burrumbeet, in the county of
Rip on, is also a fine sheet of fresh water, embracing an area of 81-
square miles. The Gipps Land lakes —Victoria and King, both in
the county of Tangil, are situated close to the coast, and aie onl_\
separated from the sea by a narrow belt of sand. Through this
there is an entrance, which is often navigable, but is subject t<>
be closed at irregular intervals, in consequence of the shifting of
the sand at its mouth. Lake Wellington (county Tangil), the
largest of all the Gipps Land lakes, lies to the westward of Lakes
Victoria and Reeve (county Buln Buln), and is connected with
the first-named by a narrow channel.
14 A list of the lakes in Victoria, with their localities and
areas, corrected to latest date, has been supplied by the Sui\ey
Department, and will be found in Appendix C.
CLIMATE.
15. From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate
far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the
continent of Australia, as within a comparatively limited aiea it
possesses the climatic advantages of the more favoured portions of
Southern Europe. Marseilles, Bordeaux, Boulogne, Nice, V erona,
and Madrid, are on or near the isothermal line corresponding with
that of the southern hemisphere passing through Melbourne, but
the difference between summer and winter is far less in that city
than in the places mentioned, and the climate is consequently
more agreeable. Professor Neumayer determines Mafra feet
above the sea (8 miles N.W, of Lisbon, and in latitude 38 55 IS.)
to be a locality experiencing mean temperatures for the different
seasons very near to those obtaining in Melbourne. The diffeience
in mean of summer and winter temperatures in Melbourne, from
a series of observations extending over fourteen years, is IGT
degrees ;in Alberton, Ik4, and in Portland, 11 3. These all lie
along the coast. Inland the difference is much greater, as for
example—Ararat, 21*2 ; Beechworth, 24’9 ; Castlemaine, 211 ;
Heathcote 22‘8.

16. The importance of the mean temperature of the seasons
being distinguished, instead of relying on simple mean annual
temperatures, is illustrated in the case of Beechworth. Although
this town is situated a degree and a half north of Melbourne
inland, and while it exhibits about the same mean annual tem-
perature as that of Melbourne (57‘5), yet in the summer month of
January the thermometer is on the average about 3 degrees
higher than at Melbourne, and in February and March about
4 degrees higher. On the other hand, in the winter month of
July the temperature is 7 degrees lower, in August 4 - 6°, and in
September 6’2° lower.* Much has yet to be learned of the
climatic conditions of Victoria, especially in the mountain regions,
but as the country becomes gradually opened up by railway and
other enterprise, it is reasonable to believe that many a spot will
become famous as a place of resort for healthful relaxation, which
now lies altogether unknown.
17. The following table gives, during each of the last fourteen
years, the highest, lowest, and mean temperature in the shade,
and the mean atmospheric pressure (both calculated from a
reduced mean corresponding with that of 24 hourly observations
taken each day) ;*f* also, the number of days on which rain fell,
* See Table 1., in Ellery’s Notes on the Climate of Victoria, Intercolonial Ex-
hibition Essays, 1866-7.
f Until September, 1862, the readings were at the Flagstaff Observatory, which
is 120'7 feet above the level of the sea. After that period the readings were at the
Melbourne Observatory, which is 91-3 feet above the sea level. An addition of
0-029 inches requires to be made to the barometrical observations at the former
place to make them comparable with those at the latter. With respect to compari-
sons generally between country and country in relation to climate, it is greatly to
be desired that some uniform standard should be adopted of determining the
daily thermometrical, barometrical, and other means. The varying modes now

18. Thermometrical observations in the shade have been made
in Melbourne over the last 30 years. From 1842-1858 the gross
mean was 57 6°. From hourly observation in 1858, 1859, and
I<B6o, it was found to be 57’82°, while the gross mean of fourteen
years, 1858-71, in the above table, is 57’5°.
19. Ice is occasionally seen during the winter months. The
number of frosts in different parts of the country of course differs
according to the elevation above the sea level, and other local
circumstances. Professor Neumayer states that the average
number of frosts is 35 at Heath cote, 16 at Ballarat, and 11 at
Beechworth.F
HOTTEST AND COLDEST MONTHS.
20. The hottest month in Melbourne is January, the mean
temperature being 60‘6 degrees over a period of fourteen years;
and the coldest, July, in which the mean temperature during the
same period was 47’8 degrees. The atmospheric pressure is
greatest in April, May, and June, the average in each during
adopted in all parts of the world render it very difficult to ascertain how far the
climate of one locality is comparable with that of another, and hence I have
mentioned the fact that the Melbourne observations, being calculated from a
reduced mean, correspond with that of 24 hourly observations taken daily.

fourteen years being over 30 inches; and least in December and
January, about 29 - 8 inches. Most rainy days occur in September,
and fewest in March, the average numbers in those months being
respectively 157 and 7'3. The greatest volume of rain falls, on
the average, in October, the mean for that month extending over
fourteen years being 3T7 inches; and the smallest in March, for
which the mean was To inch. The air is moistest in June and
July and driest in January, the mean relative humidity over
fourteen years being ‘Bl in the former and '64 in the latter
month, it being understood that the unit is indicative of complete
saturation. These results, and the averages of the same
elements for the remaining months, will be found by reference to
the following table:—

Point of saturation considered to be 1.
21. By the observations made at the Flagstaff Observatory, Mel-
bourne, during the six years 1846-1851, both inclusive, the
mean temperature in the shade was 59’02°, or one degree and a
half less than the mean of the 14 years in the preceding table.
The barometrical mean was nearly the same, 29'960 inches; while
the mean amount of rainfall for six years was 30-852 inches, or
upwards of five inches per annum in excess. The extraordinary
fall of November, 1849, namely, 1213 inches, is not included in
this mean.*

The heat experienced durir
above indicated, is a dry heat,
that which is known in End
during the few days in each year, as
heat, and is much more endurable than
in England as a “ muggy heat ” of much
lower temperature. It is only during the prevalence of the “ hot
winds” that the above high rates of temperature are felt, and their
frequency varies in different districts. Neumayer states the
average number in the year at Melbourne and Castlemaine to be
14; at Sandhurst, Heathcote, and Portland 11 ; at Beech-
worth, Ararat, and Swan Hill, 8; at Geelong and Ballarat, 6 ;
and at Alberton and Camperdown, 3. Every place has its climatic
drawbacks. Athens has its air 100° in the shade, and even
Madeira has its Leste wind, the very counterpart of our Aus-
tralian brickhelder. Our hot winds, to say the least, are not more
oppressive than many a sultry day in Northern Europe,

POPULATION.
Settlement of Port Phillip in 1835.
24. Upwards of a generation has passed away since a small
craft, aptly named “ The Enterprise,” was moored fast to some
trees on the banks of the Yarra, at the foot of a well-grassed hill.
The hill, called Pleasant Hill* by the new comers, has disappeared;
but the little companionhood of fourteen souls borne by that craft
in August, 1835, has widened into a people.-f* The following
table, deduced from private as well as public records, shows the

BIRTHPLACES OF THE PEOPLE
25. Many of the present inhabitants of Victoria, as is well
known, have found their way hither from other parts of the
globe, and the relative proportion of different nationalities one to
another has naturally changed from time to time with the varying
streams of immigration. The English born were, however, fore-
most in the list of nationalities at every census taking until
that of 1871, when they were found to be more than doubled by
young Australia.
* Subsequently named Batman’s Hill. It has since been cut down by the sharp
edge of commercial activity for railway purposes.
j- Although the Henty family had made a private settlement at the extreme
west of the colony (Portland) a few months before, yet the awakening of the public
mind to the advantages of the Port Phillip district as a new country, appears to
have been mainly due to the adventurous zeal, first of Batman and then of
Fawkner in 1835, and of Major Mitchell in 1836.
J The figures here given for 1872 are an estimate only. Estimates of population
are made up quarterly in the Registrar-General’s department, from the records of
births and deaths and of arrivals and departures. By this means the gross
numbers 8f both sexes are approximately determined.


IRISH BORN COMPARED WITH ENGLISH BORN.
26. In 1846 there were (within a thousand) as many inhabi-
tants of Irish birth as of English birth—viz., 9126 Irish born to
10,100 English born. Five years later (in 1851) the numbers
had changed to 14,618 Irish born against 28,908 English born—
that is to say, the Irish born, instead of showing in 1851 as in
1846 nearly an equality in number to the English born, presented
a proportion equal to scarcely a half; and the latter proportion
was found to subsist between the two nationalities, ten years
later, at the census-taking of 1861. Ten years later still, viz., at
the census of 1871, the Irish born were found to have gained on
the English born, and stood to them in the proportion of 3 to 5.
SCOTCH BORN COMPARED WITH ENGLISH BORN.
27. Again, the Scotch born, as compared with the English born,
stood in 1846 in the proportion of 4225 to 10,100, or about 42 per
cent, of those of English birth; but in no subsequent census has
so high a proportion obtained. In 1861 the Scotch born showed
60,701 to 169,586, or but little more than a third of the English
born, and in 1871 they showed respectively 56,210 and 164,287,
the Scotch being still equal in number to rather more than a third
of the English.
SCOTCH BORN COMPARED WITH IRISH BORN.
28. On comparing the Scotch born with the Irish born, very
remarkable differences appear at the census periods. In 1846 the
Irish born were as 9126 to 4225, or more than double the Scotch
born, but in 1854 the Irish born were very little ahead of the
Scotch born—that is to say, there were 39,728 Irish to 36,044
Scotch. Since that period, however, the Irish born have gained
numerically upon the Scotch born, the relative numbers in 1861
being 87,160 of Irish birth to 60,701 of Scotch birth, and at the-
last census, that of 1871, as many as 100,468 of Irish birth existed
to only 56,210 of Scotch birth.
WELSH BORN AND FOREIGNERS.
29. The Welsh, in 1871, formed a very small portion of the
population, less than one per cent. only. Foreigners on the other
hand were in the proportion of about five per cent, of the total
population; but out of the 37,315, which was the sum total of
foreigners, 17,826 were Chinese, or one in every 41 of the popula-
tion. The next most numerous race were the Germans, who
numbered 9,264, or one in every 79 living. The Americans
numbered 2423, and the French 1170.

INCREASE AND DECREASE OF CERTAIN NATIONALITIES.
30. It is worthy of remark that persons horn in all countries
outside the Australian colonies, except the Welsh and Irish,
decreased in Victoria between the censuses of 1861 and 1871.
The increase of the Welsh was from 6065 to 6614, or about 9 per
cent., and that of the Irish was from 87,160 to 100,468, or more
than 15 per cent. The English decreased at the rate of 3 per
cent, the Scotch at the rate of 7| per cent., the persons born in
British colonies other than the Australian at the rate of 11 per
cent., the French at the rate of 6| per cent., the Germans at the
rate of 11 per cent., the persons born in other European countries
at the rate of 10| per cent., the Americans at the rate of 5 per
cent., the Chinese at the rate of nearly 28 per cent., and those born
in other countries out of Europe at the rate of 22| per cent.

OUR RISING RACE.
CHANGE OF TYPE BY PROCESS OF MARRIAGE.
81. Consequent upon the diversity of nationality existing
-amongst us, there is a very important change of type continually
.going on by process of marriage. This change, though hitherto
little heeded by those effecting it, is one that will enduringly
influence every social and political development of our future
national life.
82. It would not be convenient here to enter at length into
anything like an ethnological discussion. What is or is not a
pure race, and who are members of it, are very difficult questions
to answer in regard to large sections of the British people. For,
in spite of the common expressions of broad distinction in use
among natives of the United Kingdom, such as “ Saxon” and
“Celt,” the inhabitants generally of both Great Britain and
Ireland cannot be truthfully arranged under such simple divisions,
and assertions of purity of race are consequently apt to prove
baseless when submitted to the hard pressure of historical tests.
There are, however, as everybody knows, striking distinctive
characteristics in the general 'physique and character of English,
Irish, and Scotch people. The comers to Victoria, of course,
brought these characteristics with them. They are the result of
difference of origin, of temperament, of climate, of soil, of occu-
pation, of social institutions, of laws, of religion, and of being kept
apart.
AN AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.
83. In this country, close proximity, as well as the consequent
intimate family alliances which affection and interest are every
day powerfully cementing among the living representatives in
Australia of the three great peoples just named, is rapidly
breaking down the old barriers to unity; and just as in the past
there have been produced the English people, the Irish people,
and the Scotch people, as we now see them, so will another national
type be developed in the shape of an Australian people, whose
destiny, I trust, it will be to show, that, as they are the latest, so
will they prove the wisest, best, and happiest among the nations.
INEQUALITY IN NUMBER OF THE SEXES IN VICTORIA.
34. Equality in number of the sexes is one of the first condi-
tions necessary for the development in a nation of its full healthy
force of national growth; but there has always hitherto obtained
a great disproportion in this regard in Victoria. For example, in
the year 1838 there were but 14 females to every 100 males;
but at the census of 1871 there were 82'4 females to every
100 males; and at the end of September, 1872, it was estimated

that there were 83 females to every 100 males, which is a smaller
disproportion than has ever before existed. The greatest degree
of equality naturally exists among the Australian born. In 1871
the numbers of the sexes of Australian natives were nearly equal,
or 179,881 males to 178,385 females. The Irish born were in the
proportion of 104 females to 100 males; the Scotch in that of 79
females to 100 males; and the English in that of 68 females to
100 males. Among foreigners the French showed the highest
proportion of females—namely, 37 females to 100 males; the
Germans next—namely, 35 females to 100 males; and the
Chinese the least—namely, 1 female only to every 575 males.
NATIONALITIES OF THE MARRIED.
35. In order to determine, however, the extent to which
existing national types are being fused in Victoria, it is necessary
to ascertain the nationalities of the married. During the six
years just prior to the census of 1861, upwards of twenty-six
thousand marriages took place in Victoria; and in 25,908
instances the nationality of both parties was specified in the
registrar. In like manner, during the six years ending with that
of the census of 1871, 27,595 marriages with specified nationalities
were celebrated.
NATIONALITY OF HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
36. In the following tables will be found grouped 25,908
marriages, which took place in Victoria during the six years
1855-1860, and 27,595, Which took place in the six years 1866-
1871, together with the numbers of English, Irish, Scotch, Welsh,
Australians, Americans, Germans, Chinese, and natives of other
countries of either sex, and the nationalities with which they
respectively intermarried.

Table IX.— Nationality of Husbands and Wives in
Combination, 1866-1871.
(■Percentage of Males and Females of each Nationality.)
38. The last four tables being read in connection with each other,
show the following results : —Out of 25,908 males who were
married in Victoria during the six years 1855-1860, 12,664, or 49
six years 1855-1860, 12,664, or 49
per cent., were Englishmen, of whom 7152, or 561 per cent.,
married English women ; and, in the six years 1866-1871, 11,935,
or 43| per cent., of the males who married were English men, of
whom 6029, or 50|- per cent., married English women,
On the
other hand, out of 25,908 women who married in the first six
years named, 9718, or 371 per cent., were English, and of these
7152, or nearly 74 per cent., married English men; and, in the
second six years, out of 27,595 women who were married, 9299,
or 33| per cent., were English, of whom 6029, or nearly 65 per
cent., married English men. Again, as many as 3065, or nearly
10per cent, of the English men at the first period, and
1996, or over 11 per cent., at the second, married Irish women;
in striking contrast to which, only 573, or less than 6 per cent.,
at the former period, and 684, or 7} per cent., at the latter, of the


English women married Irish men. During the first years 4422
Irish men married the same number of Irish women, the former
being 80 per cent, of the Irish men, and the latter 48 per cent, of the
Irish women who married; and during the second six years 4290
Irish men married Irish women, the former being nearly 70 per
cent., and the latter being nearly 53 per cent., of the whole
number of Irish men and Irish women who married. Of 59
Chinese, all males, who married at the former period, 28, or 47|
per cent., married Irish women; 14, or 23| per cent., married
English women; 11, or 18| per cent., married Australian born
women; 2, or 3 2-5 per cent., married Scotch women, and the
same number and percentage married Welsh women and German
women; and of 99 Chinese males, who married during the latter
period, 49, or about half, married Australian women; 24, or
nearly a fourth, married English women; 16, or nearly a sixth,
married Irish women; 5, or about a twentieth, married Scotch
women; two, or about two per cent., married with Chinese
women, and the same number and proportion with women of
other countries; and one married with a German woman. In
like manner, the number of persons of either sex and of any
nationality, together with the nationality with which they
respectively intermarried, will be found in the first table, as may
also be found the proportions per cent, of those wdio married to
the respective nationalities of those with whom they intermarried,
in the second and third.
39. In the next two tables, the percentage of the various
intermarriages to the whole number of marriages is given, or the
number of each combination to every 100 marriages solemnised.

40. Tims, out of every 100 men who married at the first period,
49 were English, and at the second period 43| were English; out
of every 100 women who married at the first period 37| were
English, and at the second period 33f per cent, were English,
Out of every 100 marriages which took place at the first period
271 were between English males and English females; out of
every 100 at the second period 21f were between English
males and English females, and so on for all the other combina-
tions within the two periods.
41. Supposing unity of race and unity of nationality were
synonymous, the grouping of the 25,908 marriages from 1855-
1860 and of the 27,595 from 1866-1871 would indicate how far
such unity was being sustained by marriage alliance. This is
shown in the following table.

42. It will be observed that of the 25,908 marriages which
took place in the period 1855-1860 more than half per cent.)
were between persons of the same nationality, and of the 27,595
marriages which took place in the period 1866-1871 less than
half (481 per cent.) were between persons of the same
nationality. The marriage percentage of Australians with Aus-
tralians, it will be observed, has risen from a little over half
per cent, in 1855-1860, to 4 7 per cent, between 1866-1871; and,
of course, year by year this development will steadily go on, and
as the mixed race of Australian bom gradually assumes
numerical importance, it will become more and more difficult to
distinguish the national descent of any given portion of the
Victorian people.
CONJUGAL CONDITION.
43. The following table shows the conjugal condition of the
people of Victoria, of 15 years old and upwards, when the census
was taken on the 2nd April, 1871.
Table XIII. — Conjugal Condition, 1871.
EARLY MARRIAGES.
44. Under the age of 15, three girls were returned as wives
Between 15 and 20, 63 youths were returned as husbands, and 4
as widowers; at the same age 1810 females were returned as
wives, and 17 as widows.
HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
45. Of the whole population about 1 in 3 was living in the
married state; of every 1000 males of all ages 279 were husbands;
of every 1000 females, 338 were wives.
46. The proportion of husbands in every 1000 males of the age
of 15 and upwards was 453; the proportion of wives in every
1000 females at the same age was 629. Of males of 20 and
upwards, 507; and of females of 20 and upwards, 737 in every
1000 were married.
WIDOWERS AND WIDOWS.
47. Assuming each husband to represent a family, there were in
Victoria, when the census was taken, 111,182 integral families ;
but there were also 23,501 families in a state of dissolution,
namely, 13,683 by the death of the husband at their head, and


9818 by the death of the wife at their head, the former being the-
number of widows, and the latter the number of widowers returned.
48. The proportion of widowers to the male population waa
1 in 41 ; that of widows to the female population was 1 in 24.
The husbands were to the widowers in the proportion of 11 to
1; the wives to the widows were in the proportion of Bto 1. Of
men ol the age of 20 and upwards, lin 22 was a widower; of
women at the same age, 1 in 11 was a widow.
BACHELORS AND SPINSTERS.
49. If unmarried persons of the age of 15 and upwards are to
be termed bachelors and spinsters, Victoria contained, when the
census was taken, 122,605 of the former and 51,563 of the latter,
or 237 bachelors to 100 spinsters. If this designation be not
used until the parties have attained the age of 20, the numbers
would be 96,585 bachelors, and 25,202 spinsters, or 383 bachelors
to 100 spinsters. If 20 and upwards for males, and 15 and
upwards for females, be considered the marriageable ages, then
the proportions would be 187 bachelors to 100 spinsters. At the
census of 1861 there were as many as 326 bachelors to 100
spinsters at this period of life.
50. Of males at the age of 15 and upwards about half were
unmarried; unmarried females of 15 and upwards were in the
proportion of 291 in every 1000 females at the same age. At the
age of 20 and upwards, bachelors amounted to 441 in every 1000
of the male population; at the same age, unmarried females
amounted to 170 in 1000 of the female population, while at the
census of 1861 there were but 153 unmarried females of 20
and upwards out of 1000.
DENSITY OF THE POPULATION.
51. In 1861 there were in Victoria about 6 persons to the
square mile. In 1871 there were more than 8 persons to the
square mile. In New South Wales, according to the census of
1871, there was about persons to the square mile; and in
South Australia there was but three-fifths of a person to the
square mile. In England and Wales there were by the recent
census about 389 persons on the average to the square mile.
This allows If acres for each inhabitant of England and Wales,
whilst in Victoria there are 77 acres, in New South Wales 411
acres, and in South Australia 1058 acres for each individual.*
* The calculations in this paragraph have been made upon the following basis: —
England and Wales (1871) —Area, 58,320 square miles ; population, 22,704,108 ;
number of persons to the square mile, 389 - 302 ; number of acres to a person, 1-644.
Victoria—Area, 88,198 square miles; population, exclusive of persons in ships,
729,276 ; number of persons to the square mile, 8-27 ; number of acres to a person,
77T62. New South Wales —Area, 323,437 square miles ; population, 503,981 ;
number of persons to a square mile, L 558 ; number of acres to a person, 410 - 729.
South Australia—Area, 312,500 square miles; population, 188,995; number of
persons to the square mile, '605 ; number of acres to a person, 1058'229.


52. Of course the population is not everywhere of equal
density. While the large towns and goldfields are, comparatively
speaking, thickly peopled, the agricultural districts are less so,
and the pastoral districts still less so, while beyond these there
are large tracts of country which are not even yet fully explored.
The colony is now divided into 37 counties.* The most thickly-
peopled of these at the census of 1871 was the metropolitan
county, Bourke, with over 13G inhabitants to the square mile ;*
the next was Talbot, containing Chines, Castlemaine, Creswick,
Daylesford, Maryborough, Amherst, Maldon, and other important
goldfields, with 52 inhabitants to the square mile; then Grenville,
containing the city of Ballarat, and the chief portion of the
Ballarat and several other goldfields, with 41 persons to the square
mile; then Grant, in which Geelong and a portion of the Ballarat
goldfields are situated, with 40 persons to the square mile : then
Bendigo, having in it the town of Sandhurst and extensive gold
workings, with 23 persons to the square mile; then Dalhousie,
an important agricultural county, containing also the towns of
Kilmore, Kyneton, Heathcote, Woodend, Malmsbury, and some
goldfields, with 20 persons to the square mile; then Yilliers, a fine
agricultural county on the coast, possessing the seaports of Belfast
and Warnambool,and the towns of Koroit, Penshurst, and Yambuk,
with 13 persons to the square mile; then Gladstone, containing
the towns of Dunolly and Tarnagulla, and numerous goldfields,
with 9 persons to the square mile; then Bogong, containing the
towns of Beech worth, Bright, Wangaratta, and Chiltern, together
with goldfields, with over 8 persons to the square mile; then
Eipon, having a population, part mining and part agricultural
and pastoral, with not quite 8 persons to the square mile; then
N ormanby, a coast county, containing the seaport of Portland,
but having, for the most part, only poor or thickly-timbered land,
with 5 persons to the square mile; then Evelyn, Hampden,
* The portions of the colony heretofore called unsettled districts were pro-
claimed on the 20th February, 1871, as counties: —The names of all the counties
are Anglesey, Benambra (named after Benambra Mountains), Bogong (native
name for a peculiar large grub), Borung (name of broad-leaved mallee), Bourke,
Buln Buln, Croajingolong (named after a species of opossum found in Gipps Land),
Dalhousie, Dargo (named after the river), Delatite (named after the river),
Dundas, Evelyn, Follett, Grant, Grenville, Gunbower, Hampden, Heytesbury,
Kara Kara (native name for gold), Karkarooc, Lowan (the mallee hen),
Millewa (named after the native name of the Murray River), Moira, Morning-
ton, Normanby, Polwarth, Ripon, Rodney, Talbot, Tambo (after a native
chief), Tanjil (named after the river), Tatchera, Yilliers, Weeah (after narrow-
leaved mallee, a water-yielding kind), and Wonnangatta (named after the river).
In June, 1869, a county of Bendigo was proclaimed, and on the 14th March, 1870,
the boundaries of that county and of Talbot were altered. In January, 1870, the
county of Gladstone was proclaimed, and on the 20th February, 1871, the boundary
of Bendigo was again altered. At the present moment the whole of Victoria is
mapped out into defined counties as is seen by the map prefixed to this issue.


Mornington, Rodney, and Kara Kara, with each between 4 and 5
persons to the square mile; then Tanjil, Delatite, Heyteshury,
Polwarth, Anglesey, and Dundas, with each between 3 and 4
persons to the square mile ; then Borung, with between 2 and 3
persons to the square mile; then Buln Buln, Dargo, Follett,
Moira, and Wonnangatta, with each between 1 and 2 persons to
the square mile; then Benambra, Croajingolong, Gunbower,
Karkarooc, Lowan, Millewa, Tam bo, and Tatchera, each with less
than 1 person to the square mile. The county of Weeah,
situated in the old Wimmera District, close to the South Aus-
tralian frontier, is believed to be totally uninhabited, no person
having been found within its limits on the census night.
HOUSES.
53. The number of inhabited houses in Victoria was ascer-
tained in 18G1 to be 129,196, and in 1871 to be 150,618. The
average number of persons to a house was thus 4'2, or 42 persons
to 10 houses at the former period, and 4'9, or 49 persons to 10
houses at the latter.
54. In 1871, besides the inhabited houses just mentioned, there
were 6997 houses untenapted, and 866 in the course of erection.
The total number of edifices of all descriptions was 158,481.
The materials were thus returned : —Houses of brick or stone,
•33,461; houses of wood, iron, or lath and plaster, 101,635; tents
and dwellings with canvas roofs, 4656 ; huts made of bark, slabs,
or mud, 16,499; and buildings of materials not specified, 2230.
The classification as to number of rooms showed the following'
results:—ls,36s houses had more than 6 rooms, 21,928 had 5 or 6
rooms, 62,845 had 3 or 4 rooms, 33,223 had 2 rooms, and 20,738
had only 1 room.
55. The number of inhabited houses to the square mile when
the census was taken in 1861 was T 465, or nearly 3 houses to 2
miles. In 1871 the number to the square mile was T7OB, or about 5
houses to 3 miles. In England and Wales, according to the
O 7 ' o
census of 1861, there were on the average 64 dwellings to the
square mile, and 5'4 persons to a house. In New South Wales in
1861 there was but T7B of a house to the square mile, with over
6 persons to each house; while in South Australia in 1871 there
was T 23 of a house only to each square mile, with 493 persons to
each house.*
* These calculations have been made upon the following basis: —England and-
Wales, area 58,320 square miles; population, 1861, 20,066,224; houses, 3,739,505;
houses to the square mile, 64-12; persons to a house, 5-366. New South Wales,
area 323,437 square miles; population, 1861, 350,860; houses, 57,412; houses to the
square mile, -178; persons to a house, 6TII. South Australia, area 312,500 square
miles; population, 1871, 188,995; houses, 38,333; houses to the square mile, -123;
persons to a house, 4-93.


56. The metropolis of Victoria is Melbourne, the most important
city in the Southern hemisphere. In 1861, Melbourne and its
suburbs within a radius of ten miles contained 139,916 inhabi-
tants, and these had increased on the 2nd April, 1871, to 206,780
The city proper at the latter date contained 54,993 persons, or
within twenty thousand of the population of the City of
London. The second most populous town in Victoria in 1871 was
Ballarat, consisting, with its suburbs, of three municipalities, and
having in all 47,201 inhabitants. Sandhurst came third on the
list, consisting of two municipalities, and having 28,577 inhabi-
tants ; then Geelong, consisting of three municipalities, and hav-
ing 21,459 inhabitants; and then followed Castlemaine, Chines,
Stawell, and Daylesford, with 6935, 6068, 5166, and 4696 in-
habitants, respectively.

58. A list of towns and townships throughout the colony, together
with the position of each, the pursuits with which each is con-
nected, the number of houses in each, and the population accord-
ing to the census of 1871, will be found in Appendix D, post.
ABORIGINES.
59. When Port Phillip was first settled, it is believed that the
aborigines numbered about 5000. According to official returns
made in the year of separation from New South Wales (1851),
this number had become reduced to 2693. An attempt was made
to take an account of their numbers at the censuses of 1857, 1861,
and 1871. The result was 1768 at the first, 1694 at the second,
and 1330—viz., 784 males and 546 females—at the third period.
It is not pretended, however, that all were enumerated on any of
those occasions. The returns from the Central Board for the Pro-
tection of the Aborigines testified to the ascertained existence of
1860 in different parts of the colony in August, 1861, and of 1638
in August, 1872. It is satisfactory to learn that, though their
numbers decreased rapidly in the early years of the colony, they
are not now diminishing to any serious extent. This improve-
ment is no doubt owing, in a great measure, to the efforts of the
Central Board, who receive and expend an annual sum voted by
Parliament expressly for the aborigines. Those who are in want
can always obtain food and clothing at fixed stations, and the sick
are in like manner provided with medical attendance and medical
comforts. According to the last annual report of the Board, the
amount voted and available for expenditure, for expenses con-
nected with the aborigines during the year 1871 and the first
six months of 1872, was £12,603 15s. 3d., and the sum expended
during the year 1871 was £5025 9s. Id., leaving a balance of
£7568 6s. 2d. to the credit of the Board.
60, The following stores were distributed amongst the aborigines
during the year 1871: —
Also, boots, hats, hose, flannel, calico, print, needles and thread,
canvas, salt, mustard, hops, medicines, medical comforts, cooking
utensils, knives, axes, farming implements, and a quantity of mis-
cellaneous articles.
AGES OF THE POPULATION,
61. The average age of the people of both sexes in Victoria,
when the census was taken, was about 23 years and 5 months;

that of males was about 25 years and 3 months, and that of females
21 years and nearly 4 months. The average age of males therefore
exceeded that of females by 4 years. In England the mean age
of males is 26 years, and therefore differs from that of males in
Victoria by nine months ; but the average age of females in Eng-
land is ten months in excess of that of males, instead of being
about four years less, as in Victoria. The following table gives the
census return of the ages of the people of Victoria, an estimate
being made for those whose ages were not stated in the schedule:—
Table XlV. —Ages, 1871.


AGES IN VICTORIA AND NEW SOUTH WALES COMPARED,
01. A remarkable resemblance exists between the popula-
tions of Victoria and New South Wales, so far as their physical
strength is concerned. In Victoria, the persons under 15 and
over 65, in 10,000 at all ages, amounted, at the period of the last
census, to 4371, and in New South Wales they amounted to
4893; whilst the persons between 15 and 65, who may be
supposed to be the supporting class of the community, numbered
5629 in 10,000 in the case of Victoria, and 5607 in 10,000 in the
case of New South Wales, thus

AGES IN ENGLAND AND VICTORIA COMPARED.
63. It has been assumed in the mother country that the popu-
lation under 10 years of age and over 70 are sustained by the
exertions of those between 20 and 60, whilst persons between the
ages of 10 and 20 and between 60 and 70, as a rule, support
themselves, but are not able to contribute to the sustenance of
others. By a calculation based upon this supposition, it was
found that in England and Wales, when the census of 1861
was taken, the persons at the supporting period of life were
charged with the sustenance of a class amounting to 59 per cent,
of their own numbers. When the census of Victoria was taken
in 1854, the aged and the young amounted to only 32 per cent, of
those at the middle period of life. In 1857 the former had
increased to 38 per cent, of the latter, in 1861 to 50 per cent., and
in 1871 to no less than 66 per cent., thus showing that the
sustaining class in this colony is now weighted with a proportion-
ally larger number of dependents than the same class in England.
64. If the persons under 20 and over 60 are considered as the
dependent classes, but little difference is found to exist between
England and Wales and Victoria, as will be seen by the following
figures: —

that the males between 20 and 40, or at what is technically termed
the soldier’s age, are as 291 in every 1000 of all ages in the
former, to 310 in every 1000 of the latter; and that females,
from infancy to 40 years of age, or at and below the fruitful child-
bearing period, are as 748 in England and Wales to 848 in Victoria.

67. Taking all the Protestant sects, the number of persons
claiming to be Protestants numbered 517,541, or about seven-
tenths of the population. The Roman Catholics amounted to
over 23 per cent, of the inhabitants. There was about 1 Jew to
every 205 persons living, and the residue, embracing all other sects,
those of no religion, and those whose religions were not specified,
amounted to rather less than an eighteenth of the population.

The number of Chinese professing Christianity was 285, out
ol a total of 17,935, or about 1 in 63. The Aborigines who
professed to be Christians numbered 311 out of 1330, or some-
thing less than a fourth.
IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION.
68. From the first settlement of the colony to the end of 1871,
1,019,553 persons are recorded as having arrived, and 563,277
persons as having left the country. This leaves an excess of
arrivals over departures equal to 456,276 souls. The following
return shows the number of persons of both sexes who arrived
and departed by sea during 36 years. The largest immigration
took place in 1852, and the largest emigration in 1853. The
total departures exceeded the total arrivals in 1861 and 1862.
The departures of males exceeded the arrivals of males not only in
those two years, but also in 1863. The arrivals of females were in
each year uniformly in excess of the departures of females.

69. Among the varied inducements held out to the inhabitants
of the United Kingdom for emigration to Victoria, has been the
practice of granting aid to certain classes of immigrants, by
defraying either wholly or in part their cost of transit from
Europe to Australia. The total number of immigrants assisted
from 1838 to the end of 1871 was 166,401, of whom 67,578 were
males, and 98,823 were females; the female immigrants have
been greatly in excess, since the reduction of the disproportion
existing among the sexes was one of the objects proposed by the
Government in dispensing its bounty.
70. The following table furnishes the number of assisted immi-
grants of both sexes from the year 1838, the experience of the
last sixteen years set forth year by year :

71. The sum of £2,002,465 Bs. 3d. has been expended by the
colony upon the introduction of immigrants, from the year of its
separation from New South Wales, 1851, to the end of 1871.
The number introduced during the period, according to the last
table, was 166,401. The cost per head was therefore £l2 os. B|d.

75. According to recent European
returns the birth, marriage,.
It will be observed tliat 80 per cent, of the males and 95 per
cent, of the females under 20 years of age are in the domestic
class, which includes scholars at public and private schools, and
those returned merely as “son,” “ daughter,” “visitor,” &c., but
without any occupation being specified.
BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, AND DEATHS.
72. During the decennial period, 1862-1871, the total number
of births registered in Victoria was 258,326, and that of deaths
103,984. The gain to the population by natural increase has
therefore been 154,342 in the last ten years. In the year 1871
the births numbered 27,382, and the deaths 9918. The excess of
the former over the latter in that year was therefore 17,464.
73. The number of marriages in 1871 was 4693. Of these 3735
were between bachelors and spinsters; 371 between bachelors
and widows; 353 between widowers and spinsters; and 234
between widowers and widows. Of the men 96, and of the
women 1254, had not attained the full age of 21.
74. The number of births, deaths, and marriages in every thou-
sand of the living population during each of the last ten years,
and the mean of the whole decennial period, were as follow :
Table XXll. —Proportion of Births, Marriages, and Deaths.
* The numbers in this column, doubled, give the number of persons married in
proportion to every thousand of the living population.


and death rates in four of the principal European countries are as.

76. It thus appears that the birth and death rates in Victoria
are more favourable, the one being much higher and the other-
considerably lower than in any of the countries named; but that
the mean marriage rate is lower in Victoria than in any of those
countries. These comparisons result from tables of births, mar-
riages, and deaths of the various countries, in connection with
their respective populations. The absolute value of such compari-
sons, however, depends upon the similarity of the proportions of
persons at any age to the total population in each country.
COMPARATIVE MORTALITY PER CENT. AT EACH CENSUS FROM
1841 TO 1871.
77. The total recorded mortality in 1841 was 319 out of 15,353
persons living during that year in the Port Phillip district, and
the mortality was therefore at the rate of a little over 2 per cent.
At this period upwards of 70 per cent, of the population consisted
of adults.
78. In 1846 there were recorded 328 deaths out of 34,807
living, which was less than one per cent, of mortality, notwith-
standing the percentage of adult population from 21 to 60 had
decreased to less than 60 per cent., and the proportion of children
under 5 had increased from 13 per cent, of the total population in
1841, to upwards of 25 per cent, in 1846. Either this was a year
of remarkable healthiness, or some defect existed in the machinery
of registration.*
*The present system of registration was introduced in the year 1853.


79. In 1851 the number of deaths recorded was 1165 out of
80,825 living during the year, or 1342 per cent., a marked
increase on the mortality recorded as having obtained in 1846.
80. But it was in 1854 that the highest rate of mortality is
observable, and the immense influx of adults attracted by the
richness of our goldfields, brought the proportion of people living
between 21 and 60 to 62 per cent, of the population, the children
under 5 years forming only about 11| per cent, of the total living.
Notwithstanding this, however, the mortality recorded in that
year was 2342 per cent. This was doubtless consequent upon
the hardships endured by the miners, combined with the habits of
dissipation too common among all classes at that period of
universal gold-getting.
81. In 1857 the deaths recorded were 7449 out of 430,347
living, or 173 per cent.
82. In 1861 there were 10,522 deaths out of 541,025 living, or
not quite 2 per cent.; the proportion of children under 5 at that
time being 18 per cent, of the total population, and the proportion
of adults between 15 and 60 being 64 per cent.
83. In the year of the last census, 1871, the mortality was
remarkably small. The population numbered 738,725, but the
deaths amounted only to 9918, or to 134 per cent, of the popula-
lation. The children under 5, as returned at the census, were equal
to 16 per cent, of the total population, and the proportion
of persons between 15 and 60 was 54 per cent.
MORTALITY IN THE SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE YEAR,
84. Among males at all ages, from observations made over the
last ten years, the months of greatest mortality were in the fol-
lowing order, .commencing at the highest as to number of
deaths: —l January, 2 March, 3 April, 4 February, 5 Decem-
ber, 6 May. Among females, at all ages, over the same period,
the months of greatest mortality were ; —1 March, 2 January, 3
April, 4 February, 5 May, 6 December.
85. Among males, at all ages, over the same period, the months
of least mortality, were, commencing with the highest as to healthi-
ness : —1 November, 2 September, 3 October, 4 August, 5 July, 6
June. Among females, at all ages, the months of least mortality
were : —1 September, 2 November, 3 October, 4 August, 5 July, 6
June.
86. With respect to infants under one year, the months of
highest mortality are found to be, among males : —1 January, 2
March, 3 February, 4 April, 5 December, 6 May; and among
females, 1 January, 2 February, 3 March, 4 April, 5 December, 6
May. The months of least mortality among both male and


female infants are: —1 September, 2 October, 3 August, 4 June,
5 November, 6 July.
87. In regard to adults from the age of 20 to 45, over the same
number of years, the months of highest mortality were, for males :
—1 March, 2 January, 3 May, 4 June, 5 October, 6 December ;
and for females, 1 March, 2 May, 3 January, 4 July, 5 June, 6
April. The months of least mortality for males were : —1 Feb-
ruary, 2 November, 3 August, 4 April, 5 September, G July; and
for females, 1 November, 2 February, 3 September, 4 August, 5
December, G October.
88. These results, of course, vary somewhat in different years ;
but taken in connection with the chronological tables, there is
sufficient indication of peculiar general laws, both of sickness and
mortality, affecting different ages at different seasons of the year.
These laws will, sooner or later, doubtless obtain a full investiga-
tion and illustration at the hands of the medical profession.
89. The number of deaths in Victoria occurring in each month,
out of every thousand deaths during the year, are given in the
following table, which shows an average extending over the ten

The declension in the rate of mortality in Victoria, both for
males and females, from birth to the age of 65, in 1871, as compared
with 1861, is most remarkable, and indicates the danger of relying
on the experience of any one year as a permanent guide. It is
certain, however, that the value of human life in Victoria has
six months from June to November inclusive is below the
monthly average, and that in the remaining six months is above
that average.
AGES AT DEATH IN VICTORIA, ENGLAND, AND FRANCE COMPARED.

93. The proportion of deaths from diseases of the zymotic type
is greater in Victoria than in England, as also is that from develop-
mental diseases and from violence. But the proportion from con-
stitutional diseases, of which phthisis or consumption is the most
fatal, and also from local diseases, which include those which have
their seat in particular organs, is greater in England than in
Victoria.
94. The number of deaths of persons of all ages from the
different classes of diseases to every thousand deaths from all
causes, during each of the last sixteen years, will be found in

95. The following are amongst the results which are deducible
from this table: —
9(5. The number of deaths from zymotic diseases in 1000 deaths
from all causes, averaged 305 in the sixteen years ending the 31st
December, 1871. The highest proportion in any one of the years
was in 1860, when deaths from this class of affections amounted to
38(5 in 1000. The lowest proportion was in 1870, when they only
amounted to 236 in 1000. They were above the average of the
period in the four years 1859-1862, and in the four years 1865-
1868, and they were below it in the other eight years.
97. Constitutional diseases caused upon the average 131 deaths
in 1000 during the sixteen years. The highest proportion to the
1000 was 143 in 1870, and the lowest 115 in 1860. Deaths
under this head were below the average in the five years 1859-
1863, in 1866 and in 1867, and above it in the nine remaining
years.
98. The proportion of deaths from local diseases is on the
average 320 in 1000 from all causes. This number was exceeded
in the eight and ninth and the last four years of the period, and
was not reached in any of the ten others. The highest proportion
was 371 in 1000, and occurred in 1870 and 1871; the lowest was
281 in 1000, and took place in 1860.
99. Deaths from developmental diseases were in the whole
period of sixteen years in the proportion of 152 in 1000, which
average was exceeded in the three years 1856-1858, the two years
1862-1863, the year 1865, and the two years 1870-1871, and not
equalled in the other eight years. The highest proportion of
deaths to the thousand from this class was 170 in 1858, and the
lowest was 130 in 1861.
100. Violent deaths were about in the proportion of 93 to the
thousand from all causes, in the sixteen years, the highest average
being 131 in 1856, and the lowest 71 in 1866. The mean of the
sixteen years was exceeded in 1856, 1857, 1858, 1859, 1862, 1863,
and 1864, and not reached in the remaining nine years.
101. The next table gives the number of deaths of persons of
all ages, from all causes, and from each class of causes, to every
1000 of the average population of the colony during each of the
last sixteen years.

inclusive, and in the two years 1866 and 1867, and was not

103. It is also observable that the average mortality from
zymotic diseases, as gathered from the results of sixteen years, is
5’28 to the 1000 persons living ; that the average from consti-
tutional diseases is 221 to the 1000; that the average from
local diseases is 5*40 to the 1-000; that the average from develop-
mental diseases is 2 - 58 to the 1000; and that the average from
violence is 1*57 to the 1000.
104. It is further evident that the year which relatively to the
population was that of the greatest total mortality, 1860, was also

that of the highest mortality from zymotic diseases (8'56 to the
1000), from constitutional diseases (2 55 to the 1000), from local
diseases (6’22 to the 1000), and from developmental diseases
(317 to the 1000), and that the year in which the relative num-
ber of violent deaths was greatest was 1857 (2 - 09 to the 1000).
105. In like manner, the years in which the rate of mortality
was lowest from each class of causes, and the years in which it
was greater or less than the mean rate, for the sixteen years,
may be ascertained from the table.
106. The following table shows the number of persons, at
various periods of life, who died from all causes and each class of
causes in 1000 deaths of persons at all ages, the results being the
average of ten years.

107. It is thus seen that, in every 1000 deaths from zymotic
diseases, 337, or about a third, are of children under 1 year,
which is rather higher than the proportion that the deaths of
children under 1 year bear to the deaths from all causes (328 in
1000), and is within a trifle of the proportion that deaths from
zymotic diseases in the next four years of life, viz., from 1 to 5,
bear to the total deaths from zymotic diseases (340 in 1000).
108. It is also seen that deaths from all causes at the last four
periods of life, embracing ages from five years upwards, bear a
higher proportion to the deaths at all ages than do the deaths from
zymotic diseases; but at the first two periods, comprising ages
under five years, the proportion dying from zymotic diseases to
the total deaths from zymotic diseases is greater than the propor-
tion dying from all causes to the total deaths from all causes.
109. Similar comparisons may be made with respect to the
•other causes of death. Looking at deaths from developmental
diseases, it will be observed that 682 in 1000, or more than two-


thirds, occur to infants under one year of age, whilst only 328 in
1000, or less than one-third of the deaths from all causes, are of
children at that age. Also that of deaths from violence, 530 in
1000, or more than half, occur to persons between the ages of 15
and 45, whereas only 284 in 1000 of the deaths from all causes are
of persons at those ages.
110. Of zymotic diseases, which include all those of an epidemic,
endemic, contagious, or infectious character, the most fatal are
diarrhoea and dysentery, which prevail chiefly during the summer
months. In eighteen years these caused on an average 123 deaths
in 1000, or about an eighth part of the total mortality. The years
of greatest mortality from them were 1858, in which they caused
163 deaths in 1000; 1859, in which they caused 155 in 1000; and
1860, in which they caused 148 inIOOO. The years of least mortality
from the same complaints were 1868, in which they caused no
more than 86; 1864, in which they caused only 87; 1870, in which
they caused only 91; and 1863, in which they caused only 92
deaths in 1000. Scarlatina, measles, and diphtheria have also
been very fatal in some years, especially among children. The
first two complaints prevailed in 1853, during the last six months
of which year they caused 95 deaths in every 1000 from all
causes. In the following year the mortality from them fell to 43
in 1000, and from that time they were but little felt until 1860,
when they broke out in an epidemic form, and together caused 59
deaths in 1000. In 1861 the mortality from them rose to 107 in
1000, in 1862 it fell to 44 in 1000, in 1863 to 34 in 1000, in 1864
to 32 in 1000, and in 1865 to 22 in 1000. In 1866 it again in-
creased to 73, and in 1867 to 107 in 1000 ; in 1868 it fell to 48,
in 1869 to 23, and in 1870 and 1871 to 3 deaths per 1000. Diph-
theria was apparently unknown until 1858, in which year six
deaths from its effects were recorded, being less than 1 in 1000
In 1859 deaths from diphtheria increased to 30 in 1000 from all
causes, and in 1860 to 53 in 1000, which was the maximum. In
1861 the mortality from diphtheria was 49 in 1000, in 1862 it was
36, and in 1868, 35 in 1000. In 1864 it rose to 51 in 1000 ; in
1865 it again fell to 38, and in 1866 to 27 in 1000. In 1867 it
rose to 29, in 1868 to 45, and in 1869 to 47 per 1000; in 1870 it
sank to 40, and in 1871 to 26 in 1000. Small-pox has never
spread in the colony. A few cases have from time to time been
brought by ships, but have quickly died out by isolation. The
same may be said of typhus. Typhoid fevers, however, are by
no means rare, a type of which, locally called “ colonial fever,” is
frequently fatal. Agues are uncommon, as are also remittent
fevers. No case of Asiatic cholera has ever occurred in any part
of Australia. Hydrophobia is also unknown.
111. Constitutional diseases are divided into diathetic and tuber-


cular. The former includes gout, dropsy, cancer, &c., and the latter
scrofula, tabes mesenterica, phthisis, hydrocephalus, &c.
112. Cancer in a fatal form has been increasing of late years.
In the last six months of 1858 it only caused 1 death, and in
1854 only 3 deaths in every 1000 from all causes ; whereas in
1862 it caused 8 deaths in 1000, in 1863 11 in 1000, in 1864 and
1865 14 deaths in 1000, and in the last six years it has caused on
the average 16 deaths in 1000. On the other hand, dropsy is not
so fatal now as formerly. In 1853 it caused 20 deaths, and in
1854 13 deaths in 1000 from all causes; in 1864 it caused only 8,
and in 1865 only 7 deaths in 1000. Gout as a fatal disease is un-
common. In 1871 it caused L 42 deaths in 1000, but this propor-
tion is much above the average. During several years no death
from gout was recorded.
113. Phthisis is by far the most fatal disease of the tubercular
type of constitutional diseases, and next to it hydrocephalus.
Relatively to the whole mortality, the last six years show an in-
crease in the number of deaths from phthisis, as will be seen by
the following figures: —1866, 64 deaths in 1000; 1867, 68 ; 1868,
75; 1869, 84; 1870, 86; 1871, 85 in 1000. The mortality in 18
years from phthisis was in the proportion,of 73 deaths in 1000, and
from hydrocephalus in the proportion of 18 deaths per 1000 from
all causes.
114. Local diseases include all those of particular organs, and
are divided as follows : —l. Diseases of the nervous system, which
in 18 years caused upon the average 107 deaths in every 1000
from all causes. 2. Diseases of the organs of circulation, which
caused upon the average 41 deaths in 1000. 3. Diseases of the
respiratory system, which caused 86 deaths in 1000. 4. Diseases
of the digestive organs, which caused 67 deaths in 1000. 5,
Diseases of the urinary organs, which caused 8 deaths in 1000.
6. Diseases of the organs of generation, which caused a fraction
less than 2 deaths in 1000. 7. Diseases of the locomotive
system, which caused a fraction more than 2 deaths in 1000. 8.
Diseases of the integumentary system, which caused nearly 2
deaths in 1000.
115. Developmental diseases, or those of growth, nutrition, or
decay, are divided into those of children, those of adults, those of
old people, and diseases of nutrition.
116. Developmental diseases of children are premature birth,
malformations, and teething. In eighteen years 33 deaths in every
1000 resulted from the last-named cause. Developmental diseases
of adults refer chiefly to those incidental to child-bearing. In
eighteen years, the number of women who died from childbirth,
including metria, was in the proportion of one to every 221
children born alive. The deaths classed under developmental

diseases of old people refer only to those caused by old age. The
most fatal diseases of nutrition are atrophy and debility, from
which, on an average, 78 deaths were caused in every 1000 which
occurred during eighteen years.
117. Violent deaths are not so numerous now as in the days
immediately succeeding the gold discoveries. In 1856,130 deaths,
and in 1857 122 deaths in every 1000 resulted from external in-
juries. In 1864 the proportion was 95 ;in 1865, 87; in 1866, 71;
in 1867, 72; in 1868, 92; in 1869,81; in 1870, 86 and in 1871, 89,
in every 1000. The persons who committed suicide in fifteen
years numbered 1029, of whom 858 were males and 171 were
females. The criminals executed during 24 years numbered 115,
of whom only one was a female.
CHINESE MORTALITY.
118. During nine years, 2183 Chinese deaths were observed.
Their ages ranged from 20 to 45 years. In the same period
9873 European males died at the same ages. The following are
the principal causes of death amongst the Chinese, arranged
in order of fatality, and placed side by side with the deaths of
European males between 20 and 60 years of age :
Table XXX— Deaths of Chinese and Europeans Compared.
1862-1871.
119. It will be observed that the causes specified above,
occasioned 64 per cent, of the deaths of the Chinese, and 54 per cent,
of those of the other colonists at the same ages. It will also be seen

that, in relation to the total mortality of either class, typhoid
fever, dysentery, dropsy, and accidents were more fatal, and
suicides were more frequent among the Chinese than amongst the
Europeans; that phthisis was more fatal amongst the Europeans ;
and that heart disease and pneumonia were equally fatal amongst
both. Within the last few years much less divergence than for-
merly has taken place in the main causes of death amongst the
Chinese, as compared with those of Europeans.
INFANT MORTALITY.
120. One of the severest tests of viability or vital force, in any
community, in connecton with climate, race, and habits, is the rate
per cent, per annum of mortality among infants, deduced by compar-
ing the deaths under one year with the births. In this manner the
following table was calculated.
121. It will be observed that the
cent, in 1864 to 153 per cent, in 1866
over the ten years, 1862-1871, among
one year, was 32,597, or 126 per cei
lower than that obtaining in England, v
years (1851-1860) the ratio of infantile cl
and in the year 1870 it was 16 per
rate varied from 10 - 8 per
•6; and that the mortality
ig 258,326 children under
cent. This result is much
~ where over a period of ten
le deaths was 18'26 per cent.;
cent, in that country. But
although the rate of mortality of infants is remarkably low in Vic-
toria as compared with that of the healthiest countries in Europe,
yet there is no doubt it will still further decline in proportion to
the progress of morals and hygienic knowledge among the people.

123. The total number of cases of infirmity returned amount
to 13,307. This, in a population of 731,528, gives a proportion of
1 person in every 55 rendered non-effective, either wholly or
partially, by one of the causes adduced. The disabled males were
in the proportion of 1 to every 49 of the male population, the
disabled females in that of 1 to every G 4 of the female population
of the colony.
124. The sick were in the ratio of 1 to every 85 of the popula-
tion, those suffering from accidents in that of 1 to every 575.
The sick and the maimed together amounted to 9959, a number
which furnishes a proportion relatively to the whole population
of 1 to 73. The lunatics returned furnish a proportion of 1
lunatic to every 392 inhabitants of the colony, 1 lunatic male to
every 358 males, 1 lunatic female to every 442 females. The
idiots were in the proportion of 1 to every 6773 of the popula-
tion, 1 idiot male to every 6915 males, 1 idiot female to every
6610 females. The deaf and dumb returned give 1 deaf mute to
every 3621 persons of both sexes, 1 deaf and dumb male to every
3314 males, 1 deaf and dumb female to every 4080 females. The
blind returned were in the proportion of 1 to every 1457 of both
sexes, 1 blind male to every 1102 males, 1 blind female to every
2395 females.* The deaf only were in the proportion of Ito
* In some parts of Switzerland there is said to be 1 deaf mute in every 206 of
the population. In England and Wales, in 1851, the proportion was lin 1738.
The statistics relating to blindness show a range varying from 1 blind person in
482 of the inhabitants of Norway to I in 979 of those in England and Wales.

MILITARY.
125. Prior to the year 1870 it was the practice to keep a small
detachment of imperial troops in Victoria, but, in September
and October of that year, these were permanently withdrawn, and
a corps of local artillery was organised by the Victorian Govern-
ment in their stead.
126. The authorised establishment of this local Defence Corps
is 138 of all ranks. On the 31st December, 1871, however, the
— -- ; • ~; “ • —;
strength was only 119, or 19 short of the establishment. The
numbers of the different ranks, at that date, were as follow :

127. The men from the Defence Corps are drafted off to the
ranks of the police and of the warders of gaols and penal establish-
ments, as vacancies occur in these services.
128. The military expenditure is now all defrayed by the
colony. The total amount expended on defences and land forces
during the year 1871 was £29,507 6s. 3d.
VOLUNTEERS.
129. The volunteer force of Victoria is a fine body of men, and
its members have shown much zeal in rendering themselves effec-
tive. The total establishment authorised is 3807, consisting of six
troops of cavalry, each numbering 42; ten corps of artillery, nine
of them numbering 150, and one numbering 75; one corps of
engineers, numbering 150; one torpedo and signal corps, num-
bering 30 ; and thirteen corps of rifles, each numbering 150.

rank and file, and 74 in bands not included in the strength of
corps, making a grand total of 3940, or 133 in excess of the
establishment.
132. The following was the strength of the respective branches
of the service at the end of 1871 ;
133. The volunteers are armed with the following rifles, the
property of the Government: —
NATURALISATION.
134. Aliens residing in Victoria may obtain letters of naturali-
sation upon taking an oath of allegiance to the Crown before any
judge or police magistrate, as prescribed by an Act of the Legis-
lature (26 Viet., No. 166).
135. But without becoming naturalised, alien friends resident
in the colony may acquire real and personal property, and may
hold, convey, devise, and bequeath it in the same manner as if
they had been natural-born subjects of Her Majesty.
136. Alien women being married to British subjects thereby
become naturalised.
137. The following table shows the number of persons of
different countries who have procured letters of naturalisation

PRODUCTION.
CROWN LAND SALES.
138. During the year 1871, 378,516 acres of Crown land were
sold, and 118 acres were granted, making a total of 378,634 acres
sold and granted. The amount realised upon land sales was
£528,119, or an average of £1 7s. lid. per acre.
139. The extent of Crown land granted and sold, the gross
amount realised, and the average price per acre during each of the
last ten years, were as follow:—It will be observed that the
greatest quantity of land was alienated, and the largest amount of
money obtained, in 1862, that the average price per acre was
highest in 1865, and that less land was alienated in 1867 than in
any of the other years.

same period would be 48,329,035 a. Or. 22p.
141. The total amount realised upon the alienation of Crown
land, from the first Port Phillip land sales to the end of 1865, has
been £14,726,482, and the average price per acre, over the whole
period, has been .€1 16s. 3|d.
LEASES FOR OTHER THAN PASTORAL PURPOSES.
142. Besides the alienation of land by absolute sale, provision
was made in the Land Act of 1862 (25 Victoria, No. 145), in the
Amending Land Act of 1865 (28 Victoria, No. 237), and in the
Land Act of 1869 (33 Victoria, No. 360), for leasing Crown lands
for agricultural purposes to selectors, with a view to their ultimate
purchase in fee by the lessee. Under the present system an
individual may, under certain conditions of residence and im-
provement, select up to 320 acres. For this he pays two shillings
per acre per annum, and acquires the fee simple after having
made ten payments, or £1 per acre in all.

licenses for pastoral purposes. These licenses are renewed
annually.
144. The rent paid by the pastoral licensees, or squatters, as
they are termed, for the occupation of their runs, is in accordance
with the grazing capabilities of the land contained therein, upon
the following scale : —Two shillings yearly for each head of cattle
or horses the run can depasture, and eightpence for each sheep.
145. The number of squatters at the end of 1871 was 974, who
held in the aggregate 27,972,523 acres. This was in the propor-
tion of 28,719 acres to each squatter. The following table shows
the number of squatting runs, and the extent of land contained
therein, for a series of years :

AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS.
146. The agricultural statistics of Victoria are collected yearly.
The work is clone by the Shire and Borough Councils, except in a
few places not yet included within the limits of the jurisdiction of
those bodies, for which paid collectors are appointed. The whole
is under the supervision of the Registrar-General, and the com-
pilation of the returns is effected in his office.
147. Printed instructions, in regard to the collection of the re-
turns, are issued yearly to the Shire and Borough Councils by the
Registrar-General. According to these instructions the collectors
are required to call upon every occupier of land, provided his
holding is of a larger extent than one acre. At each holding they
are enjoined to make inquiries as to the nature of the tenure
under which the land is held; the number of acres occupied and
fenced; the number cultivated, with each crop; the produce of
each crop; the number of hands employed; the quantity of live
stock of each kind kept; and the number, description, and value
of agricultural implements and machines used. These particulars
are inserted by them in the schedule (Appendix E), to which the


signature of the pccupier is then obtained, as a guarantee —first,
that a personal visit has really been paid to the holding; and
secondly, that the information is authentic.
148. When the returns are collected the schedules are forwarded
to the Registrar-General’s Office, where the contents of each
schedule are carefully copied into large sheets provided for the pur-
pose. These sheets contain columns corresponding with the blank
spaces for entries in the schedules. When the copying is
completed the columns are added, and summaries are thus made
of the different shires, boroughs, and counties, and afterwards a
general summary of the entire colony.
149. As soon as possible a series of tables is published in the
Government Gazette for general information. Afterwards more
extended tables are compiled, showing percentages of increase or
decrease, averages of produce, classification of holdings, as to size
and tenure, comparisons with former years, and many other details.
Summaries of live stock, and tables showing the number of hands
employed; the average duration of leases and rental paid; the
average price of agricultural produce; the average weight of
crops; the rates of labour on farms and stations; the quantity and
value of agricultural machines and implements in use are also
given; and these, with the original summary tables, are embodied
in the general statistics of the year under the head “Production,”
and presented to Parliament.
150. In addition to the returns mentioned, the collectors are
supplied with the forms requisite to procure statistics respecting
the mills for grinding and dressing grain, the various branches of
manufacturing industry, and of the number of private schools and
scholars throughout their districts. A great deal of useful infor-
mation is thus obtained, which could only be got by the employ-
ment of regular collectors.
151. The agricultural year ends on the 31st March, by which
time the previous season’s crops are stored.
152. The number of occupiers of lots above one acre in extent,
on the 31st March, 1872, was 33,720. The aVea in their occupa-
tion was 10,100,679 acres. This acreage gives an average of 300
acres to each holder, or about 13| acres to every man, woman,
and child in the colony. The area enclosed at the same period
was 9,382,778 acres, or 93 per cent, of the land in occupation.
The total extent cultivated was 937,220 acres, or about 9
per cent, of the occupied land. The average cultivated by each
occupier was nearly 28 acres. The ratio of cultivated land to the
population was 100 acres to every 78 persons.
153. The number of holdings, the extent of land in occupation,
the extent enclosed, and that cultivated during each of the last
ten years, have been as follows:

154. The principal crops during the past ten years have been
wheat, oats,
barley, potatoes, hay, and green forage for cattle.
The greatest
extent of land was placed under wheat in the past
season (year
ending 31st March, 1872), when nearly 335,000
acres were devoted to that crop, nearly equal to 36 per cent, of
wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, hay, and green forage for cattle.
The greatest extent of land was placed under wheat in the past
season (year ending 31st March, 1872), when nearly 335,000
acres were devoted to that crop, nearly equal to 36 per cent, of
the land in cultivation. The greatest extent under oats —nearly
176,000 acres —was also in 1872; the greatest extent under
barley—over 28,000 acres—was in 1870; the greatest extent
under potatoes —about 41,000 acres —was also in 1870; the
greatest extent under hay—about 163,000 acres —was in 1871;
the greatest extent under green forage—about 154,000 acres—
was also in 1871.

covered about 36 per cent, of the whole land in cultivation, oats
covered about 19 per cent., barley nearly 2 per cent, potatoes
about 4 per cent, hay about 11 per cent, and green forage 16
per cent. The produce of the first five of these crops during the
same ten years was as follows (no account is kept by the farmers

157. The average produce to the acre of these crops during the
past season, and for the whole period of ten years, has been as
follows;—
During Year During Ten Years
1871-1872. 1863-1872.
158. The highest acreable produce of wheat during the ten
years was in 1867, when a fraction over 22 bushels was reached;
the lowest was in 1864, a year in which the wheat crop was
visited by a disease called “ rust,” which reduced the average to 9
bushels. These rates, although they appear low as contrasted
with those of England and Wales, are yet higher than anything
that is usually produced in the adjacent colonies of South Aus-
tralia and New South Wales. In the former colony, during seven
years, 12f bushels to the acre was the average wheat crop, and
14 bushels was the highest average reached in any one year of
the period, and that only upon one occasion. In New South
Wales, the average for a period embracing six years was 11|


bushels, and the highest average of any year of the period was
barely 14 bushels.
159. Besides these crops, a certain amount of attention has each
year been paid to the cultivation of others of minor importance,
such as maize, rye, peas and beans, mangolds, vegetables, &c., for
all of which the soil and climate of Victoria are well adapted.
The following is the result of that cultivation during the past ten
years: —

acre; rye and here, 13 bushels ; peas, beans, &c., 20 bushels ; tur-
nips, 8| tons; mangel wurzel, 14 tons; beet, carrots, parsnips, and
eabbage, nearly 5 tons; and onions, 9 cwt.
161. For some time past considerable attention has been paid to
the growth of tobacco, and in aveiage seasons it has proved a re-
munerative crop. During the past year 299 acres were placed


164. The quantity of live stock in the colony of Victoria
during the past ten years will be found in the following table.
A slight falling off in the number of sheep will be observed in
the present year, but all other descriptions of stock are more
numerous now than at any former period:—

165. According to the latest returns, nearly 90 per cent, of the
horses, nearly 80 per cent, oh the cattle, and 97 per cent, of the
pigs, were the property of farmers, but
only about 38 per cent, of
under this crop, from which 2307 cwt. of tobacco was obtained,
being an average of 8 cwt. to the acre.
162. The cultivation of the vine is steadily increasing. In 1863
only 2007 acres were devoted to this crop. During the past sea-
son, no less than 5523 acres of vineyards were returned. From
these, 137,687 cwt. of grapes were gathered, of which 106,791
cwt. were made into wine and brandy, and 30,8.96 cwt. were other-
wise disposed of. The wine produced amounted to 713,589
gallons, and the brandy to 1579 gallons. It maybe observed that
Victorian wine is rapidly grpwing in favour with the public, and
that the wise legislation embodied in the Wines, Beer, and Spirits
Sale Statute of 1864 (27 Vic., No. 227) has afforded facilities for
its disposal which have been the means of largely adding to its
consumption.
163. Besides the vineyards, 9828 acres were in 1871-2 cultivated
as gardens, and 5805 acres as orchards; 964 acres were placed
under other crops —including artichokes, buckwheat, chicory, fax,
hops, kohlrabi, melons, opium poppies, peppermint, prairie grass
and rye grass for seed, rape, sugar beet, strawberries, vetches,
American broom millet, mulberries, olives, sunflowers, &c.; 79,584
.acres were permitted to lie fallow during the year.
LIVE STOCK.


the sheep belonged to farmers. The balance of the stock was the
property of the pastoral licensees, or squatters, and was kept
upon the Crown land embraced in their runs and the purchased
land attached thereto.
166. It lias been already stated that the area of the colony is
estimated to be 88,198 square miles. According to this, there
would have been, on the 31st March, 1872, 206 horses, 9 - 06 head
of cattle, 113 41 sheep, and 201 pigs, or, in all, about 126 \ head
of stock—large and small —to the square mile. Estimating the
population on the 30th of September, 1872 to have been
765,246, there would be rather more than 1 head of cattle, about
13 sheep, about a fourth of a horse, and about a fourth of a pig,
to every man, woman, and child in the colony.
MANUFACTURES, MACHINERY, &c.
MANUFACTURES.
167. An attempt is made each year to secure returns of the
manufactories and works in operation, by means of the staff
employed for collecting statistics of agriculture. Considerable
difficulty is, however, found in obtaining particulars from every
establishment, and therefore the returns under this head must be
looked upon as very much under-stating the truth.
168. The total number of establishments from which returns were
procured, for the year ending 31st March, 1872, was 1909. Of
these, 421 were connected with or dependent on agriculture, viz.:
—154 flour mills, 43 agricultural-implement manufactories, 18
bone and chemical manure manufactories, 8 biscuit manufactories,
172 corn-crushing and chaff-cutting machines, 16 malt houses, 1
starch, maizena, and oatmeal manufactory, and 9 tobacco and cigar
manufactories. Those working on raw materials, the production
of the pastoral interest, numbered 206, viz.;—27 boiling-down
establishments, 9 bedding and curled-hair works, 1 cat-gut
manufactory, 36 fellmongeries and wool-washing establishments,
4 flock manufactories, 5 glue and oil manufactories, 22 meat-curing
establishments, 1 morocco and fancy-leather manufactory, 1 parch-
ment and skin manufactory, 31 soap, candle, and tallow render-
ing works, and 69 tanneries. Works for the manufacture of food,
of which the raw material is not the produce of agriculture, and
of articles of drink, numbered 275, viz.:—l26 breweries, 13 coffee,
chocolate, and spice works, 4 confectionery manufactories, 6 dis-
tilleries, 115 derated waters and cordial manufactories, 4 jam
manufactories, 1 macaroni manufactory, 1 saccharine works, 4
sauce and pickle manufactories, and.l sugar refinery. Works for

POSTAGE.
180. A most efficient postage system exists in Victoria. The
number of post-offices in the colony at the end of 1871 was 706.
The number of inland letters was 9,900,064 f the number of inland
newspapers was 2,807,501; the number of ship letters despatched
to other colonies was 386,652; the number to Great Britain and
foreign countries was 528,182; the number of ship newspapers
despatched to other colonies was 357,531 ; the number to Great
Britain and foreign countries was 592,482; the number of ship
letters received from other colonies was 396,676; the number
from Great Britain and foreign countries was 504,592; the number
of ship newspapers received from other colonies was 246,241; the
number from Great Britain and foreign countries was 1,169,215.
The total number of letters which passed through the Post-
office during the year 1871 was thus 11,716,166 ; and the total
number of newspapers 5,172,970. The revenue of the Post-office
during the same year amounted to £165,543 125.; and the
expenditure, exclusive of the cost of steam postal communication
with Great Britain to £213,696 7s. Id.
181. The number of post-offices, the number of letters -and
newspapers which passed through them, and the income and
expenditure of the Post-office during each of the last ten years,
are shown in the following table, by reference to which it will be
seen that the greatest number of letters was transmitted in 1871,
but the greatest number of newspapers in 1865.

185. The following are the numbers and amounts of money
orders issued in Victoria, upon places within and without the
colony, during the year 1871, and the numbers and amounts of
income of all the previous years. The use of Post-office stamps for
official letters has been discontinued since the latter part of 1864.
They have since been franked by means of a departmental stamp
imprinted upon the envelopes. A further falling-off took place in
1866, in consequence of a reduction in the rates of postage on
country letters from 4d. to 2d. the half-ounce. In 1869, the
Electric Telegraph Department was merged into that of the Post-
office, and the postal revenue and expenditure of that and sub-
sequent years are swelled by the receipts and expenditure of the
Electric Telegraph. The postal fee on both town and country
letters, throughout Victoria, is now 2d. per half-ounce. The rate
for newspapers is Id.
MONEY ORDERS.
183, The money-order system was introduced in 1858, under
the provisions of an Act of the Colonial Legislature (21 Viet., No.
60). Money orders are now issued and paid at 207 places within
the colony. They are also issued upon places in Great Britain
and Ireland, New South Wales, New Zealand, South Australia,
Western Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania. Orders issued
at these places are also paid in Victoria. The total number of
orders issued since the system was founded has been 656,682, and
the amount £2,277,206 15s. lid. The total number of orders paid
during the same period has been 561,505, and the amount
£1,987,237 6s. Bd.

ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHS.
186. To Victoria the credit is due of having laid the first line
of electric telegraph in the southern hemisphere. This was the
line from Melbourne to Williamstown, which was commenced in
1853, and opened on the Ist March, 1854. There is now not only
a network of telegraphic communication between the metropolis
and every town of importance in the colony, but wires are also
carried over the borders, and connected with those of the adjacent
colonies leading to the capitals of South Australia, New South
Wales, and Queensland. A submarine telegraphic cable in place
of that laid in the year 1859, which soon became unworkable,
has also been lately laid across Bass’s Straits, from Victoria to
Tasmania, and is in successful operation.
187. The Victorian lines were all constructed and are still
worked by the Government. In consequence of this, messages on
public service of course travel free. Nearly 3500 miles of wire
were opened to the end of 1871. Along this more than 537,000
messages were transmitted within the year.
188. Telegraphic messages are sent to any station within Victoria
at the rate Of one shilling for the first ten words, and one penny for
each additional word.
189. A line of wire has been laid by the South Australian Govern-
ment across the Australian continent to Port Darwin, and this is
connected with the submarine cable to Java. By this means Vic-
toria, as well as the other Australian colonies, is now in direct

191. Railways in Victoria, except the short lines which connect
Melbourne with its suburbs on the south side of the River Yarra,
are the property of the State, and are worked by Government
officials. They were all constructed by the Government, with
the above exception, and also with that of the Melbourne and
Geelong line, and the Melbourne and Essendon line, which were
made by private companies, and afterwards purchased by the
Government.
192. Funds for the construction of the Government lines, and
also for the purchase of the Melbourne and Geelong and Mel-
bourne and Essendon lines, were provided by the issue of
debentures. Particulars respecting these loans will be found
under the heading “ Public Debt,” par. 237, post.
193. The following are the lengths of the Government lines :
* This line has lately been extended to Longwood, a further distance of about

204. In the year 1871, trains upon private lines travelled 387,634
miles, and in the year ending 30th June, 1872, trains upon
Government lines travelled 1,173,434 miles. Upwards of
1,500,000 miles are thus travelled on Victorian lines in one year.
205. It is in the contemplation
the private lines, and a Bill is
of the
about
Government to purchase
to be presented to the
legislature for that purpose. It is considered desirable that all
railways should be the property of the State, and this end will be
effected if the Bill passes.
206. Surveys have been made of new lines in various directions,
the chief being from Ballarat via Ararat to Hamilton, from Geelong
to Colac and Camperdown, from Ballarat to Maryborough, Castle-
maine to Maryborough, and from Melbourne to Sale. Works upon
some of these lines ars already commenced, and it is probable that
before five years have passed, the total number of miles of rail-
way constructed in Victoria, will not be less than a thousand.
COACHES.
207. Stage coaches, constructed upon the American principle,
run to all parts of the colony except those for which railway com-
munication is available. A large amount of capital is embarked
in this traffic.
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.
208. The value of imports in the year 1871 was below the aver-
age, and the value of exports was above it. The former was less than
in any year since 1853, except 1855 and 1867; and the latter

was higher than in any year of the same period, except 1856,1857,
and 1868.
209. The years in which the value of imports was greatest were
1854 and 1857, in both of which it exceeded £17,000,000. The
value of exports was greatest in 1856, 1857, and 1868, in all of
which it was above £15,000,000.
210. In 1853 the imports were of the enormous value of upwards
of £Bl to every man, woman, and child in the colony, and in the
subsequent year they amounted to over £66 to each inhabitant.
In 1871 they amounted to only £l6 14s. 2d. per head, which is
less than in any other year since the gold discoveries. The value
of exports per head was greatest in 1852 and 1853, in which
respectively they amounted to £56 Is. 4d. and £56 12s. 4d. Since
the discovery of gold they have never been so low in any year as
in 1870, when they only amounted to £l7 11s. 4d per head:

GOLD.
212. In the year 1871 the balance of exports over imports of gold
amounted to 1,318,208 ozs. This was in excess of the quantity
in 1870 by 105,313 ozs. In the 21 years since the first discovery
of gold in Victoria,‘the net exports of gold have amounted to
40,626,704 ozs., representing, at £4 an ounce, a value of
<£162,507,056. The following table shows the net exports in
each year.

213. In addition to the above, there was, no doubt, a considerable
quantity of Victorian gold in the custody of the Treasury, and in
the hands of the colonial banks and gold brokers, at the end • of
1871. There has also, it is certain, been a large quantity
exported by private hands during each year from the first
commencement of the gold discoveries to the present time. It is
difficult, however, to arrive at any reliable estimate of these
amounts.
WOOL.
214. During 1871 the gross exports of wool amounted to up-
wards of 76,000,000 lbs., the official value of which was about
£4,700,000. During the same year about 4,000,000 lbs., of a
value of little less than a quarter of a million sterling, were
imported by sea from the adjacent colonies. The net exports of
wool were, therefore, about 72,000,000 lbs,, valued at nearly four
and a half millions sterling.
215. The' following table shows the quantity and value of
exported wool, after deducting imports of the same, in each year,
since the founding of the colony ; also, the total during the whole
period of 35 years:—

N.B. —The imports via tbe Murray are not distinguished in the Customs returns.
They have greatly increased since the year 1863, chiefly in consequence of the
opening of the railway to Echuca. In 1870 as much as thirteen millions of pounds
weight of wool, valued at £972,000, were noted, but the real extent of importations
from the Riverina district has still to be determined.
216. The gross exports of wool during the whole period, from
1837 to 1871, amounted to 794,300,943 lbs., valued at £54,725,626 ;
the gross imports of wool (excluding those overland from River-
ina), to 37,540,918 lbs., valued at £2,304,514; the balance, there-
fore, being the quantity which passed through the Customs—
-756,760,025 lbs., of a value of £52,421,112, as shown above.
217. Several woollen mills are now in operation in the colony,
and more are projected. These establishments are still in their
infancy, and therefore the wool consumed by them has not yet
begun to tell upon the exports to any. great extent. It is pro-
bable,, however, that it will do so in a few years’ time, and that
the exports will show a falling-off accordingly.
TALLOW.
218. The exports of tallow during 1871 amounted to nearly thirty
millions of pounds weight, of a value of upwards of £464,000.
The net exports of tallow have fluctuated considerably from year
to year, but those during 1870 and 1871 have been considerably


higher than in any former years since the founding of the colony

219. The gross quantity of tallow exported in the whole 35
years has amounted to 149,361,604 lbs., and its value to
£2,260,437. The gross quantity imported in the same period has
amounted to 4,618,600 lbs., valued at £73,884. The excess of
the former over the latter, being the net exports of tallow, was
thus 144,743,004 lbs., of an official value of £2,186,553, as shown
in the table. This, however, does not —as in the case of the wool,
of which until recently there have been no local manufactures —
represent the whole quantity produced in the colony, since, for
many years past, the manufacture of soap, candles, &c., has been
a Victorian industry of considerable importance.
HIDES AND SKINS.
220. The value of hides and skins exported during 1871 was
about £40,000 ; that of those imported was about £32,000. The
net exports thus amounted, in money value, to about £BOOO.
The following table shows the value of the net exports of hides
and skins in each year from the first settlement of Port
Phillip
* In the year 1866 the Imports of Tallow exceeded the Exports by the quantity
and value shown in the columns.

was £143,416, leaving the net value of the exports at £1,448,789.
Of late years, in consequence of the large quantity tanned and
manufactured in the colony, the exports of hides and skins have
only slightly exceeded the imports.
PRESERVED PROVISIONS.
222. For some years past, preserved and salted provisions have
appeared in the lists of Victorian exports as well as imports, hut
it is only since 1868 that the former have been in excess of the
latter.

TARIFF.
224. The Victorian Tariff was changed in the year 1871, chiefly
with the view of giving direct encouragement to native industry,
by imposing import duties upon articles capable, or supposed to
be capable, of being produced within the colony.

WAGES.
226. It is a remarkable fact that the rates of wages in Victoria
have always been highest when the number of arrivals has been
greatest; and in years when immigration has fallen off there has
been a corresponding depression in the remuneration paid for
labour. Thus, in the years 1852, 1853, and 1854, in which
respectively the large numbers of 95,000, 92,000, and 83,000 immi-
grants arrived, the prices of labour were higher than at any other
period in the histoiy of the colony. In the four succeeding years,
as fewer people anived—viz., 67,000, 42,000, 74,000, and 56,000
respectively, wages ieclined somewhat, but still continued high.
Since then, only about 30,000 persons upon the average have
arrived in each year, md coincident therewith the rates of labour,
although above those obtaining in older countries, and perhaps
also higher than thosi paid in any other British colony, have
become low as compared with those which ruled when a more
active immigration prevailed. It is further worthy of remark
that the only class whom wages has not fallen to any great extent
has been that of female lomestic servants, and that the introduc-
tion of single females is lie only description of immigration which
steadily throughout the vhole period, since the gold discoveries,
has met with direct encoiragement from every Government.
227. The following are about the average rates in Melbourne,
paid at five different periods :

228. In country districts, as a rule, the rates of labour are
higher than they are in Melbourne, especially as regards skilled
artisans, whose wages, in some inland towns, are quoted as high
as 12s. per day all round. Female servants also usually receive
from £3 to £5 per annum more in the country than in the
metropolis. Miners’ wages upon the goldfields range from 355.
per week, in some localities, to 50s. in others —in all cases with-
out rations. The recognised working day of artisans and labourers
throughout Victoria is eight hours.
PRICES.
229. The following are but the average prices which have been
paid for the leading commodities in Melbourne during the same
live years for which rates of wages have been given. It may be
remarked that the prices of meat, vegetables, &c., are generally
lower in country districts than in Melbourne, but that bread and
Hour, as a rule, are cheaper in the metropolis.

230. The rent of a cottage, suitable for a labouring man and
his family, ranges in Melbourne from 3s. to 10s. per week. In
the country the rate is somewhat lower, and on the goldfields a
canvas tent is set up, or a cottage of logs or split timber, with a
bark roof, is erected upon Crown lands, so that rent is altogether
saved.
BUILDING SOCIETIES.
231. A laudable desire exists amongst all ranks in Victoria, and
particularly amongst the labouring population, to possess dwellings
of their own. To aid in this object, building societies have been
established in most parts of the colony, and have met with a large
amount of success. At the end of 1871 there were no less than
56 building societies—viz., 32 terminating and 24 permanent —in
the colony.
282. The following table shows the number of Building Societies
in Victoria, the number of members, the amount of advances, the
income, expenditure, and the assets and liabilities of these
societies:—

PUBLIC REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.
233. The revenue of Victoria is about three and a half millions
sterling per annum, and the expenditure about equal. The financial
year has recently been changed so as to end with the 30th June,
instead of the 31st December, The following are the figures for
the half-year ending 30th June, 1871: —

been already received and expended, and what is still expected, the
Under-Treasurer has been able to make the following estimate :
235. The following table shows the estimated mean population,
the amount of net revenue and net expenditure, and the rate of
each per head of the population for every year since the separation
of the colony from New South Wales. It will be seen that the
largest revenue and the largest expenditure in any year are those
estimated for the year 1871-2; also that the largest revenue and
expenditure per head of the population was in 1853, in which
year the sums raised and expended amounted to the enormous
totals of £l6 11s. 2d. and £l6 9s. 3d. respectively to each man,
woman, and child in the colony.

tion throughout, and the repayment of loans as follows :—£150,000
in 1856, £30,000 in 1857, £37,000 in 1858, and £50,000 in each
subsequent year.
PUBLIC DEBT.
237. At the end of 1871 the public debt of the colony of Vic-
toria amounted to £11,994,800. This sum consisted of the aggre-
gate of the following amounts :
Table LXl.— Public Debt, 1871.
Particulars.
The residue of a loan of £BOO,OOO, for which debentures
were issued in 1855, 1857, and 1858, to obtain funds
for the construction of waterworks to supply the
city of Melbourne and town of Geelong with water.
This loan is being paid off by annual instalments of
about £50,000 each, and the whole was extinguished
on the Ist January, 1872.
The residue of a loan of £68,100, for which debentures
were issued during 1856, to obtain funds for the pur-
chase of the privileges, rights, and property of the
Melbourne, Mount Alexander, and Murray River
Railway. Only £BOO has been repaid of this loan.
Loan limited to £8,000,000, for which debentures have
been issued from 1858 to 1865, to obtain funds for
the construction of railways.
Loan limited to £300,000, for which debentures were
issued from 1865 to 1867, to obtain funds to repair
the Melbourne and Geelong Railway, to form branch
lines, and for other purposes in connection with the
said railway.
Loan limited to £850,000, for which debentures were
issued in 1866 and 1807, to obtain funds for the com-
pletion of State railways, for the purchase of arms,
guns and ammunition, and the erection and equip-
ment of works, forts and ships, and providing other
things necessary for the defence of the colony, and
for supplying water to mining and agricultural
districts and towns.
Loan limited to £2,107,000, for which debentures were
issued in 1869 and 1870, to obtain funds for the pur-
chase and repair of the Essendon Railway, for the
construction of a railway from Essendon to the
Upper Murray, and for other railway works and
rolling stock.
Loan limited to £610,000, for which debentures were
issued in 1869, 1870, and 1871, for the completion
and construction of works for the water supply of
mining, agricultural, and other districts and towns,
and for the completion of the Alfred Graving Dock.
As much as has been required of a loan limited to
£lOO,OOO, for which debentures were issued in 1871,

240. Besides these amounts, regularly borrowed by the Govern-
ment, loans for improvements of the city of Melbourne and town
of Geelong, with the principal guaranteed out of the revenues
of the colony, were sanctioned by the following Acts: —For
Melbourne, 17th Viet., No. 13, and 18th Viet., No 21; and for
Geelong, 17th Viet., No. 23, and 18th Viet., No. 22. These were
obtained by the issue, at live per cent, discount, of debentures
bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, which was
made a first charge upon the revenues of the two corporations.
bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, which was
made a first charge upon the revenues of the two corporations.
These loans were raised in 1854-5, and were originally of the fol-
lowing amounts: —
Melbourne £525,000
Geelong 210,000
241. The Melbourne loan is now in the course of being paid off
by annual instalments of £25,000, and the Geelong loan by annual
instalments of £lO,OOO. At this rate both will lie extinguished
in the year 1875.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
242. There are two modes of local self-government existing in
Victoria, both of which are legalised and regulated by Acts of


Parliament —the one by municipalities, which are now termed
cities, towns, and boroughs; and the other by shires and road
districts.
Cities, Towns, and Boroughs.
243. Boroughs must not be of greater area than nine
square miles in extent, and must each have a population of
at least 300. No point within their limits is allowed to
be more than six miles distant from any other point. They
are governed by a council, consisting of not less than six
nor more than nine members, who elect one of their number
annually as mayor. This council have power to levy rates, make
bye-laws, compulsorily take land for permanent public works, &c.
A third of their number retires by rotation annually.
244, The council are elected by the ratepayers, who are styled
“ burgesses,” and are allowed to vote upon the following scale:—
Those having property of a rateable value of less than .£5O
—one vote.
Those having property of a rateable value of £5O, and less
than £lO0 —two votes
Those having property of a rateable value of £lOO and
upwards—three votes.
245. Rates are allowed to be levied upon all lands within the
municipal limits, except Crown property, mines, and reserves for
charitable, ecclesiastical, or educational purposes. No rate is
allowed to be less than Gd. or more than 2s. in the pound upon
the net annual value of the rateable property.
24G. The mayor is, for the time being, a justice of the peace for
the colony by virtue of his office ; he also enjoys this privilege for
one year after he ceases to be mayor; but he is only allowed to act
as such in courts of justice held within the borough to which he
belongs - . In addition to rates, revenue is derived from licenses,
tolls, fees, &c. Subsidies are also, under certain circumstances,
voted by Parliament.
247. The following table shows the number of cities, towns and
boroughs, the estimated total and annual value of rateable property
therein, and their total revenue and expenditure during each of the
last ten years. Particulars respecting the corporate towns of Mel-
bourne and Geelong are included in the table, although they are
not under the Boroughs Statute (33 Viet., No. 359), but were
incorporated by special Acts before the present system of munici-
pal government was instituted:—

248. If in a borough the annual revenue reaches £lO,OOO, it can
be proclaimed a town. If the revenue reaches £20,000 it can be
proclaimed a city. Under this provision, Fitzroy, East Colling-
wood,
towns,
Prahran, Emerald
Hill, and Richmond,
i, have become
cities.
and Ballarat and
Sandhurst have become
ROAD DISTRICTS.
249. Road districts must embrace at least 40 square miles, and
must contain rateable property whereof the net annual value is
not less than £5OOO.
250. District boards consist of six members, one-third of whom
retire annually. They are presided over by a chairman, who is
elected by the members out of their own number, and who retains
his office for one year. In electing the councillors, owners or
occupiers of rateable property of an annual value of £l5O and
upwards, are entitled to three votes ; from £lOO to £l5O annual
value to two votes; and from £lO to £lOO annual value, to one
vote.
251. District rates must not be less than 6d. nor more than 2s.
in the pound. They may be levied upon all land within the
district, with the same exceptions as regards mines, public pro-
perty, &c., as in cities, towns, and boroughs. They are levied
upon the full net annual value of all property, except Crown
lands leased for pastoral purposes only, upon which they are only
to be levied on the third part of the net annual value.
252. District boards are entitled to make bye-laws for the due
management of their respective districts, and to expend the
district revenues in constructing and keeping in repair roads and
bridges within its boundaries.


SHIRES.
253. Road districts, or other portions of country, not included in
a city, town, or borough, containing an area of not less than 100
square miles, may be proclaimed as shires, provided that their
actual revenue raised from rates not exceeding Is. in the pound
on the net annual value of property, amounts to not less than
£lOOO annually. This gives them additional privileges to those
enjoyed by road districts. The district board becomes the shire
council; the chairman receives the title of president, and is by
virtue of his office a justice of the peace within the shire to which
he belongs for the year he holds office, and for the succeeding
year. The shires are allowed to contract loans upon the security
of special rates, and have jurisdiction over pounds, commons,
slaughter-houses, &c.
254. The Governor-in-Council has power to alter and adjust the
shire boundaries, to unite several shires, and to fix the number of
councillors. These are not to exceed six, except in the case of
two or more shires being united. If two be united, the number is
not to exceed 12; if three, 18; if four, 24, &c. One-third of the
councillors retire annually.
255. The councillors are elected by the ratepayers whose qualifi-
cation is as follows: —
Those having property of a rateable value of less than £25
—one vote.
Those having property of a rateable value of £25 and less
than £so—two votes.
Those having property of a rateable value of £5O and less
than £75—three votes.
Those having property of a rateable value of £75 and
upwards —four votes.
256. The shire councils can impose rates ranging from 6d. to Is.
in the pound of the net annual value of property.
257. Shires are subsidised by Government, for the first five years
from the time they are constituted, to the extent of twice the
amount actually received by them from the proceeds of a rate not
exceeding Is. in the pound. It is, however, provided that the
whole sum so paid to shires shall not amount to more than
£160,000 annually.
258. The following table shows the number of shires and road
districts formed, the estimated total and annual value of rateable
property therein, and their revenue and expenditure during each
of the last ten years.

259. The area, number of dwellings, and population contained
in cities, towns, and boroughs, and in shires and road districts, at
the end of 1871, according to the estimates of the local authori-
ties, were as follow
her of dwellings at the end of 1871 160,000, and the total popu-
lation 750,000, it would appear from
these estimates that five-
sixths of the colony and thirty-eight thirty-ninths of the houses
it contains, are situated within the limits of local jurisdiction,
whilst twenty-two twenty-thirds of the population are enjoying
the advantages of self-government.
261. Shires and boroughs are required by law to furnish annually
to the Registrar-General such agricultural and other statistics, as
* Prior to 1863 all were road districts. In 1863 eight, in 1864 thirty-four, in
1865 forty-five, in 1866 fifty, in 1867 fifty-one, in 1868 fifty-four, in 1869 fifty-six,
in 1870 fifty-six, and in 1871 eighty-nine of the number were shires.
f The total and annual value for the year 1862 does not apply, as in other years,
to all the rateable property in the district, but only to messuages, tenements, and
dwelling-houses.

This provision does not apply to road districts, but it is anticipa-

ACCUMULATION.
BANKS.
262. There are ten banks of issue in Victoria. Of these four
are local institutions, viz., the Bank of Victoria, the Colonial
Bank of Australasia, the National Bank of Australasia, and the
Commercial Bank of Australia. The remaining six have proprie-
taries outside the colony, viz., the Bank of Australasia, the Union
Bank of Australia, the English, Scottish, and Australian Char-
tered Bank, the Oriental Bank, the London Chartered Bank, and
the Bank of New South Wales.
263. These banks are regulated under the Banks and Currency
Statute (27 Viet., No. 194). By the provisions of this Act, each
bank is compelled, under heavy penalties, to prepare and keep
weekly statements, exhibiting its assets, property, credits, and
securities, as well as its debts, engagements, and - liabilities, and
from these statements to compile quarterly a general statement
setting forth its average assets and liabilities, capital, and profits,
which is sworn to by the manager and published in the Government
Gazette. By this means the public is made acquainted with the
exact financial position of each bank four times in the course of
the year. The Act further requires a copy of the charter of each
bank, and a sworn list of the names and addresses of its pro-
prietors, to be recorded in the office of the Registrar-General;
these documents to be open for inspection at all reasonable times
upon the payment of a small fee.
264. The number of branches or agencies of these ten banks
within the colony during 1871 was 169, including the head offices.
The following were the average rates per cent, per annum of dis-
count upon local bills during the same year :-r-

266. The following particulars have been gathered from the
sworn returns of the ten banks for the last quarter of 1871: —
267. The sworn returns further show that the aggregate amount
of paid-up capital of the ten banks at the end of 1871 was
■£8,276,250; that the average rate of the last dividend declared
was 92 per cent., ranging fron 13 per cent, by the Union Bank,
12 per cent, by the Oriental Bank, 10 per cent, by the banks of
New South Wales, Victoria, and National, 8 per cent, by the
banks of Australasia, London Chartered, and Colonial, 7 per cent,
by the English, Scottish, and Australian, to 6 per cent, by the
Commercial Bank ; that the total amount of dividend declared
was £410,500; and that the amount of reserved profits at the
time of declaring the dividend was £2,091,991 Is. 4d.
SAVINGS BANKS.
268. The savings banks in Victoria are under the control of
five commissioners, who are a body politic and corporate, capable
of suing and being sued. All deposits lodged in savings banks,
and securities held by them, are vested in these commissioners.
269. The rate of interest on deposits is fixed and determined
by the commissioners, but by the Saving Banks Statute (28 Viet.,
No. 263) it must not exceed 4 per cent, per annum.
270. On the 30th June, 1871, which was the end of the savings
banks’ financial year, there were eleven savings banks in the
colony, viz., at Melbourne, Geelong, Portland, Belfast, Castlemaine,
Sandhurst, Ballarat, Maryborough, Warrnambool, Kyneton, and
Hamilton. The number of depositors in these was 21,015, and
the amount to their credit was £764,236 4s. sd. The number of
depositors increased by 454 during the financial year, but the
amount deposited fell off by £30,831 3s. 4d.
* Including notes, bills of exchange, and all stock and funded debts of every
description, except notes, bills and balances due from other banks.


271. The following table shows the number of depositors on the
30th June, 1871, and the amount of their deposits in classified

272. During the six months intervening between the end of the
financial year, and the 31st December, 1871, the number of
depositors had increased by 409. The depositors on the 31st
December numbered 21,424; of these, 12,535 were males, and
8889 were females.

POST-OFFICE SAVINGS BANKS.
274. By the Post-office Statute of 1865 (29 Yict., No. 277),
provision was made for the establishment of Post-office Savings
Banks, and for allowing interest at a rate not exceeding 4 per
cent, per annum upon deposits placed therein. (The rate of
interest is now reduced to 3 per cent.) Accordingly on the 11th
September, 1865, Post-office Savings Banks were opened at
Melbourne, Williamstown, Geelong, Ballarat, Sandhurst, Castle-
maine, Maryborough, and Beech worth, and between that date and
the close of the year at 23 other towns. The whole number of
places whereat these institutions had been established up to the
31st December, 1871, was 123.
275. The following table gives the number of Post-office Savings
Banks, the number of depositors, the amount of depositors’


282. One of the most attractive features of these societies is the
guarantee of medical attendance to members and their families.
In fact the privilege of claiming the services of a skilled profes-
sional man for oneself, wife or child, whenever ill, is alone worth
the total yearly contribution paid for that and all other benefits
combined.
283. The societies have not been in existence long enough in
Victoria to determine with certainty the law of sickness in old
age, and this is a question of the highest importance in regard to
their future working. For several years the yearly sickness in
early adult ages was about half only of the English rate, while
the capital of well managed bodies was safely invested at three
and four times the amount of home interest, and with such a
favourable condition of things the societies were justified in
allowing for the time being a considerable increase on the amount
of benefits accorded by societies at home. But within the last few
years the capital in very many cases has been by no means so
well husbanded. The claims for sickness too have in certain
societies inordinately increased. This results, no doubt, partially
from too great laxity in the admission of new members, not only
as to age, but as to health and hazardous occupations, and also
from a lack of proper vigilance in regard to sick money being
paid where, and so long only as real disablement exists. Surplus
funds also are occasionally either not invested at all or put out
at rates lower than those obtaining in England. Hence the
necessity of a perpetual watchfulness on the part of members of
friendly societies.
284. The total number of non-fatal cases of sickness experienced
during the year by these societies was GBlO, and the number of
deaths was 240. The time for which aliment was allowed was
33,301 weeks and 2 days, or 5 - 6 days to each member. The period
of sickness before death was 3509 weeks.
285. It may be remarked that all the friendly societies in
Victoria are not represented in this return, but only such as fur-
nished statements in accordance with the Friendly Societies
Statute (28 Viet., No. 254). This Act does not provide any
penalties for omitting to send returns, and therefore many of
the societies fail to supply them.
MORTGAGES AND LIENS.
280. In the year 1871 there were 4171 mortgages effected upon
land, securing a total amount of £3,250,858 7s. 4d.; also 1057
mortgages on land paid off, and releases granted, of a total amount
of £487,953 11s. 4d. During the same period 330 mortgages on
live stock were effected, by means of which sums amounting to
£506,001 16s. lid. were secured upon 865,640 sheep, 32,088

289. The clergy of all denominations throughout Victoria
registered for the celebration of marriages, numbered 612 at the
end of the year 1871.
290. The total number of buildings used for public worship in
Victoria up to the end of 1871 was 2210. Of these 1320 were
and


churches and chapels, 356 were school-houses, and 534 were
dwellings or public buildings. The approximate number of
services performed during the year was 175,935, the number of
persons for whom accommodation was provided was 346,861, and
the numbers usually attending at the principal service on the
Sabbath was 231,882.
,291. The number of Sunday-schools connected with all the
denominations at the end of 1871 was 1352. The number of
instructors in these was 11,890, of whom 5465 were males and 5901
were females. The average number of scholars attending was
104,706, of whom 47,546 were males and 50,622 were females.
The sexes of 524 teachers and 6538 scholars were not returned.
292. The number of adherents to the different denominations,

293. The population of Victoria at the end of 1871 was 752,445.
There was thus one clergyman to every 1229 of the population,
and one building used for religious worship to every 340. The
religious edifices contained accommodation for 46 per cent, of the
population. There was one Sunday-school to every 557 persons,
and the Sunday scholars amounted to about one in every seven of
the inhabitants of the colony. The number of clergymen appears
small as compared with the number of churches and chapels, but
it must be understood that in many of the country districts there
is not a service every Sunday, and sometimes not oftener than
once a month; also, that there are officials connected with many
of the denominations who, without being regularly ordained, per-
form most of the functions of clergymen, such as lay readers, local
preachers, &c. These are not included in the figures given in the
table.
PUBLIC LIBRARY, MUSEUMS, AND NATIONAL GALLERY.
294. The Melbourne Public Library was opened on the 11th
February 1856, at which time only a small portion of the building
was completed. Important additions have been made to it since,
but it is still unfinished. The total cost of the building to the end
of 1871 was nearly £lOO,OOO (£99,166 10s. 6d.). In addition to
this, sums amounting in the aggregate to £181,606 17s. lOd. have
been expended upon the purchase of books, salaries, &c., making
a total of £280,773 Bs. 4d. The whole of this amount has been
provided by the State.
295. The expenditure in 1871 upon building, maintenance, and
the purchase of books was £2977 10s.
296. The number of volumes in the Library is 73,083, of which
5932 were presented; and the remainder purchased out of the
amounts voted. Her Majesty Queen Victoria, the late Emperor of
the French, and other European potentates are amongst the donors
of books. The Library, which is open on all working days from 10
a.m. to 10 p.m., was visited during 1871 by 220,440 persons. No
charge is made for admission. With the Public Library were
incorporated the Industrial and National Museums and National
Gallery, on 4th February, 1870.
INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL MUSEUM.
297. The Museum was opened on the 7th day of September, 1870,
and it now contains 500 specimens of animal substances, 2500
specimens of vegetable substances, more than 4500 specimens of
rocks and minerals, 350 models of mining and agricultural machi-
nery, and more than 3000 specimens included in the metallurgic,
pottery, glass, and building material collections.
298. Four courses of popular lectures—treating of geology,
botany, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, language, literature,,


art, and manufactures—have been delivered. These courses were
attended by 8154 persons.
299. Systematic class instruction lias been given in mathe-
matics, practical geometry, chemistry, mineralogy, and telegraphy.
300. During 1872 the classes in mathematics and practical
geometry were attended by 41 students, the classes in chemistry
by 37 students, the classes in mineralogy by 16 students, and the
masses in telegraphy by 100 students; giving a total for the year
of 194 students.
NATIONAL GALLERY.
301. The School of Painting and Design was established in the
year 1870. In the school of painting 6 students attended, in the
school of design 35 students. The assistance of Mr. Herbert, R.A.,
and Mr. Ruskin was procured for the committee in London. The
committee granted permission to the Victorian Academy to hold
its meetings in the building, and to have an exhibition of its
paintings there.
302. During the following year, 1871, the classes largely in-
creased. In the school of painting were 20 students, in the school
of design 86. The copyright of “ Rotterdam,” by Webb, was
purchased. Prizes were given for the best crayon sketch from the
round. Valuable curiosities and Pompeian relics were purchased,
and several busts of distinguished men were ordered from
London.
303. The following paintings, drawings, &c., were purchased for
the National Gallery during the years 1870 and 1871: —

THE TECHNOLOGICAL COMMISSION.
304. The attention of the Legislative Assembly has been directed
to the necessity of promoting technological instruction. On 2nd
September, 1868, the following resolution was carried:—“That a
board be appointed, of which not less than three members of the
Legislative Assembly should be members, to promote by lectures
and otherwise, technological and industrial instruction among the
working classes, the expenditure not to exceed £200.” In pur-
suance of this resolution a commission was appointed on
the 6th January, 1869, and the vote has been since annually
continued, and increased to the sum of £5OO. The commissioners
have principally applied themselves to the forming and assisting
schools of design throughout the country. The sum of 2s. 6d. is
granted by the commissioners for each student who has attended
eight times in each quarter, and small grants have been given
towards models, drawings, &c. The schools are night schools.
Two exhibitions of the students’ drawings have been held, which
were largely attended.

PATENT OFFICE LIBRARY.
306. There is a Free Library in connection with the Patent Office
attached to the Registrar-General’s department, Melbourne. This


contains over 2000 volumes, consisting of all the publications of
the English Patent Office, and other works. Here also are on
view the various models which have been deposited at different
times by applicants for patents. This Library is open to the
public on each week day, except Saturday, between the hours of
,9 and 4, and on Saturday from 9 o’clock until noon.
NATIONAL MUSEUM.
307. The collections of the National Museum are kept in a
building attached to the Melbourne University, and are increased
from time to time by purchases and donations. This edifice was
erected at a cost of £B5OO. It is open to the public free of charge
on all week days throughout the year, except Christmas Day and
Good Friday, and in 1871 was visited by more than 84,000
persons. During the same year purchases were made to the
extent of £430 ; and the cost of maintenance, including salaries
and wages, was £ll7O. This Museum is under the direction of
one of the University Professors (Professor M‘Coy), who receives
a special salary for performing this duty, and for acting also in
the capacity of Zoologist and Palaeontologist to the Institution.
MECHANICS’ INSTITUTES, ETC.
308. There are Mechanics’ Institutes, Free Libraries, or other
institutions of a similar character, in most of the principal towns.
Some of these receive books on loan from the Melbourne Public
Library. One hundred and two of these institutions furnished
returns to the Registrar-General in 1871. Their statements show
that the sums received by them from Government up to the end
of that year amounted to £35,449 16s. 10d., and the private
contributions to £118,232 16s. 3d., and that of these amounts
£08,511 ss. Gd. had been spent on building; that the number of
volumes in all the institutions amounted to 129,953, of which
25,445 were presented by private individuals; and that the total
number of visitors during the year was over 750,000.
CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.
309. The charitable institutions in Victoria are numerous and
various. Many of them are subsidised by the State, and they are
also largely contributed to by private individuals.
310. There are 28 General Hospitals in existence, two of these
are situated in Melbourne, and one in each of the following
places:—Amherst, Ararat, Ballarat, Beechworth, Belfast, Castle-
maine, Climes, Creswick, Daylesford, Dunolly, Geelong, Hamilton,
Heathcote, Inglewood, Kilmore, Kyneton, Maldon, Mansfield,
Maryborough, Pleasant Creek, Portland, Sale, Sandhurst, Swan Hill,
W arrnambool, and Wood’s Point. Besides the general hospitals,
there is a Lying-in Hospital situated in the metropolis.


311. There are also live Benevolent Asylums, where aged and
infirm persons are received as inmates, and out-door relief is given
to the necessitous. These are situated in Ballarat, Beechworth,
Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Melbourne.
312. There is an institution in Melbourne partaking of the nature
of a Benevolent Asylum, called the Immigrants’ Home. It was
founded in the first instance for the purpose of affording relief
and accommodation to new arrivals, as its name implies; but it
now assists all who are in want, without reference to the period
of their residence in the colony.
313. There is a Protestant Orphan Asylum and also a Roman
Catholic Orphan Asylum in Melbourne, also Orphan Asylums
connected with each of those sects in Geelong, and an Orphan
Asylum at Ballarat.
314. There are four Government Hospitals for the Insane—
viz., two at Melbourne, one at Ararat, and one at Beechworth —a
Deaf and Dumb Institution, an Asylum for the Blind, an Eye and
Ear Institution, and a Hospital lor Sick Children, all in Mel-
bourne. There are four Female Refuges —viz., two in Melbourne,
one in Ballarat, and one in Geelong. There are four Free Dis-
pensaries—viz., three in Melbourne and its suburbs, and one in
Geelong. There is also the “ Melbourne Home,” an institution
for governesses, needlewomen and servants out of place; and, in
addition, there are thirty-four benevolent, philanthropic, and
kindred societies throughout the colony.
315. The Hospitals, including the Melbourne Lying-in Hospital,
at the end of 1871 had 208 wards, containing 1,970,789 cubic feet,
and made up beds for 1249 males and 548 females, or in all for
1797 patients. The number of persons who received in-door
relief during the year amounted to 12,921 —viz., 9163 males and
3758 females. During the same period' 48,965 persons of both
sexes received out-door relief.
316. The Benevolent Asylums, including the Immigrants’Home,
contained, at the end of 1871, 160 wards, with an aggregate space
of 1,140,579 cubic feet. The beds numbered 1692, of which 1140
were for males and 552 for females; 15,057 persons—viz., 12,465
males and 2592 females—passed through these institutions during
the year, and 48,884 persons were relieved out of doors.
317. The wards in the Orphan Asylums numbered 60, contain-
ing 645,392 cubic feet of space. In these 1125 beds were made
up, viz., 609 for males and 516 for females. The number of
orphans who passed through the asylums during 1871 was 1178,
viz., 701 boys and 477 girls.
318. The Hospitals for the Insane contained 109 wards, being
1,755,299 cubic feet. The institution had accommodation for 1170
males and for 808 females, or for 1978 of both sexes. The

patients treated in the Asylums in 1871 numbered 2434, viz., 1464
males and 970 females. The number remaining at the end of the
year was 1957, of whom 591 were supposed to be curable, and
1366 to be incurable.
319. There were 45 male and 31 female inmates in the Deaf
and Dumb Institution during 1871, and 64 remaining there at the
end of the year. Of the whole number who passed through, 46
were deaf and dumb from birth, and the remainder became so at
ages varying from infancy up to eight years.
320. The Refuges contained 49 rooms, with an aggregate space
of 92,250 cubic feet, and made up 162 beds. Two hundred and
seventy-three females passed through these institutions during
the year.
321. The various Benevolent Societies relieved during the year
17,927 individuals.

323. It is thus seen that the expenditure of charitable institu-
tions in 1871 exceeded the revenue by about £14,000; also, that
about 28 per cent, of the funds raised were from private sources,
the remainder being voted by Parliament.
EDUCATION.
324. The returns of education, as gathered from the last census,
give the numbers and ages of those persons who had acquired the
rudimentary arts of reading and writing, but do not supply any
particulars of the higher branches of knowledge which many such
persons also possessed. The following is a brief summary of the
result of this inquiry as regards the population, exclusive of all
persons under ten years of age: —

325. Of the children under five none were returned as being;
O
able to read and write; but 3981 of both sexes, or 34 in every
1000, were stated to be able to read. Of children between five
and ten, over 43 per cent, were able to read and write, and over
31 per cent, were able to read and not write; so that three-fourths
of the whole were able to read, and only about a fourth were
entirely uneducated.
326. Of the whole population, about three-fourths were able to
read, and nearly two-thirds to read and write. On the other
hand, about a fourth were entirely uninstructed. Of persons above
ten years of age, as shown in the table, about 1 in 12 were unable
to read, and rather more than a seventh were unable to write.
327. The period between 5 years of age and 15 is by some called
the school age. The number of children returned as existing at
that period (exclusive of the unspecified as to education) was
190,827; of these, 122,015, or 64 per cent., could read and write;
H


39,399, or about a fifth, could only read; and 29,413, or 15 per
cent., were uneducated. Taking, however, the number of children
living between the ages of 10 and 15, the proportion is as follows:
—Out of 85,208 children, as many as 76,313, or 90 per cent.,
could read and write; 6,162, or 7 per cent., could read only; and
no more than 2,733, or 3 per cent., were ignorant of the first
elements of instruction. This is a result that will bear favourable
comparison with the statistics of the best instructed countries in
the world.
828, Taking the figures relating to the youth of different
denominations between the ages of ten and fifteen, the results
revealed by the census are as follow: —-Of every 100 members of
the Church of England at that age, 89 could read and write, 8
could read only, and 3 could not read; of every 100 Presbyterians
at the same age, 93 could read and write, 5 could read only, and
2 could not read; of every 100 Wesleyans, 93 could read and
write, 6 could read only, and 1 could not read; of every 100
Independents and Baptists, 96 could read and write, 3 could read
only, and 1 could not read; of every 100 Roman Catholics, 85
could read and write, 10 could read only, and 5 could not read;
of every 100 Jews, 97 could read and write, 2 could read only,,
and 1 could not read.
UNIVERSITY.
329. The Melbourne University was established under a special
Act (16 Yict., No. 34). This Act was assented to on the 22nd
January, 1853. It provides for the appointment of a council,
consisting of twenty members (of whom sixteen at least are
obliged to be laymen), and for the election by them out of their
own body of a Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor; also, for the con-
stitution of a senate, to be presided over by a warden, which was
formed as soon as the number of graduates to the superior
degrees of Master of Arts, Doctor of Medicine, and Doctor of
Laws, amounted to not less than 100; also, for the endowment of
the University by the payment of £9OOO annually out of the
general revenue. It further provides that no religious test shall
be administered to any one to entitle him to be admitted to the
privileges and advantages of the University.
330. Royal letters patent, under the sign-manual of Her
Majesty Queen Victoria, were issued on the 14th March, 1859,
declaring that all degrees already granted, or thereafter to be
granted, by the Melbourne University, shall be recognised as
academic distinctions and rewards of merit, and shall be entitled
to rank, precedence, and consideration in the United Kingdom
and in British colonies and possessions throughout the world, as>

fully as if they had been granted by any University in the United.
Kingdom.
381. The foundation stone of the University was laid on the
3rd July, 1854, and the building was opened on the 3rd.
October in the following year.
332. The number of students who matriculated in 1871 was 93,
making a total of 526 who have matriculated since the University
was opened.

SCHOOLS.
836. Prior to the year 1862 two systems of education, named
respectively the Denominational and the National, were supported
by the State in Victoria; but in the September of that year
these were blended into one system, under the Common Schools
Act (25 Viet., No. 149). That Act, however, has recently been
repealed by the Education Act, 1872 (36 Viet., No. 447), which
came into force on the Ist January, 1873.
337. The general provisions of the Common Schools Act were
carried out by a board, styled the Board of Education. This
Board consisted of five members, and was a body corporate and
politic, capable of suing and being sued. It was provided by the
Act that no two members of the Board should be of one religious
denomination.
338. The new Act provides that the Department of Education
shall be presided over by a responsible Minister of the Crown,
styled the Minister of Public Instruction, instead of by a Board
of Education as heretofore.
339. The Instruction provided under the Act is to be secular,
compulsory and free.
340. The free subjects taught are reading, spelling, dictation,
writing, arithmetic, as far as vulgar and decimal fractions,


grammar, geography, and disciplinary exercises, also needlework
for girls. Drill and gymnastics are to be taught where practicable.
341. In addition to the above, extra subjects are allowed to
be taught and charged for to the parents at certain prescribed
rates, in no case exceeding Is. per week for each subject. The
following are the extra subjects at present on the list, and the
weekly rates of payment: —Latin, French, or any other language,
for each language, Is.; Euclid, Algebra, Trigonometry, and Ele-
ments of Natural Science, each, 6d.; Mensuration and Book-
keeping, each, 3d.; Singing and Drawing, each, 2d.
342. The compulsory clause of the Act applies to children
between six and fifteen years of age, each of whom is required to
attend at a State School for a period of sixty days in each half-
year, unless the child has already been educated up to the
standard, is under efficient instruction elsewhere, or is prevented
from attending by reason of sickness, distance or other unavoid-
able cause. A parent not sending a child to school, unless
exempted as above, is liable to a penalty of ss. for the first offence,
and 20s. for every subsequent offence, or, in default, to be im-
prisoned for a period not exceeding seven days.
343. A fee, ranging from 6d. to 2s. 6d. weekly, was charged,
under the old Act, to all children, except those whose parents
were in destitute circumstances, and these were admitted without
payment.
344. The number of Common Schools in operation at the end
of 1871 was 988, being an increase of 80 during the year.
345. The number of children on the school rolls in 1871 was
131,145, and the number in average attendance was 67,233,
against 123,385 on the rolls and 61,404 in average attendance in
the previous year.
346. The average number of children on the rolls of each
school was 136 in 1870, and 133 in 1871. The average atten-
dance at each school was 68 in 1870, and the same in 1871.
347. In 1870 4977 per cent, of the children on the roll were
in average attendance. This proportion in 1871 had increased to
51 27 per cent.
348. The number of destitute children who received free
education in 1870 was 14,012. This number had increased to
14,884 in 1871. There is reason to believe that the bounty of
the State in regard to destitute scholars is in many cases abused.
349. Returns of the sexes of the scholars in 1871 show that 54
per cent, of the whole were boys, and 46 per cent, were girls.
350. The number of teachers in 1871 was as follows: —Males,
H 94 —comprising 923 masters, 121 assistants, 150 pupil teachers;
females, 1123 —namely, 91 mistresses, 759 assistants, 273 pupil
teachers ; or, in all, 2317 instructors of both sexes.

PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
352. In addition to the schools subject to the Educational
Board, there are a number of private schools established in
different parts of the colony. Some of these are Collegiate and
Grammar Schools, and in establishments of this description a
very superior class of instruction is imparted.

at the school, is open every year to all competitors without
distinction under fourteen years of age; also one of £2O given
annually for three years to a student who is going to attend the
University. In connection with the Scotch College there is an

Rev. D. J. Draper, who perished in the ship London; it is of
the value of £25, tenable for one year. One pupil is received
to board and be taught at the Geelong Grammar School free of
charge. This privilege is granted only to a youth of ability,
industry, and steady habits—the son of poor parents.
■855. The number of private schools, other than collegiate and
grammar schools, was 1055 at the end of 1871. At 94 of these
only boys, and at 127 only girls, were educated. At the remain-
der, children of either sex were received. The number of teachers
was 2088, of whom 603 were males, and 1435 were females.
The children receiving education numbered 82,989, of whom
14,279 were boys and 18,710 were girls.
356. The following is a summary of the different description of
schools, and the teachers and scholars connected with each :
357. In the last ten years great advances have been made in
the number of schools, both public and private, and in the attend-
ance of scholars. These points will he at once observed in the

358. According to a computation made by the late Board of
Education, the children attending schools of all descriptions in the
year 1871 were in the proportion of 1 in 5-21 of the whole popu-
lation; whilst, according to the latest information in their posses-
sion, the proportions in Switzerland were 1 in 6’2; in Prussia, 1
in 6-18; in Holland, 1 in 8; and in France, 1 in 8*62 * But a
more satisfactory way of determining the prevalence of elementary
instruction is by taking the number of children at school ages,
and the proportion thereof able to read and write, as shown in
paragraph 327 ante.
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY SCHOOLS.
359. Industrial and Reformatory Schools have been established
in Victoria under the “Neglected and Criminal Childrens Act”
(27 Viet., No. 216).
360. By this Act, which became law in the middle of 1864, it
is provided that children begging or receiving alms, having no
visible means of subsistence, residing in brothels or dwelling with
bad characters, having committed a punishable offence, or being
unable to be controlled by parents, may be sent, by two or more
justices of the peace, to an industrial school, for a period of from
one to seven years. It was also provided that children, being
inmates of the Immigrants’ Home at the time of the passing of the
Act, should be transferred to the Industrial Schools.
361. The Act further provides that any child convicted of an
offence punishable by law might, at the discretion of the judge or
other officer by whom such child was convicted, be sent, at the
expiration of its sentence, to a Reformatory School, for not less
than one nor more than seven years.
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS.
362. There are nine Industrial Schools in different parts of the
colony, viz.:—One for children of both sexes, at Melbourne, and
two at Geelong; one for boys only, at Sunbury; a naval training-
ship for boys, in Hobson’s Bay; a Roman Catholic school for
girls, at Abbotsford, near Melbourne; and Roman Catholic schools
for gills, at Geelong, Ballarat, and Sandhurst.
363. These institutions contain 61 wards, with an aggregate
space of 1,094,506 cubic feet. The total number of beds they
make up is 1911, viz., 1085 for boys and 826 for girls. The total
number of children in the schools at the end of 1865 was 2440,,
viz., 1371 boys and 1069 girls. The number of children returned
was thus in excess of the number of beds.
* See Tenth Report of the Board of Education, paragraph 29.


364. The expenditure of the Industrial Schools and Reforma-
tories in 1871 amounted to about £51,000, of which all but £3500
was from Government.
REFORMATORIES.
365. There are four Reformatory Schools in the colony, viz., two
for boys, on board the hulks Success and Sir Harry Smith,
moored in Hobson’s Bay; one for girls, at Sunbury; and another
for girls at the Abbotsford Convent, near Melbourne. These
institutions contain 71 wards, with an aggregate space of 51,590
cubic feet, and make up beds for 187, viz., 135 for boys and 52
for girls. The total number of children in detention at the end
of 1871 was 179, viz., 132 boys and 47 girls.
ELECTORAL FRANCHISE,
366. Universal manhood suffrage obtains in Victoria, so far as
the Lower House, or Legislative Assembly, is concerned. Electors
for the Upper House, or Legislative Council, must either possess a
freehold property qualification of £5OO absolute or £5O annual
value, or else must be officers or retired officers in the army or
navy, members of the learned professions, or members of univer-
sities.
367. The following is the result of the last election for both
Houses, so far as the number of electors on the rolls, and the
number who recorded their votes, is concerned: —
