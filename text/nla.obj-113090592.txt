Procters, Suiikti-Scljool Officers anb fathers,
and the public generally
rli HE Committee of the Wesleyan Book Depot desire to call attention to
J- the very large and well-assorted Stock of Books, which are constantly
on hand at the Dep6t.
Not only is there a large supply of Publications from the " Wesleyan
Conference Office,” London, and the “Methodist Book Concern,” New York,
but likewise from the “Eeligious Tract Society,” and the various publishing
houses of Great Britain. The Committee are, therefore, able to offer to
Sunday-schools and the religious public (they believe) a larger Stock, and
a greater variety of Books suitable for Rewards, Libraries, and Family
Reading than any Bdokseller in the Colony.
While all the Books sold at the Depot are not Wesleyan Publications,
all are of a decidedly moral and religious character. A Minister is appointed
to the charge of the Depot whose judgment is relied upon in these respects.
The Committee desire to state distinctly, that the Prices at which the
Books are sold are—at least —as low as those of any Bookseller. They are
able to make the best arrangements for the purchase of books in the home
| markets, and are satisfied with the smallest remunerative profit.
The Committee remind their friends that they have not received sub-
-1 scriptions towards paying the working expenses of the Depot; these have
i to be paid out of the profits made in trading. They thank most heartily
j those who have given them their support, and have thus made the Depot a
j success. No effort will be wanting on their part, or that of the Book
| Steward, to deserve and secure a continuance of support.
The Committee have no personal object to gain. The design of the
Depot is to enable Schools and others to obtain Wesleyan and other suitable
I Publications ; and by the supply of these to secure some profit, which will
I be ultimately devoted to the “ Supernumerary and Ministers’ Widows’ Fund.”
Persons visiting Melbourne are invited to call and inspect the stock —
which is over .£3OOO in value—that they may be able to judge for them-
selves both as to its extent and variety.
The Committee invite attention to the Wesleyan Chronicle, published
monthly, and containing Wesleyan information from Victoria, the Colonies,
Great Britain, &c. While the circulation of the Chronicle is large,"yet it is
believed that by a slight systematic effort it might be greatly increased.
Why should not every Wesleyan family subscribe for aTcopy ?
The Committee desire to add, that a large variety of Eeligious Tracts,
from the “Conference Office” and other publishers, may always be obtained.
At present there are over 600 varieties in stock.
Catalogues, &c., may be obtained by application—with fom-penny stamp
enclosed —to the Book Steward.
Signed on behalf of the Committee,
J. S. WAUGH, Chairman.
J. HARCOURT, Secretary.

PREFACE.
The Australasian Wesleyan and General Almanack is designed to
afford ready information respecting the Wesleyan Church, and it is expected
that by a regular annual issue it will become a sort of “ manual of dates,”
especially as to Australasian Methodism.
Few persons in the colonies are able to obtain the Minutes of the English
Conference, and it is hoped that this attempt to supply the stations and
statistics of the parent Church, will insure such a sale for the Wesleyan
Almanack as to secure the Book Committee from loss.
Great pains have been taken to collect the Wesleyan and other information
within these pages, and great care has been exercised to secure correctness.
It is, however, to be expected that, with so many dates and figures, some
mistakes may have crept in; and the Editor will thank those who may be
kind enough to point out errors they may find, in order to correction in a
future issue.
While special attention has been paid to Wesleyan information, the ordinary
matters which appertain to Almanacks have not been overlooked, thus mak-
ing the Australasian Wesleyan Almanack one of the most complete, and
cheap publications of its class.
It has been found impossible to arrange the matter in every instance in
exact order; readers are, therefore, referred to the very full table of contents
for the pages in which particular items are to be found.

January, so called from the Roman Diety, Janus. In his temple he was represented
with two and sometimes with four faces—the latter very seldom. The two faces were in
opposite directions; one withered and wrinkled, indicating the past; the other youthful,
bold, and animated, representing the future. By some he was identified with Noah; by
others one of the Roman kings who was deified after his death. January has not always
been the first month of the year. The Athenians began their year in June ; the Macedonians
in September; the Romans in March, and afterwards in January; the Persians on the nth
of August; the Mexicans on 23rd February; the Mahommedans in July. In February 24,
1582, Pope Gregory introduced the New Calendar—called New Style—and ordered that
January should be the first month of the year. The Protestant countries of Europe, just
emerging from the superstitions of Popery clung to the old system of computation until 1700,
when it was generally adopted on the continent. King James in Scotland, in a.d. 1600,
proclaimed the alteration of New Year’s Day throughout his realm, but did not enforce the
change in England, when he succeeded to its throne, and it was not until 1752 that the
“old style” gave place to the new, and changed the new year from March 25, to January 1.
The 6th of January is usually called “Twelfth-day,” because of its being the 12th day
after Christmas ; also, “ Old Christmas-day, “ because during the old style the festival of
Christmas was celebrated on that day. In the Calendar it is marked as the Epiphany, from
the HGreek word meaning manifestation; and it celebrates the “manifes-
tation of Christ to the Gentiles,” the Gentiles being typified by the Wise Men of the East
who brought gifts to the infant Saviour. Romish tradition says these were kings, named
Caspar, Melchior, and Belthazar; that their remains were found by the Empress Helena ;
brought to Constantinople: thence to Milan in 1164: afterwards presented to Cologne
Cathedral; and are still regarded with great veneration. They constitute the “Three
Kings of Cologne.”

February derives its name from Februo “I purify” because in this month the Romans
offered sacrifices for the purification of their tribes, thus “Ovid” says:
“In short, with whatso’er our hearts, we hold
Are purified, was Februo. termed of old ;
Lustrations are from hence, from hence the name
Of this our month of February came.”
The Saxons called this month “Solmonath” or “pancake month,” because in it cakes were
offered to the sun; and “Sol” or “Soul” meant “food,” or cakes. It is somewhat remark-
able that the Romish and English Episcopal Churches dedicate the second day of this month
to the purification of the Virgin Mary. Is this an adaptation of the old heathen practices
of purification from which the month is named? Valentine’s Day (14th) is named after a
Presbyter who was martyred in the third century, under Claudius 11. Why this name
should be associated with the follies of that day, which better belongs to Cupid is not
known, and which are more honoured in the breach than the observing. Septuagesima and
Sexagesima mean seventy days and sixty days before Easter, and these terms are applied
to the Sundays nearest those periods.

March, is so called from Martius, the name given to this month by Romulus the founder
of the Roman Empire, in honour of his reputed father, Mars, the God of War. It was called
by the Saxons Lenct-Monath or Length-Monath, “because the dayes did then first in
length exceed the nights.” Shrove Ttiesday from Saxon, “shrive,” to confess, because
on that day Roman Catholics are required to attend confession that they may receive
absolution before Lent. Ash Wedtiesday, because penitents sprinkled ashes on their heads.

April is so called from Apcrio, to open or set forth, because of the genera! opening or
awakening of nature after its long winter sleep. The Saxons called it Osier, or Easter-monath,
because at that period they celebrated a great festival in honour of the goddess Eostre, or
Ostara, probably the same as the Astarte of the Greeks. The name, therefore, which we
five to our great Christian festival is borrowed from our Saxon ancestors’ heathen feast. The
unday next before Easter is called Palm Sunday, and commemorates the multitudes
strewing palm-branches before our Saviour on his entrance to Jerusalem. Maundy Thurs-
day, the day before Good Friday, so called from the Saxon, Maund a basket. The royal
donations to the poor are made on that day. The 23rd is dedicated to Si. George, patron
saint of England. The Greeks claimed him as the sixth martyr, and churches in Constanti-
nople were dedicated to him. The Norman kings chose him as our titular saint. The council
of Oxford, 1222, commanded his feast to be kept. Edward 111. instituted the knighthood of
which his name'and ensign is the badge. He was a native of Cappadocia, a tribune in the
army, which he resigned under Diocletian; who enraged, caused him to be beheaded. His
fight with the dragon is of course a myth.

May is believed to have derived its name from Maia tne daughter of Atlas and Pleione,

kine three times in the day.” May-day was formerly a great rural festival in which the
erection of the May-pole, dancing upon the green, and the selection of the May queen were
prominent features. Tennyson’s May queen is one of the most touching and beautiful of his
compositions, and well describes the emotions awakened in the village maiden’s breast by
the hope:
“For I shall be Queen of the May, mother.”
May 6th in the Church of England and Romish Calendars commemorates the tradition that
St. John the Evangelist was on that day sent to Rome, during the reign of Domitian, and
before the Porta Latina was chst into a caldron of boiling oil from whence he came forth
unharmed. After this miracle he was banished to Patmos.

June probably derives its name from the goddess Juno, queen of the ancient heathen
Pantheon, in whose honour Ovid says, a festival was celebrated on the Ist of this month. It
was kept by all the women, and was called Matrotmlia or Mair alia. As Juno was the
special protector of the female sex, so June was regarded as the most favourable period for
marrying. Our Saxon ancestors gave to June the name of “ IVeyde monath , because their
beasts did then weyd in the meddowes, that is to say, go to feed there.”
June Ist is dedicated to St. Nicomede, one of the martyrs who suffered during the reign
of Domitian. nth. Feast of St. Barnabas, the co-labourer of St. Paul. He is said to have
been martyred, although this is not authenticated. Tradition tells, that at Glastonbury
Abbey Church-yard, there grew a walnut tree which never budded before the Feast of St.
Barnabas, but on that day it shot forth leaves and flourished like other ordinary trees of its
species. This miraculous tree has long since gone ; and its successor, a fine old tree, shows
no such deference for St. Barnabas. In the Romish Calendar the 15th is St. Vitus’s day.
He was a Sicilian martyr, in the time of Dioclesian. Why the singular nervous disease is
called St. Vitus’s Dance is not known; it is, however, remarkable that the sensitive plant
was formerly dedicated to him. Corpus Christi day is this year on the 20th. It is the first
Thursday after Trinity Sunday. The Romish Church observes it with great ceremony, as it
celebrates their doctrine of Transubstantiation. In Roman Catholic countries the day is
one of great splendour and rejoicing: processions, music, floral decorations, and other fes-
tive demonstrations, are made. Formerly religious plays or “mysteries” were performed
by the clergy; some of these are so ancient that they can be traced back to Gregory
Nazianzen.

July, so called in honour of Julius Caesar, who was born in this month, and who during his
consulate reformed the calendar which was three months in advance of the real time. He
added 90 days to that year, making it 445 days, and adapted the year for the future to the
sun’s course. The Saxon name for July was Hen-vwnath, or Hay-monath, “because
therein they usually mowed, or made their hay harvestor as some antiquarians say, Hen-
monath means foliage month, a title very appropriate to July in Europe.

August, so called in honour of the Emperor Augustus. Its ancient name among the
Romans was Sextilis, “the sixth,” reckoning from March, which was then the first month of
the year. Augustus rectified some errors of the Calendar, and it was decreed that as he was
first admitted to the Consulate, and thrice entered the City of Rome in triumph in the
ursi a.uimu.cu 10 tne consulate, ana uincc cmcica me ui x\umc m v . P
month sextilis, and as that month had been a most fortunate one for the empire it should be
called Augustus ; hence our August. The Augustan era commenced B.C. 27. Lammas
Day, 1st —So called because the tenants of the Cathedral of York lands were bound to bring
a live lamb into church at high mass on that day. Some suppose it is so called from the
Saxon “loaf masse," so named as a thanksgiving to God for the first fruits of com. Bread
of new wheat was brought by the tenants to their lords on August Ist. This day was one of
the four great festivals of the Druids, and was by them dedicated to the fruits of the soil.
La-ith-mas —Ith meant grain, particularly wheat; mas, fruit: hence by corruption, Lam-
mas, meaning the oblation of fruit and grain. St. Bartholomew’s Day, 24th—It is believed
that he carried the gospel into Armenia, and converted the Lycaonians ; also that he
preached the gospel in India. This day is infamous for the massacre of the French Pro-
testants, in 1572. The chief Protestants were invited to Paris to celebrate the marriage of
the King of Navarre with the French king’s sister, and were solemnly pledged their safety.
The massacre commenced in the night, and 10,000 were slain in Paris. The slaughter spread
through the kingdom. Du Thou estimates the slain at 30,000; Sully, 60,000; Perefixe, a
Roman Catholic historian, at 100,000. The Pope held a jubilee, and struck a medal in
celebration of the massacre, bearing the inscription “ Hogontorum strages.” In 1662, the
Act of Uniformity in England caused the ejection of over 2000 clergymen.

The public debt of Victoria, at the end of 1864, amounted to £8,443,970,
exclusive of corporation bonds due by the towns of Melbourne and Geelong to
the amount of £385,000, which would make a grand total of £8,828,970. With

November, so called from novem , nine, being the ninth month in the Roman Calendar.
Our Saxon ancestors gave to it the name of “ Blot-fnonatk y blood-month, for at this
season they were accustomed to sacrifice many animals to their gods, also killed
many as a provision for the winter. All-Saints'-Day is celebrated on the Ist, in honour of
all saints and martyrs. It is said to have been instituted in the fourth century, but was not
kept by the Romish Church till much later. Its celebration was introduced into England
about a.d. 870. The Druids lit their sacred fire on the eve of the Ist; and the relic of this
' .. - . ... • .Ml 1 ' • • *■- Vv,r
custom, as well as of other superstitions, is still kept up in many parts of England, by the
lighting of bonfires on Halloween, or All-Hallows’-Eve, atid other customs which still obtain
on that night. All-Souls 1 -Day is celebrated by the Romish Church on the 2nd. It was
introduced in the eleventh century, and on that day extraordinary masses are said for the
deliverance of all the souls in purgatory.
WESLEYAN LITERATURE.
Dr. Jobson (book steward.) presented his statement for the year 1866, reporting that, in circu-
lation of books and in returns, the last year had been in advance of any former year. Several
important works had been issued during the past year, and several interesting books were
under consideration and in preparation for pub.ication. Ihe number of tracts circulated had
been much increased, and the character and style of the works had been greatly improved.
The total number of publications issued in the year had been four millions, one hundred and
twenty-two thousand, eight hundred. The number of periodicals circulated had been one
million, seven hundred and thirty-two thousand. Of hymn-books, two hundred and fifty-five
iiiliiiuii, 3V.VW 1 muiuu-u ctiiU illll iy-iwu 7 ——- ... ,
thousand, eight hundred. Of school and reward books, upwards of five hundred thousand.
The capital stock had been increased; and the book-room in its several departments had
been extended both at home and abroad.
Wesleyan Chaplains. —Wesleyan chaplains to the army are now duly recognised by the
Queen’s Regulations. The Lords of the Admiralty have also issued regulations, permitting
Wesleyan sailors to come ashore, when practicable, to attend Wesleyan services. At Alder-
shott, Chatham, Sheerness, Thorncliffe, Portsmouth, Parkhurst, Dublin, Curragh Camp,
and also in India, Wesleyan chaplains are now appointed.

Sundays are the four preceding Christmas-day, and signify the approach of the feast of
Christ’s nativity. The Romish Church contends that this season was instituted by St.

Saviour, has not always been kept on the 25th of this month; it certainly cannot be the true

higher than the fourth century, though some contend that it was instituted by Constantine.

Wesley sent missionaries to America August 3rd, 1769. Previously to this Philip
Embury, in 1766, Captain Webb, in 1767, and Robert Strawbridge, had commenced preaching
in New York and Maryland. America first appeared in Minutes of Conference 1770,
with the names of Boardman, Pilmoor, Williams, and King, preachers; in 1771, members
reported, 316. That year Francis Asbury (afterwards bishop) and Richard Wright left for
New York The first annual Conference was held in 1773. Embury’s congregation in
October, 1766, was five persons. The first Conference, 1773, reported 10 preachers, and u6o
members. It is expected that the Church members have increased about 300,000 since 1864,
making the total at the centenary, say 1,154,000. This does not include the South Church,
which before the rebellion numbered nearly 700,000 Church members, and 2600 ministers.
There are 23 colleges, 2 Biblical institutes, 77 seminaries, female colleges and acadamies.
The centenary was celebrated Ist October, 1866. The book concern has a capital of 837,000
dollars, employs 500 persons: 30 printing machines; has 14 periodicals, circulation,
1 , 000,000 copies per month; publishes about 2000 books.

Xi —Packets — The regulations formerly affecting foreign packets are now also applied to
inland and town packets, and a packet whether for transmission within or beyond the colony,
may be forwarded if properly prepaid and posted in accordance with the undermentioned
1 A packet may contain any number of separate books or other publications (including
printed or lithographed letters,) photographs (when not on glass or in cases containing glass),
prints or maps, and any quantity of paper, parchment or vellum, or patterns or samples of
merchandise; and the books or other publications, prints, maps, <fec., may be either printed,
written engraved, lithographed or plain, or a mixture of these, but no printed matter or prints
will be allowed except such as may be printed on paper, parchment, or vellum. Further, all
legitimate binding, mounting, or covering of a book, &c., or a portion thereof, will be allowed
whether such binding be loose or attached, as also rollers in the case of prints or maps, markers
(whether of paper or otherwise) in the case of books, and, in short, whatever is necessary for
the safe transmission of such articles, or usually appertains thereto. Patterns or samples
except such as are intended for transmission within the colony, or to the other Australian
colonies and New Zealand must not have a value of their own apart from their mere use as
patterns or samples. , ......
2 Every packet must be sent either without a cover, or in a cover open at the ends or sides
so as to admit of the enclosures being removed for examination. For the greater security
of its contents, the packet may be tied at the ends with string; but in such case the
Postmaster is authorised to cut the string, though, if he do so, he must again tie up
the packet as before. Samples of seeds, drugs, and so forth, which cannot be sent in
open covers, may be enclosed in bags of linen or other material, tied round the neck
so as to be easily loosened and refastened, or as inland packets only in closed
transparent bags ; but foreign packets must not be sent in closed bags although transparent.
3. No packet may contain anything which is sealed or otherwise closed against inspection,
nor any matter or thing not hereinbefore specified; nor must there be any letter nor any com-
munication of the nature of a letter, whether separate or otherwise, unless the whole of such
letter or communication be printed. Entries, however, merely stating who sends the book,
<tc. or to whom it is given, are not to be regarded as a letter. Indeed as respects the name
and address of the sender, not only is the writing permitted, but it is even recommended; so
that if the cover come off, or for any other reason the packet cannot be forwarded, it may be
returned. Packets containing patterns must not bear any writing other than the name and
address of the persons for whom they are intended, the name and address of the sender, a
manufacturer’s or trade mark, number, and the price of the articles.
4. Packets containing seeds, not sent as samples, may be forwarded as inland packets only;
such packets must not, however, exceed eight ounces in weight, and must be either in bags or
papers, tied so that they may be easily opened and refastened, or in closed transparent bags.

(Vote. _ It should be understood that these directions are subject to much
variation through difference of soil, position, &c. They pre-suppose the
soil and position to be favourable, and must be altered to some extent for
extremes, both of soil and position.)
January.
Kitchen Garden.— Very little can be done this month because of the
excessive heat, except in very moist situations. Where water can be obtained
young crops should be watered two or three times a week. Always water in the
evening, and be careful to keep the soil well stirred, and mulch where crops are
, uftenng from drought. L.quid manure may be used with great advantage If
the weather be favourable sow beet, broad beans, carrots (early sorts), celery
cress and mustard kidney beans, lettuce, salad, onions, early peas, kidney or
S/f A’ radish, turnips. It is almost essential that the seeds be pro-
tec^l™* he heat of the sun by boughs, litter, or other suitable materials.
™ G . ARDE f • .-Examine all tender plants, protect them from hot winds,
and keep their roots moist. Tie up plants which require it; cut away all super-
fluous shoots from shrubs ; propagate by budding and layers; look well after
roses and dahlias. Plant out in pots and well water, save‘seeds as they ripen
Kemove and store bulbs, sow a few early annuals, keep the hoe well going, and,
it possible, water regularly. ° ’

“ s °° n »?«"»” «■»>»;
Flower Garden -Dahlias, hollyhocks, liliums, and Pompon chrysan-
themums will now be in their prime; liquid manure will prolonged enhance
the beauty of these flowers; dead blooms must be picked off, or fhe plants will
be impoverished. This is the best month to sow hardy annual and perenS
flower seeds. Prepare your ground for planting shrubs! ornamental trees &c ;


if not already trenched, get it done at once. Herbaceous plants can be divided,
and planted where wanted; [carnations and pinks may still be propagated by
cuttings under a bell glass. Keep all weeds down.
Farm. —Ploughing should chiefly occupy the farmer’s attention—plough
deep, the extra expense is trifling compared with the benefits derived.
In some districts wheat sowing will commence; see that the finest and
cleanest samples are selected, and do not neglect to dress your seed by using a
solution of blue vitriol, at the rate of one pound to the sack, or some other
suitable solution. Sow lucerne, Cape barley, rye, oats, tares, and Californian
prairie grass. This is the time for preparing land to plant live fences in—quick
or whitethorn hedges are the best; the ground should be ploughed and subsoiled.
April.
Kitchen Garden. —Finish the manuring and digging of ground ere winter
sets in. Take care that young crops of turnips and carrots are kept free of
weeds. Continue planting out cabbages, cauliflower, and celery, the latter
would be much benefited by an occasional dose of guano water. Sow peas
(early varieties) broad beans, onions, parsley, endive, radish, and spinach.
Plant potato onions, shallots, garlic, rhubarb,,and horse-radish. Earth up celery
as required. Look to your herb bed; where necessary, divide the roots, and
make fresh plantations. If strawberry runners were not planted last month,
let them be this.
Flower Garden. —This is one of the busiest months in the year; most kinds
of evergreens, ornamental and flowering shrubs, are best transplanted now, and
any alterations that are to be made in the laying out of grounds should be
commenced. Take up gladioli, liliums, and other bulbs that have done flowering,
store them away in boxes packed in dry sand. Finish planting hyacinths, tulips,
crocuses, narcissi, anemones, ranunculi, ixias, &c., &c. Benovate edgings of
chamomile, thrift, box, and thyme. For new plantations of roses the ground
should be trenched and heavily manured; if light soil, some stiff loam should
be incorporated with it. Propagate by cuttings any kinds of soft wooded plants
you wish to increase; bell or hand glasses are required for this purpose.
Farm, —Oat sowing will commence in some places, but in cold districts May
or June are better months. As a general rule, however, early sowing is best.
For green feed, Cape barley and oats may be sown; lucerne, clovers, and grasses
of all kinds may be sown. Before sowing these seeds, test their germinating
powers by sowing a small sample in a flower-pot, so that expense and disappoint-
ment may be averted. Young crops of barley, oats, &c., would be much bene-
fited if a pair of lig'd harrows were run over them. Immediately potatoes are
ripe, they should be lifted and stored, as if left in the ground they are liable to a
second growth.
May.
Kitchen Garden. —Asparagus, rhubarb, and sea kale beds will now want
cleaning and manuring. Broad beans, peas, lettuce, onions, radish, and spinach
may be sown for successions! crops. Plant out early cabbages and late sowings of
celery. Finish the manuring and digging of all vacant ground, whether
wanted for immediate use or not; bear in mind that turning over ground in a
wet state does it more harm than good. If your ground is wanted for other
purposes, carrots, parsnips, and other tap-rooted vegetables may be taken up
and stored.
Flower Garden.— As dahlias and hollyhocks die off, the stalks should be
cut down and cleared away, the former should be taken up and housed in a dry
shed or cellar. Look over your seedling, annual, and other plants; thin them
where thick, and keep all slugs and vermin away. Prune perpetual flowering,
banksian, and other spring blooming roses. Continue planting all kinds of ever-
greens, flowering and ornamental shrubs, stake the same when necessary. Pro-
pagate by cuttings, fuchsias, roses, &c. Attend to your hedges, keeping them
well clipped; if new ones are required, use hawthorn, furze, osage orange, or
acacia, where strength is required; if light small hedges are wanted, the small
leaved prickly acacia, Cape broom, sweet briar, or pittosporum are the best.


Farm.—Complete your wheat sowing; also sow barley, beans, oats, peas, rye,
and vetches for seed. Finish sowing grasses, clovers, and lucerne. Store
turnips and mangolds if the ground is required for other purposes.
June.
Kitchen Garden.— Get all heavy work in the most forward state possible.
This is the best month for planting all descriptions of fruit trees; trenching and
deep draining are essential to their well-doing; if your soil is poor and manure
be needed, use bone dust in preference to guano. Commence pruning fruit trees,
beginning with those that have lost all their foliage. Sow to a limited extent
cabbages, cauliflowers, brocolis, early carrots, lettuces and radishes. Make good
sowings of broad beans, peas and leeks. Finish planting garlic, eschalots, horse-
radish, rhubarb, sea kale and asparagus-
Flower Garden.— lf possible, finish planting all kinds of trees; choose
calm dull weather for the purpose of transplanting, and take care that the roots
are mutilated as little as possible- This is a good time for sowing grass seeds
for lawns and borders. Dig neatly your flower beds, adding, if necessary, a
little well-rotted manure. Finish pruning roses, flowering shrubs, &c. Old
rose stools that have been standing for years should be taken up and thrown away,
replacing them with young vigorous plants.
Farm.— Barley and oats should be sown largely either for hay or seed. Con-
tinue sowing beans and peas. Prepare land for mangolds, carrots, potatoes,
maize, sorghum, chicory, tobacco, &c. The deeper you work your ground the
better will be your crop- On rainy days numerous jobs indoors may be done,
such as mending and making pig troughs, hurdles, gates, &c.
July. »
Kitchen Garden.— Plant largely of early potatoes; sow parsnips upon rich
deep soil, the latter ought to have been trenched two feet or more. Sow peas
largely—Bedman’s dwarf, blue imperial, Champion of England, Burbidge’s
eclipse, climax, and alliance are among the best for general purposes. Sow
largely of the various kinds of broad beans in rows thirty inches apart.
Established plantations of rhubarb and sea kale may be forced by covering the
crowns over with pots or slates and covering these again with fresh horse
manure. Plant globe artichokes in rich soil in rows four-feet six-inches by
three-feet. Sow main crops of onions, also spinach, radish, and small salads.
Flower Garden. —If last month’s directions have been carried out, there
will not remain much to be done in this, with the exception of keeping all walks,
borders and beds neat and clean.
Farm.— Continue the ploughing and harrowing of lands intended for spring
cropping. Hoe all drilled crops. Continue sowing grasses, clover, lucerne and
peas; beans may still be sowed in late localities. Oat and barley sowing should
be completed this month if the weather has been at all favourable.
August.
Kitchen Garden.-— This month will draw to a close the season for planting
fruit trees, &c., so that all diligence must be used in getting this operation over
as early as possible; in addition to this, August is the chief month for sowing
seeds of various kinds—such as cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, leek, lettuce, onion,
parsley, parsnip, peas, radish, spinach, salsafy, and scorzorzera. If frames are
obtainable, make up hot beds for early cucumbers, melons, vegetable marrows,
&c.—Tomatoes may also be sown in pots in a frame for planting out in October.
Plant Jerusalem artichokes, and the main crop of potatoes. Plant out
cabbages, cauliflowers, leeks and onions.
Flower Garden.— lf the manuring and digging of the flower garden be not
completed before now, it should be done at once: tall-growing annuals will
require tying up. Propagate fuchsias, chrysanthemums, and climbers from
cuttings. Repot any plants in pots commencing growth and wanting pot room.
Dahlias for early flowering may be started in a little bottom heat, seedling
nemophilas, larkspurs, clarkias, &c., may be transplanted if too thick.


Farm. —Potato planting may be commenced now, but September is the
principal month for getting in the main crops. English barley can still be sown.
Oat and wheat crops should be rolled. Prepare land for sorghum, beet, and
mangold crops.
September.
Kitchen Garden. —This is the busiest month in the year for seed sowing—
most of the hardy vegetables may be sown, and towards the close of the month
all the tender sorts. Potatoes of all kinds should be planted for the main crops.
Make a sowing of peas for a succession. Early long-pod beans may still be sown
in low lying ground. Sow scarlet runners, dwarf French beans, beet, carrot,
cucumber, melon, vegetable marrow, pumpkin, onion, radish, and spinach;
mustard and cress should be sown every fortnight; sow celery on a hotbed ;
tomatoes and capsicums may be sown in warm situations; if any have been raised
in a hotbed, harden a little and plant out. Plant Chinese yams and sweet
potatoes in well trenched soil. Fruit trees will require attention; with the
finger and thumb displace any superfluous shoots, and if time can be spared,
the blossom buds should be thinned, especially of young trees.
Flower Garden. —The floriculturist has generally numerous insect pests to
annoy him in this month, such as green and black fly, red spider, scale and
thrip, to say nothing of slugs, caterpillars, &c. Gishurst’s Compound will be
found to be the best remedy for the former. Plant out calceolarias, cupheas,
geraniums, heliotropes, pansies, salvias, &c. Sow both tender and hardy
annuals.
Farm. —Sow carrots, chicory, maize, mangolds, parsnips, and tobacco. Plant
potatoes ; lucerne and grasses can also still be sown. Keep the horse hoe at
work between drilled crops, and plough in weeds on fallow ground.
October.
Kitchen Garden. —lf the season is moist, carrots, leeks, onions, and par-
snip, may still be sown. Sow largely of kidney beans, early turnips, capsicums,
tomato, cucumber, vegetable marrow, pumpkins, melons, and parsley; also, tall
growing varieties of peas; they will not grow very high at this season of the year.
Plant out largely cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and celery; also, sow again for
succession. Weeds will grow apace; choose a fine sunny day for hoeing them
down, and rake off when withered, or perchance a shower may come, and a great
number of them would start into growth again.
Flower Garden.— Balsams, cockscombs, globe amaranthus, zinnias, and other
tender annuals should now be sown, if not already done —if sown in pots and
transplanted into the flower beds, place, in sunny weather, an empty flower pot
over the patches of young plants; remove the pots every evening, or the plants
will grow up weak and spindling. Climbers will be growing fast, and will require
constant trimming and training. See that the flower beds are kept filled by
turning out plants in pots.
Farm. —This is the last month that potatoes can be planted, except in low
lying lands. Sow largely of maize and sorghum; mangold sowing should also be
completed. Earth up early crops of potatoes with the double-breasted plough;
do not delay this operation, or you will injure the fibres considerably if left too
long.
November.
Kitchen Garden. —The beds of rhubarb and sea kale that have been forced
should now be cleaned off. Cease cutting asparagus or you will weaken the
roots. Attend to your cucumbers and melons; if any have missed, sow again at
once ; stop the leading shoots of cucumbers to induce laterals. If tomatoes are
not planted against a wall or fence they should be tied up to strong sticks, and
pruned moderately, or the fruit will be small and few. This is the time for pre-
venting a great deal of the ordinary pruning in winter; use the finger and thumb


judiciously in disbudding and stopping fruit trees; thin the fruit where thick ;
increased size and superior flavour will be the result. Vines will require
frequent attention as regards training, tying, and thinning the shoots.
Flower Garden.— Hybrid perpetual roses should have their shoots pruned
back immediately they have bloomed. Any newly-planted shrubs or plants
that may be suffering from hot sunshine, should be protected by boughs of tea-
tree or wattle placed round them, empty casks with both ends knocked out
make very good shelters, although rather unsightly. At the close of the
month budding may be proceeded with. Flower seeds can still be sown,
although with greater risk of their well doing than if sown earlier.
Farm. — In some districts harvesting will have commenced, and farmers
generally will have little time to attend to their growing crops of mangolds,
potatoes, &c.; but if these are neglected to be weeded and hoed, they will soon
suffer. Maize and sorghum may still be sown.
December.
Kitchen Garden.— Cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and savoy may be
sown in shady places; peas, kidney beans, lettuce, spinach, and turnips can also
be sown, but not to any extent. Onions, carrots, and parsnips will require
thinning and weeding. Matured onion bulbs should be harvested at once, or the
sun will injure them for keeping. Plant out early celery plants in trenches,
and give abundance of water when established. Early potatoes for seed, when
ripe, should be taken up and greened, by exposing them to the atmosphere for
a few days, under the protection of a shed or verandah.
Flower Garden. —All bulbs that have flowered and died away, should be
taken up and packed away in dry sand. This is the best month for planting
out dahlias for autumn blooming. Roses and fruit trees may be budded. All
newly-planted shrubs and trees will be benefited by having some stable straw,
in a pretty rotten state, spread on the surface of the soil, which should first be
well stirred.
Farm.— The wheat harvest will be getting general in the earlier districts, both
wheat and oats should be cut before being thoroughly ripe; English barley
should be fully ripe before being cut, in order that, when used for malting, it
may all sprout at once. Hoe and earth up potatoes.
