PREFACE
“They desire to see no territorial changes that do not ac-
cord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples con-
cerned,” provides the Atlantic Charter formulated by Presi-
dent Roosevelt and Premier Churchill in 1941.
In 1943 the Cairo Conference attended by President
Roosevelt, Premier Churchill, and Gen'eralissimo Chiang Kai-
shek decided to hand Formosa to China after the Japanese
surrender. Such an arbitary action was committed not in
accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the Formosan
inhabitants.
Historically, the Japanese in 1895 with brutal force oc-
cupied the island neither from the Manchus nor from the
Chinese, neither from Chiang Kai-shek nor from Mao Tse-tung,
but from its rightful inhabitants. Because the Manchu Court
ceded Formosa to Japan not in accordance with its inhabitants
wishes, the Formosans established the independent Formosan
Republic, though subsequently driven into colonial status. The
Chinese Government by its inhability to help the Formosans
resist the Japanese invaders must have forfeited any claim to it
long ago. Today the ejected regime from China seeking shel-
ter in Formosa is not entitled to administer the island s state
affairs because its status remains undecided pending the con-
clusion of the peace treaty with Japan. The Cairo decision
must be abrogated because it contradicts the Atlantic Charter.
Besides, the misgovernment of Formosa must have dis-
qualified China as a trustee power. Upon the Japanese sur-
render in August, 1945 every Formosan hoped to have liberty,
equality, and fraternity if and when reunited with China as
the people of Alsace-Lorrain with France. For five years
after VJ Day, however, the Chinese officials and soldiers have
been preaching fraternal reunion but practised colonial recon-
quest and committed all kinds of political outrages. In con-
sequence, they have lost all Formosan loyalty and enthusiasm.
Nowadays the Formosans hate the Chinese as much as the


Japanese. Not that they are revolting against China, but that
the Chinese in Formosa as represented by the worst types of
undesirables have deserted therm Having realized the futility
of any further appeal for Chinese sympathy, they prefer to
recover their independence lost in 1683 and 1895.
With their group-consciousness growing into Formosan
Nationalism, neither Chinese-made nor Japanese-imported, the
Formosan Patriots want to regain political independence
through a plebiscite under neutral supervision, failing which
recourse to arms will be the only alternative. For liberty and
prosperity they are determined to fight on even longer than
the lrish did.
What is Chiang Kai-shek, head of the Chinese Government
in Formosa? In China he abused all administrative powers,
arrogated all victory-merits, controlled the whole national
treasury, and ignored the people’s rights. When the Commun-
ists and the Democrats wanted to have peace with him, he dec-
lined their request; when the Nationalist officers and men
were tired of fighting, he ordered them to the battle-front. In
the end he incurred defeat after defeat, till his whole entourage
was wiped out of China and has sought refuge in Formosa.
In the island, though its legal status remains undecided, he has
been issuing orders and enforcing decrees, commandeering pro-
visions and conscripting labourers, like Maximilian over the
Mexicans. In China one uniformed man is supported by one
hundred civilians; in Japan and Germany one occupation
soldier, by several hundred vanquished people; but in Formosa
one refugee tyrant, by ten natives. With young and old,
women and invalids, excluded, every two able-bodied
Formosans have to house and feed one Chinese soldier. The
“war debt” Formosa is paying China far exceeds the Japanese
and the German war-reparations, indeed!
As to his henchmen and kinsmen in Formosa, their lack of
public spirit caused the speedy and spectacular collapse of the
Kuomintang Army and economy in China. After VJ Day
they boasted of the quantities of the taken-over raw materials
and finished products, trucks and boats, factories and machi


nery, but, grabbed or wasted them instead of utilizing them
for public interests and productive purposes. And, by forcing
the people to convert their gold bars and foreign currencies
into the Gold Yuan half a year before they evacuated Nanking
they stripped many earnest citizens naked. What was true in
China has been even more true in Formosa!
Unable to bear Chinese tyranny and robbery, we, Formosan
Patriots, have been for years presenting the Case of Formosa
before the civilized world for judging between the Chinese
wrong and the Formosan right and by all means attempting to
enlist foreign sympathies and contact the United Nations,
SCAP, and Governments of the Democratic World. Now that
the item, “The Question of Formosa’s Future Status,” sub-
mitted by the US Chief Delegate, Mr. Warren Austin, to the
UN General Assembly, has been placed on the agenda, the
island’s future status must be changed according to its natives’
aspirations.
Hwang Chao-ch’in, one of the new delegates whom the KMT
regime has sent to the United Nations is a Formosan but
in the capacity of the Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial
Council and Governor of a KMT-sponsored bank cannot
represent the Formosan people. It is therefore impera-
tive that facts and aspirations be fairly presented by a free
native Formosan to the United Nations, for which the present
author has written down and sent out this memorandum,
“Formosa Speaks.”
The civilized world must consider the present status of
Formosa as undecided and the ejected Chinese regime there as
gx-lex and must give the Formosans a chance to decide their
future status according to the Atlantic Charter. To uphold
international justice, the United Nations should see to it that
Lake Success become no Munich for selling a people like
chattel attached to their inhabited land. It is therefore up
to the United Nations to inaugurate an international adminis-
tration: (1) To take over the government units from the pre-
sent regime in Formosa, (2) to disarm the Chinese troops there
and employ them for labour services pending their repatriation.


(3) to release all Formosans arrested on the charge of political
treason (as the objective of Formosan loyalty remains also
undecided), and (4) to allow free political activities of differ-
ent parties in Formosa pending the holding of a plebiscite for
(a) complete independence, (b) union with CCP China, and (c)
retention of the KMT status quo.
Since only those who had been citizens of Formosa before
VJ Day will be entitled to vote during the plebiscite held
under neutral observation, we are absolutely sure an over-
whelming majority of our people will vote for complete inde-
pendence. They will become unhappy again if placed under
any foreign rule that implies the revival of colonialism against
which they have been fighting for three odd centuries. In
population (over 7,000,000) and industry (throughout Asia
only next to Japan) our country is comparable with the
majority of the independent nations in the world; in cultural
advancement (90% literacy) and social organization (well-regi-
mented and law-abiding) our people are highly qualified to
manage their own affairs and direct their future destiny.
Therefore, they must have a chance to express their joint-
wishes freely for independence in accordance with the prin-
ciple and practice of democracy.

FORMOSA, PAST AND PRESENT 1
Origins of the Country and the Pepple
In the Western Pacific
exactly opposite Fukien
Province of China there lies
an island in the shape of a
carp. It was named Pekan
by Malayan aborigines, ac-
claimed as Formosa by the
Portuguese, and has been
called Taiwan by the Chinese
literally meaning Terraced
Bay. Separated by the
Formosa Strait which varies
in width from 80 to 200 miles,
the Island is located between
21 °4s' and 25°38' north lati-
tude and 120*2' and 122°6 /
east longitude nearly on the
middle of the longest chain
of volcanic archipelagoes in
the world that ranges from
the Kamchatka Peninsula in
the north down to t’he Soenda
Islands in the south.
The volcanic range passing
through Formosa parades as
many as 48 snow-clad peaks
towering about 10,000 feet
and stretches from north
to south 249 miles or
400 km. long, thus form-
ing the most magnificent
mountain-range of East
Asia. From their sides
and feet extend basins and
plains, brooks and rivers.
The east coast as constantly-
washed by the foaming waves
of the Pacific Ocean has been
suffering territorial losses
only to be compensated by
gains on the west through the
deposit of silt carried by
muddy water. In conse-
quence, the northeastern
part of the Island came into
possession of such attractive
features that Portuguese
voyagers in 1590, when catch-
ing their first glimpse of it
and seeing the blue moun-
tain-peaks 7,000 feet in
height piercing the fleecy
clouds, exclaimed out of ad-
miration, “Ilha formosa, ilha
formosa.”
The greatest width of the
Island is 93 miles or 150 km.
only. Approximately through
it runs the Tropic of Cancer.
The total area covers 13,807

square miles or 35,760 sq. km.
about three fifths of Lake
Michigan or half the size oi
Ireland. The famous Pes-
cadores in the Formosa
Strait covers only 126.86 sq.
km. The Sakishima Archi-
pelago that lies within 75
miles to the east belongs to
the Loochoo group while to
the south across the Bashi
Channel about 100 miles in
width lies the Batan Island
of the Republic of the Philip-
pines.
Nearly half of the Island’s
total area more than 6,000
square miles —is fertile and
arable. To this promised
country came Polynesians,
Chinese, and Japanese, of
Oriental origins; Portuguese,
Spaniards, and Dutch, of
Occidental extraction. The
present-day population of
Formosa according to the
official census taken on July
1, 1946, comprises 6,041,506
Formosans and 27,787 for-
eigners including Japanese,
Korean, and other alien re-
sidents. It must have in-
creased at least by 1,000,000
since the influx of Chinese
refugees in the autumn of
1948. Thus, according to a
census taken in March, 1950,
the population was 7,454,886.
The aborigines landed
from the South Sea Islands,
but on account of racial
assimilation they number
only about 160,000 today.
Owing to the geographical
proximity of the Island
to China, the Chinese
claim to have discovered
and colonized it since
the beginning of the Chris-
tian era and have actually
predominated in race and
culture. The Japanese be-
fore their formal annexation
of the country in 1895 had
appeared largely as pirates
and traders rather than as
settlers. On the contrary,
the early Portuguese naviga-
tors attempted after 1590 a
small short-lived settlement
at Keelung to which the name
“Formosa" was first applied.
It was the Dutch who in 1624
built the first European
colony Fort Zeelandia and
were two years later followed
by the Spaniards, who built
San Salvador off Keelung
and in 1629 built Fort San
Domingo on a hilltop com-
manding the present Tamsui
Harbour.
By force of circumstances
was the Island thus from the
beginning destined to become


a spot for racial contact and
conflict, its history having
been nothing other than the
continuous struggle of a
pioneering people for liberty
and prosperity against un-
wanted intruders and unjust
rulers.
Formosa against the Dutch (1624-61)
Whereas the Portuguese
took Macao in 1557 and the
Spaniards occupied the
Philippines in 1571, the
Dutch in 1619 moved the
Head Office of the Nether-
lands East India Company
under Governor Coen to
Batavia, and three years
later sent northward a fleet
of six vessels with 2,000
soldiers aboard to contest
the supremacy on the South
China Sea against their
Portuguese and Spanish
predecessors. Unsuccessful
first in their Maccao and
later in their Pescadores
campaign, the Dutch moved
to the unclaimed island
of Formosa in August,
1624. The following year,
came a number of merchants,
technicians, and missionaries,
ready to expand foreign
trade, develop the virgin
land, and convert the natives
to Christianity. Chinese
settlers then numbered about
25,000. In 1630 construction
of Fort Zeelandia at present
Anping was completed. So
was Fort Providentia in 1650
at the present Tainan City.
The Spaniards, who start-
ed their occupation of the
northern part of Formosa
in 1626, were completely
evicted by the Dutch in 1642.
Japanese pirates and traders
contacted the Dutch authori-
ties in Formosa but failed to
establish any base there.
It was out of the persistent
struggle between the Dutch
authorities and the Chinese
settlers and their descend-
ants mixed with other
elements that the first deci-
sive international conflict
grew. At the beginning the
Dutch encouraged Chinese
immigration, providing new
arrivals with oxen, seeds, and
farming implements and
bearing all expenses for con-
structing irrigation - canals
and river-embankments. Be-
tween 1624 and 1644 there
arrived more than 25,000
Chinese households compris-
ing 100,000 new comers.
Claiming all landownershlp,


the Dutch Government allot-
ted land to each tenant ac-
cording to his industry and
ability and called an area of
about 100,000 square feet
an “acre,” from which has
been derived the Formosan
kah as the basic unit of
land-surveying. Unlike the
aborigines, the Formosan
THE OLDEST MAP OF THE FAR EAST.

Chinese wanted landowner-
ship, which right the Dutch
always refused. They want-
ed to grow rice more than
sugar-cane, but the Dutch
preferred sugar to rice, so
that in 1640 the country pro-
duced between 70,000 and
80,000 piculs of sugar.
In view of the ever-increas-
ing number of Chinese ele-
ments the Dutch in 1651
began to collect poll-tax
from every Formosan of
Chinese extraction above
six years of age whereby the
annual revenue would be
increased by 70,000 guilders.
Unable to bear taxation and
oppression, the Formosans
in 1652 under a certain Kuo
Huai-i’s leadership launched
an open rebellion, which
marked their first armed
struggle for liberation
against unjust rulers. With
more than 4,000 men, women,
and children massacred the


rebellion was crushed almost
immediately.
Yet Dutch missionaries
sent to Formosa seemed able
and successful. While preach-
ing Christianity and practis-
ing Western medicine, thev
developed intimate contact
with aborigines and avoided
conflict with Chinese set-
tlers. Making cultural con-
tributions to the people, they
were also instrumental in
making the Island known to
the Occident. Thus, the first
missionary Rev. Georgius
Candidius, who came to
Formosa in 1627, wrote in
1629 and published in 1647
“A Short Account of the
Island of Formosa” and
within the first 16 months of
his stay converted 120
natives to Christianity. In
memory of his pioneering
evangelic work both Dutch
missionaries and aboriginal
converts named the mountain
lake, Sun and Moon, in the
heart of the Island after
him, which most scholarly
maps in European languages
still call Lake Candidius.
For administrative failure
missionary success could
hardly compensate. The
Dutch Government discri-
minated against the For-
mosan Chinese who were
treated like the aborigines
but in addition had to pay
higher taxes and render
more labour services than
either group. Consequently,
an old hatred was revived.
In 1660 a native of Tungan
named Ho Pin, who had been
the Chief Accountant and
Interpreter under Governor
Coyett, forced to flee because
of a deficit in public funds,
sailed across the Formosa
Strait to persuade Koxinga
in Amoy to expel the Dutch
and liberate the Chinese
settlers.
The following year, when
Koxinga and his troops ap-
peared on the Formosan
shore, all the malcontents
responded from inside and
helped terminate the 37
years' Dutch rule in the
Island. After eight months'
siege, Fort Zeelandia fell.
Governor Coyett was per-
mitted to lead his com-
patriots to embark on their
own repatriation vessels with
personal belongings and go-
ernmental documents and
sail back to Java at the be-
ginning of 1662. In 1663 the
Dutch Government of Java
and the Manchu Court at
Peking collaborated to retake
Formosa, but their joint-plan
failed to make any progress.


Formosa for the Mings (1661-83)
In Formosa the Ming au-
thorities showed little in-
terest. Yet by the Manchu
invasion in China and the
Dutch oppression in Formosa
was the Island about the
middle of the 17th century
converted into a haven for
Chinese patriots and the last
hope of the Ming Throne. In
1644, when the Manchus
started to descend upon
China Proper, the people of
South Fukien and East
Kwangtung under the lead-
ership of Koxinga and his
clansmen, prepared a war of
resistance, which lasted from
1644 to 1661 in China and
from 1661 to 1683 with
Formosa as their base of
operation.
In 1624, the same year
when the Dutch occupied
Formosa, was Koxinga born
of a Chinese father and a
Japanese mother. His father,
Cheng Chi-lung, intelligent
and ambitious but restless
and reckless, became a
pirate chief before he was
30 years old with his base
established in Formosa.
Therefore for years the
Dutch had to keep friendly
terms with him. In 1628 he
enlisted in the service of the
Ming forces and two years
later on account of his dis-
tinguished services to the
Ming Empire in suppressing
many pirates was appointed
Admiral and Chief Comman-
der of the Imperial Ming
Navy. He built his head-
quarters at Anping on the
Fukien seaboard.
Following the fall of
Nanking in 1645, the Chengs
installed Prince T’ang on the
Ming throne at Foochow at
the beginning of 1646, when
Cheng Chi-lung was vested
with all powers. Meanwhile,
Cheng Chi-lung brought his
eldest son then in his 22nd
year into audience with the
Throne. So impressed was
the Emperor by the young
man that he conferred on
him the State Surname, Chu,
and the personal name,
Ch’eng-kung, and made him
Commander of the Imperial
Body-Guard and the Count
of Loyalty and Filial Piety
with the rank of an Imperial
Son-in-Law. Ever since
Cheng Ch’eng-kung has been
known as Kok Seng Ya in
Amoy, Kuo Hsing Ye in
mandarin, and Koxinga in
Western languages, meaning
State-Surname-Bearer.


As to Koxinga’s father,
Cheng Chi-lung, the older he
grew the more greedy he be-
came after money and power
and the more fearful of hard-
ship and adventure. After
Prince T’ang’s death in the
autumn of 1646 he surrender-
ed himself to the M'anchus.
With his clansmen Koxinga
supported Prince Kwei as
the Ming Emperor. They
assembled increasing loyalist
forces in the Amoy area,
and prepared for a campaign
against the Manchu invaders.
When a northern expedition
was ready in the autumn of
1657, he was made Imperial
Prince of Yenping and Com-
mander-In-Chief of Punitive
Forces by the Ming Throne.
In the summer of 1659 the
Ming patriots took Kuachow,
Chinkiang, and Wuhu to
converge on the city of Nan-
king. During the siege,
Koxinga decided to wait for
the city to surrender. But
on his birthday his men were
caught unprepared and rout-
ed. Homeward to Amoy he
had to lead his scattered
forces.
Invincible on the seas but
always short of man-power
and material resources,
Koxinga realized the need
for more men and more
territory. As persuaded by
Ho Pin to take Formosa,
early in 1661 he left his eld-
est son, Cheng Ching, in
charge of Amoy and per-
sonally commanded a fleet
of 100 vessels with 26 gen-
erals and 25,000 of his best
troops aboard and at once
seized the Pescadores. In
May, 1661 his men landed
beneath Fort Providentia and
after a three-day battle oc-
cupied it. With the fall of
Fort Zeelandia eight months
later the Mings gained
complete control of Formosa
and converted the Island into
an independent sovereign
State —the Ming Empire in
Formosa. They immediate-
ly worked on reclamation,
reconstruction, and rehabili-
tation projects, and estab-
lished all cultural institu-
tions after Ming patterns.
In the summer of 1662,
Koxinga died of a sudden
illness in Formosa and
Prince Kwei was murdered
in Yunnan.
Cheng Ching, Koxinga’s
eldest son and successor, was
less aggressive as a soldier
but more benign as a states-
man determined to realize
his father’s unrealized ambi


tion. For more than two
decades thenceforth, the
war-situation across the For-
mosa Strait between the
Mings with Formosa as their
citadel and the Manchus
with China as the bulk of
their newly built Empire was
similar to that between
Sardinia and Italy at the
middle of the 19th century.
Just as the Sardinian soldiers
and sailors won victory after
victory for the House of
Savoy, so did the Formosan
Army and Navy fight for the
already fallen Ming Dynas-
ty against foreign invaders
—for Chinese nationalism
against Manchu imperialism.
By 1676, the Formosans
had recovered the Ming
Empire to the extent of not
only Taiwan and Fukien but
also a great portion of
Kwangtung and parts of
Chekiang and Kiangsi Pro-
vinces. Early in winter a rare
snowfall in North Fukien
cut short the comeback cam-
paign, till most of the re-
covered strongholds on the
mainland were against lost to
the Manchus.
Meanwhile, the Manchus
attempted to lure the young
Prince into capitulation.
Every offer, however, was
turned down.
Early in 1680 Cheng Ching
repatriated all his followers
to Formosa. Early the next
year he died. His eldest son
and successor, Ch’eng K’e-
ts’ang, shrewd and able, was
not liked by most of his
decrepit and self-seeking
followers, and was soon re>-
placed by his second son
Cheng K’e-shuang then in
his 12th year. The enemy at
once poured in secret agents
to attempt espionage and
sabotage, arson and assas-
sination.
Early in 1683, the Manchus
signed a secret “Lend-Lease
Pact” with the Dutch against
their common enemy—the
Ming patriots in Formosa.
For naval aid to the Manchus
in the Formosa campaign
the Dutch were to enjoy pre-
ference in China’s overseas
trade. When the Manchu
fleet appeared within sight
from the Pescadores, the
Formosan defenders actually
saw enemy vessels manned
and cannon operated by
“red-haired” crew. A sudden
change of the direction of a
gale finally turned the tide
of the naval engagement in
favour of the Manchus. The
Ming fleet was practically
annihilated. When the in-


vaders landed on the For-
mosan shore, the boy Prince
of Yenping supported by
loyal but decrepit followers
had no alternative but to sur-
render with nine Ming
princes to the Manchus.
Thus ended the Formosans’
40-year open struggle for the
Ming cause.
Formosa against the Manchus (1683-1895)
Against the Manchu in-
vaders and usurpers, the
Formosans carried on their
struggle for liberation much
longer and more often than
the Chinese in China by
“launching one disturbance
every three years and one
rebellion every five years.”
By the Manchu malad-
ministration of the coastal
provinces were the maritime
inhabitants provoked to
migrate and rebel. As early
as 1661, the Manchu Court
proclaimed the Overseas Pro-
hibition Law, evacuating all
inhabitants of the sea-coast
ranging from Nanking to
Canton to the interior beyond
30 li from the open sea. In
1684 this law was replaced by
a Migration Prohibition Law
forbidding migration from
China to Formosa as the
Manchus wanted quick re-
habilitation of the coastal
districts. In 1722 another
Migration Prohibition Law
forbidding migration from
plains to mountains inside
the Island was proclaimed.
In consequence, the more
such laws were made, the
more criminals appeared.
By crossing the Formosa
Strait and settling in a wild
country, Chinese immigrants
led a very different life from
their cousins left behind. In
Formosa they worked as
pioneers in constant contact
and conflict with aboriginal
tribesmen and therefore had
to be very alert and ever-
ready for action. In no time
they became far more alert,
frugal and industrious than
the people in China. Mean-
while, owing to their industry
and patience wildernesses be-
came thriving plantations;
forests and jungles were
cleared; dikes and canals,
constructed; houses and
camps, built; villages and
cities, organized; mines,
opened; hillsides, covered
with tea and bamboo groves;
and such profitable indus-
tries as the manufactures of
salt, sugar, and camphor per-


fume, carried on. Thus,
within two centuries the
Island became as well deve-
loped as and possessed of
greater man-power and
material resources than any
province of China.
As the Formosans strug-
gled to exploit nature, so
did the Manchus endeavour
to exploit culture. Isolated
from the Central Govern-
ment in Peking, their in-
cumbents often abused their
powers in exploiting the
ignorant and massacring e
innocent. "From the high-
est to the lowest,” wrote Ke\.
G. L. MaKay, "every Chinese
official in Formosa has an
itching palm, and the exer-
cise of official functions is
always corrupted by money
bribes. The mandarine sup-
plements his income by
‘squeezing’ his attendants
and every man who comes
within his grasp. His at-
tendants have the privilege
of recouping themselves by
‘squeezing’ all who through
them seek favours from the
mandarin. In the matter of
bribing and boodling the
Chinese official in Formosa
could give points to the
most accomplished office-
seekers and money-grabbers
in Washington or Ottawa.”
Hence the Formosan say-
ing:* “The wealth accumu-
lated during one’s tenure is
too much for three genera-
tions to treasure.”
The last but not the least
important factor of constant
Formosan insurgency against
the Manchus was the seeds of
Ming patriotism sown by
Koxinga and his compatriots
—organized into the Ming
Loyalist Society—among the
social substrata, which when
under no ideological leader
and political organizer often
took the form of uprisings
for secessionism. None the
less, the three biggest re-
volutions that spread over
the whole Island hoisted the
Ming flag, revived the lost
cause, and swore Ming re-
naissance : the first was
launched by Chu I-kuei in
1721, the second by Lin
Shuang-wen in 1786, and the
last by Tai Wan-sheng in
1861. The basic cause of
their failure was their in-
ability to capture the Man-
chu navy and construct their
own in order to expel unjust
rulers and repel unwanted
intruders.
To heal old scars, the Man-
chus made Formosa into a

province in 1885 with General
Liu Ming-ch’uan as governor.
He started to build a modern
arsenal, a telegraph office, a
post office, and a railway
from Keelung to Sinchu.
When defeated by the Japan-
ese in 1894 and 1895, the
Manchu envoy, Li Hung-
chang, in the Treaty of
Shimonoseki ceded Formosa
to Japan. Resenting the
Manchus’ “robbery of Peter
to pay Paul,” the Formosans
protested the unjust and
arbitrary action of their
age-long enemy. Opposing
the territorial change against
their wishes, they declared
independence and organized
the Formosan Democratic
Republic and elected first the
then governor T’ang Ching-
sung and later Liu Yung-fu
as President. They fought
a war of independence open-
ly for half a year. This
ended the last phase of the
Formosan struggle against
the Manchus but opened the
first page of the same strug-
gle against the Japanese.
Formosa against the Japanese (1895-1945)
By the War of Indepen-
dence was established suffi-
cient historical evidence that
the Japanese stole the Island
of Formosa neither from the
Manchus nor from the Chin-
ese but from its rightful
inhabitants. Despite the
Japanese high-handed poli-
cies the Formosans con-
tinued their struggle for
liberation by launching 15
atmed uprisings within half
a century.
With their habitual indus-
try and patience the Jap-
anese converted the hitherto
medieval colony by turning
it first into a silo, then
into a workshop, and finally
into a warmachine. To have
docile farmers and efficient
workers, they started regi-
menting all the people into
civic groups, improving their
living and sanitary condi-
tions, and training their able-
bodied men. To increase
agricultural productions they
facilitated all means of irri-
gation, fertilization, and com-
munication ; to promote
manufacture-industries they
gave Japanese capitalists
and experts special pri-
vileges while training For-
mosan mechanics and work-
men all for practical
purposes. As a result,
the sugar-industry, for exam-

pie, progressed by leaps
and bounds, till it reached
the maximum production of
1,400,000 tons in 1940-41 and
Formosa became the fifth
sugar-producing country on
earth.
An economic success as it
was, it amounted to a moral
failure. For by virtue of
police terrorization, verbal
intimidation, or circumstan-
tial embarrassment the Jap-
anese - owned and - operated
sugar mills often compelled
landowners to sell farms at
their lowest prices. So did
they buy the sugar-cane.
But they would sell the
manufactured product at
their own highest price.
Hence the rise of many con-
flicts.
Like the Manchus, the
Japanese were guilty of the
master-race theory and prac-
tice. To the Formosans,
whose hearts they never suc-
ceeded in winning, gain of
material prosperity could
hardly compensate for loss
of spiritual liberty. For in-
stance, throughout the entire
Japanese reign police-sta-
tions and policemen always
outnumbered schools and


teachers; prostitutes out-
numbered nurses. After the
outbreak of the Mukden In-
cident in 1931, they suddenly
attempted to replace the
policy of discrimination and
isolation with that of equali-
zation and assimilation when
the Formosan racial hatred
had already oecome too-
deeply-rooted-
As in China so in Formosa
most of the political dis-
turbances were engineered
by members of secret
societies which had grown
out of the early Ming Loyal-
ist Society. Right after the
overthrow of the Manchu
regime such adventurers
started smuggling arms and
munitions into Formosa and
fomented the last and big-
gest war of independence
against the Japanese in 1915
with a view to founding the
Great Ming State of Mercy
under the leadership of Yu
Ch’ing-fang, Chiang Ting,
and Lo Tsun. It took the
Japanese several months and
several regiments to quell
the rebellion through the
worst atrocities.
Giving up the idea of
armed struggle against alien
rulers, enlightened elements,
headed by Lin Hsien-t’ang,
Chiang Wei-shui, etc. and
inspired by Wilson’s doctrine
of racial self-determination,
launched a self-government
movement in 1920. Spon-
sored by several liberal Jap-
anese, a petition for the
establishment of a colonial
parliament was presented to
the Japanese Cabinet. To
the Imperial Diet the matter
was too insignificant to de-
serve any debate; to the Jap-
anese Governor of Formosa
1895 ISSUE OF POSTAGE STAMPS BY FORMOSAN REPUBLIC.


it was too serious to be
ignored. Hence the expan-
sion of secret service and
thought control in the
Island; which system of re-
striction and surveillance
grew into totalitarianism,
driving all malcontents
underground or out of the
country.
After VJ Day many For-
mosan patriots reappeared
from underground or re-
turned from abroad—from
Free China in particular—
to expel the Japanese and
welcome the Chinese. Once
reunited with the Chinese,
the Formosans hoped to at-
tain both material prosperity
and spiritual liberty, enjoy-
ing the same liberty, the
same equality, and the same
fraternity with them as the
people of Alsace-Lorraine
with the rest of the French.
Formosa against Ch*en Yi (Oct. 24, 1945-May 10, 1947)
Like the Koreans, the
Formosans who had found
common foes in the Manchus
and the Japanese for three
centuries as the Chinese had
done, naturally looked to
China for material aid and
moral sympathy. Yet it was
the Americans who brought
the Japanese to their knees
and after VJ Day the Chin-
ese take-over officials and
occupation forces across the
Formosa Strait, Still on
greeting the first groups of
Chinese the Formosans re-
vealed unlimited loyalty and
enthusiasm, not foreknowing
that the more their expecta-
tion was, the worse them
disappointment would be.
Unfortunately, the first
Chinese Administrator-Gen-
eral Ch’en Yi and his sub-
ordinates, while lacking- the
Japanese ability to recon-
struct the country and
rehabilitate the people, open-
ly revived the former high-
handed policy of control
and Carpet-Baggers appear-
ed in enormous numbers to
devastate the Island; so that
within half a year unlimited
enthusiasm turned into
irrevocable antagonism.
For instance, crooked
merchants exchanged Chin-
ese notes for the Formosan
Yen at par and thereby
reaped a 4,000% profit,
mixed salted fish with
stones, and put sand in f o
patent - medicine - bottles;
soldiers would buy without
paying and ride with no


ticket; military trucks often
hit and ran; and married
men often talked Formosan
girls into marriage and then
ran away with their doweries.
As to the take-over officials,
those never guilty of graft
were few and far between.
All profitable imports and
exports were transacted by
the Bureau of Trades; all
profitable industries, by that
of Monopolies, In August,
1946 the Commissioners of
both Bureaux were found to
be the wmrst grabbers and
prosecuted by General Liu
Wen-tao but after brief de-
tention were released by
General Ch’en Yi’s order on
account of lack of evidence.
Inflation has been the only
productive industry intro-
duced by the Chinese Nation-
alists into Formosa; gam-
bling and feasting, their
sports- Suddenly the For-
mosans, who had expected
the Confucian W?.y of Right
to replace the Bushida of
Might, found themselves
driven into the KMT “Way
of Bite.”
The fuse of the island-
wide opposition to Chinese
tyranny and robbery was
finally lit not by a Formosan
but by a Chinese. This man,
an anti-smuggling officer of
the Monopoly Bureau, seized
the cigarette tray of an old
Formosan woman selling
imported cigarettes, and shot
to death a Formosan civilian
on the evening of February
27, 1947. Early the next
morning, unarmed For-
mosans formed two proces-
sions, one going to the Mono-
poly Bureau and the other
to the Tobacco Monopoly
Building. Spurned by the
monopoly officials, the
former group went to peti-
tion the Office of the Admin-
istrator-General for justice
and relief. When they ar-
rived within reach, guards at
the entrance opened five. By
the momefit four Formosans
were killed and 11 wounded,
a brave youth rushed at the
Chinese machinegunners,
turned the weapon, and
scared them off. '“They
have made no difference
between patriots and rebels-
Let’s make no difference
between wolves and lambs,
either. Just grab and beat
any of them,” he said to the
enraged crowd.
Meanwhile, Ch’en Yi pro-
mised relief and leniency and
permitted meetings to be
held for a peaceful settle-
ment while in secret he
radioed Chiang Kai-shek for


reinforcements. Soon open
and often armed struggles
against the unwanted in-
truders were launched every-
where throughout Formosa,
so that for one full week the
country was “self-liberated”
for the first time since
Koxinga’s grandson’s surren-
der to the Manchus.
On March 8, when sure of
Chiang Kai-shek’s reinforce-
ments arriving, Ch’en Yi
forbade any more meeting.
From the night of March 8
to that of March 13 new ar-
rivals and the old garrisons
under the warlord’s com-
mand shot, looted, arrested,
and imprisoned many in-
nocent people, almost inun-
dating such cities, as Taipeh,
Keelung, and Kaohsiung with
Formosan blood which,
ironically enough, the Chin-
ese claimed to be “Chinese
blood.”
Under the pressure of
public opinion in China and
the rest of the world, Nan-
king sent out Defence Minis-
ter Pai Tsung-hsi on March
18 to comfort the Formosans
and on March 22 decided to
recall Ch’en Yi. But the
choice of the next governor,
Dr. Wei Tao-ming, was not
announced until a month
later. Pathetically, the For-
mosans delivered by the
Cairo Conference from one
enslavement to another had
to struggle further for
liberation.
Formosa against Wei Tao-ming (May 15, 1947-Jan. 5, 1949)
To appease the native
malcontents, Nanking in-
cluded seven Formosans
among the 15 members of
the reorganized provincial
government. The Finance
Commissioner Yen Chia-kan,
the Garrison Commander
P’eng Meng-ch’ih, and bank-
governors like Hwang Chao-
ch’in and Lin Hsien-t’ang
were, however, all Ch’en Yi’s
trusted henchmen, so that
from the outset Wei ran an
almost impotent administra-
tion.
In fact, convinced that the
loss of civic freedom was the
appropriate penalty for the
February 28 Incident, the new
rulers launched an absolute
suppression of free press,
free speech and free associa-
tion. To them this was a
condition of their domination
and existence in the Island.
To shake off their predeces-
sors’ responsibility for the
incident, they found 30
scapegoats charged for in-
ternal disturbances whose
arrest the Taiwan Provincial


High Court announced on
June 5, 1947.
The most notorious event
during Dr. Wei’s tenure of
office was the war of words
he waged against not only
Formosan patriots but also
Chinese critics and foreign
observers. In the summer
and autumn of 1947, For-
mosan desires for secession
often appeared in Chinese
and foreign periodicals.
While Nanking uttered no
official comment on the
subject, all influential
papers in China repeatedly
published discussions on the
history and geography,
people and culture, of the
Loochoo Archipelago, agitat-
ing for the retrocession of the
maritime country and pro-
mising the people local auto-
nomy. Even the People’s
Political Council in Nanking
and the Taiwan Provincial
Council under Chairman
Hwang Chao-ch’in passed a
resolution to demand the re-
trocession and had it in-
cluded in the Chinese agenda
for the Japanese Peace Con-
ference. On November 2,
1947 the American-owned
Manila Daily Bulletin pub-
lished the news that the
Philippines would- oppose
China’s claim to the Okinawa
Islands but, instead, would
request a plebiscite for the
Formosans to determine their
future status. Inside For-
mosa all government-spon-
sored organizations and
papers poured out protests
against such Filipino asser-
tions.
On November 15, 1947
there appeared in The China
Weekly Review D. Y. Lanne’s
‘The Kuomintang in Tai-
wan,” in which he compared
Ch’en Yi to a tiger and Wei
Tao-ming to a hyena but in
whose conclusion he advised
the Formosan patriots to
stay with China to cooperate
with all Chinese reformers.
Simultaneously from Novem-
ber 4 to 30 Mao Tzu-pei in
Shanghai published in his
Tieh Pao a series of reports
entitled “Formosa Today”
condemning Wei Tao-ming as
a lazy-bones and his wife as
a busy-body and denouncing
their joint-misrule as bitter-
ly as any native critic or for-
eign observer would do.
Provoked thereby to ac-
cept the challenge, Dr. Wei
on December 3 at the Provin-
cial Council meeting at-
tempted to sweep off what he
denounced as libel charges,
groundless rumours, and ma-
licious accusations, and had


copies of the text of his re-
futation circulated by the
Taiwan Propaganda Bureau.
About the same time his wife
filed a libel suit against Mao
Tzu-pei with the Shanghai
District Court. The suit
ended in July, 1948 in the
sentence of the defendant to
to a 2-month jail term or a
fine of CNC SIO,OOO
(USSO.2O) per day instead.
As the verbal war in
Formosa calmed down, the
civil war in China grew with
mounting intensity. On Dec-
ember 30, 1948 President
Chiang Kai-shek announced
the replacement of Dr. Wei
Tao-ming with General Ch’en
Ch’eng as Taiwan Governor
with a view to converting the
Island into the last KMT
citadel.
Formosa against Ch’en Ch’eng (Jan. 5, 194.9-Dec. 21, 1949)
With gunfire resounding
all over North China and
Communist troops converg-
ing on Nanking, many KMT
partisans and anti-CCP ele-
ments naturally looked to
the new Taiwan Governor
for a new but successful
Koxinga in a comeback cam-
paign. To glorify his new
rule beforehand, he called
Ch’en Yi’s rule ‘‘Japanese
Collectivism,” Wei Tao-
ming’s “American Liberal-
ism,” and pledged to carry
out his “Fabian Socialism,”
which in practice turned out
to be “Chinese Machiavel-
lism.”
On the official pay-roll he
at once listed so many high-
ranking refugees by creating
so many new posts. Wealthy
refugees soon started their
speculative business; lowly
elements like SS men and
Special Tribunal staff mem-
bers resumed their old pro-
fession through blackmailing
and extortion, robbery and
kidnapping.
To stabilize the economic
situation Ch’en Ch’eng at-
tempted his currency-reform
and rent-reduction. In June,
1949 he pegged the Old Tai-
wan Yen at 200,000 and the
New TY at 5 to one US Dol-
lar only to boost up com-
modity-prices. He raided
many underground banks
only to let SS men gain
20% of the confiscated arti-
cles as reward. While rent
was reduced, taxes were in-
creased, so that many land-
lords were driven to the
verge of bankruptcy. The


actual farmers enabled to
receive 62.5% of every crop
instead of 50% have been
required to exchange rice
for fertilizer with the price
of the latter raised four
times the international
market-quotation, wherefore
they have not been better off
than before, either. In fact,
Ch’en Ch’eng aimed thereby
to shift the focus of Formo-
san resentment from KMT
officialdom to native land-
lords and capitalists but to
no avail.
After the fall of Shanghai
in May, 1949 Chiang Kai-
shek sheltered himself in
the island-citadel. So did
over 300,000 of his defeated
troops. Effective from the
end of June, the KMT re-
gime proclaimed coastal
blockade with Formosa as
its central base.
Early in July, Chiang was
invited by President Quirino
of the Philippines to Baguio,
where he proposed an alli-
ance. One month later, he
flew to South Korea to re-
peat the same attempt only
to see himself written off by
the White Paper.
Curiously enough, an
island-wide mass-arrest be-
gan almost as soon as he re-
turned to Formosa, to which
fell victims Communists,
Democratic Leaguers, and
anti-Chinese elements. In
most cases more wrong than
right ones were caught; for
the SS men have been too
negligent of matters of evid-
ence and too susceptible to
bribery.
By the removal of the KMT
Capital to Taipeh on Decem-
ber 8, 1949 and the subse-
quent arrival of the Korean
and US Embassies was For-
mosa both disguised as
“China” and again converted
into an independent sovereign
State as in 1661 though now
under an assumed name.
The KMT authorities, fore-
seeing their imminent failure
unless armed with native co-
operation and further US
aid, decided to recruit 4,500
well - educated Formosan
youths for officer-training
by December 15 and 35,000
able-bodied men by March
15, 1950 and to reorganize
the Provincial Government
by granting 17 out of the 23
seats in it to native Formo-
sans as a gesture of appease-
ment and by appointing an
American-educated scholar,
Dr. K. C. Wu, as governor so
as to solicit further US aid.
On December 15 the replace-


ment of Ch’en Ch’eng with
K. G. Wu was announced.
Meanwhile, many of the 30
scapegoats Wei Tao-ming
had ordered to be arrested
emerged to become actual
leaders of pros and cons. The
KMT partisan Chiang Wei-
ch’uan and the Democratic
Socialist Yen Ch’ing-hsien
petitioned for leniency and
became staunch supporters
of the refugee regime. Those
expatriated also appeared to
head the opposition: Hsieh
Hsueh-hung, Su Hsin, and
other ex-Communists joined
the CCP camp in China; the
Liao brothers, who were not
in Formosa during the inci-
dent, have been directing the
native patriots.
The idea of Formosan re-
emancipation originated dur-
ing Liao Wen-kwei’s return
in the autumn of 1946. But
it was the unfair settlement
of the February 28 Incident
that speeded up the organiza-
tion of the Formosan League
for Re-Emancipation ori-
ginaly aimed at local auto-
nomy through provincial
federation with the rest of
China—a United States of
China under a coalition go-
vernment as envisaged by a
growing number of liberal
Chinese leaders and thinkers.
With the CCP outlawed,
the Democratic League dis-
banded, liberal elements
suppressed, and KMT de-
spotism at its peak towards
the end of 1947, leading
members of the League gave
up their hope for any reali-
zation of democracy and
local automony. How should
the Formosans achieve re-
emancipation and salvation?
Some members of the League
favoured a UN trusteeship.
The two Liao brothers ob-
jected, because a permanent
foreign trusteeship would
mean colonial rule against
which the Formosans have
been fighting for three cen-
turies. A plebiscite would
offer the fairest way to de-
termine the future status of
the country.
Early in 1948, Liao Wen-
kwei was arrested on charges
of having been involved in
the February 28 Incident, of
being an advocate of foreign
trusteeship over Formosa,
and of association with
radical Chinese, by the
Shanghai-Woosung Garrison
Commander’s Headquarters.
He was bailed out after 100
days’ detention during which
he won a three-hour debate
with the Special Tribunal


Procurator and cleared him-
self of the charges.
The arrest of Liao Wen-
kwei drove many of his fol-
lowers out of Shanghai and
Formosa to rally round his
younger brother Liao Wen-
ih then in Hongkong. To
these Formosans, any further
appeal for Chinese sympathy
would be futile, and however
Chinese rule might improve
in Formosa, it would be no
alternative to independence.
The Formosans must liberate
themselves. Hence the Ap-
pearance of the triangular
struggle among the Formo-
sans everywhere.
Meanwhile, Liao Wen-ih
sent Peter Huang, Frank
Lim, Gordon Tan, and Y. T.
Tsong to Japan to spread in-
formation among Formosan
residents and also started
writing to governments of
the democratic countries to
sponsor a Formosan plebis-
cite. By the end of March,
1949, the United Nations had
actually received a communi-
cation from the Formosan
League for Re-Emancipation
in Hongkong and a petition
for a plebiscite to determine
whether the Formosan people
want independence. In Octo-
ber Liao Wen-ih flew to
Manila, where Dr. Bernabe
Africa also advocated the
holding of a plebiscite in
Formosa. Meanwhile, the
same League declared the
invalidity of the Cairo deci-
sion by enumerating the
reasons for its abrogation—
particularly by invoking the
power and priority of the
Atlantic Charter which pro-
vides for racial self-deter-
mination and free choice of
the form of government
under which a people want
to live. In December Y. T.
Tsong in "Tokyo submitted a
17-page memo to SCAB for
immediate occupation of For-
mosa during the period of
preparation for complete in-
dependence.
The Formosa Problem is
no longer a mere Sino-
Formosan issue. It has be-
come a world-problem. The
whole world has realized
not only Chinese misrule but
also Formosan discontent
with it and growing anxiety
to expel the KMT and repel
the CCP. But the CCP has
taken the land; the KMT has
kept the sea; and the Formo-
sans have caught only the air;
Such was the picture of the
triangular struggle at the be-
ginning of 1950.




II
ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION
OF FORMOSA 1
Opportunities for Graft
Lack of public spirit on the part of so many KMT execu-
tives was the basic cause of the speedy and spectacular collapse
of the Kuomintang Army and economy in postwar China. To
make easy money, most of the take-over officials, who had
impatiently suffered poverty and misery in the interior during
the war, now resorted to the practice of mercilessly “kill ng
chickens for eggs” instead of patiently “feeding sheep for
wool.” They boasted of the quantities of the taken-over raw
materials and finished products, trucks and boats, factories
and machinery. Yet, instead of utilizing them for public
interests and productive purposes they either grabbed or
wasted them. No earnest effort was accomplished for recon-
struction and rehabilitation. And, by forcing thee people to
convert their gold bars and foreign currencies into the Gold
Yuan half a year before they absconded from Nanking, the
Nationalists stripped many earnest citizens naked.
Besides, by their civic control and economic restriction
were created numerous new chances to grab. The susceptibili-
ty to such temptation has always been due to their system of
public service notorious for its underpayment, no present
stability, and no future security. Since old dogs can neither
learn new tricks nor change fixed habits, what was true in
China has been even more true in Formosa.
In the Island all the large industries which had been Jap-
anese-owned were taken over by provincial and/or central gov-
ernment agencies and, whenever private capital was invited,
henchmen and kinsmen of KMT officials had first crack. But
most of the damaged machinery would be torn and shipped

away as ‘‘scrap iron.” Thus, in no time there appeared all
varieties of bureaucratic capital.
Of the taken-over industries:
(1) Those operated by the National Resources Commis-
sion included:
(a) Petroleum refining.
(b) Aluminium.
(c) Copper mining.
(2) Those operated jointly by NRC and the Taiwan
Provincial Government included:
(a) Sugar.
(b) Electric power.
(c) Chemical fertilizer.
(b) Ship and machine building.
(e) Alkalies.
(f) Cement.
(g) Paper and pulp.
(3) Those operated by the Taiwan Provincial Govern-
ment included:
(a) Large coal mines.
(b) Iron and steel.
(c) Oils and fats.
(d) Textiles.
(e) Brick and tile.
(f) Electrical Manufactures.
(g) Chemical products (rubber, essences).
(h) Printing.
(i) Building construction.
(j) Supply of industrial equipment and materials.


Nepotism and Despotism
The immediate exemplification of egoism in public ad-
ministration is nepotism and factional bureaucracy. In
Formosa the take-over officials and occupation forces have
behaved exactly like swarms of locusts combing all greens.
To maintain the prestige of a privileged class, they would form
juntas everywhere to discriminate first against native person-
nel and next against any outer group members. Almost every
KMT official has had a gang of hangers-on, whom he would
before giving legalized jobs and pays house and feed in private
but with public funds. The day after the taking-over was
completed, he would announce his reconstruction scheme,
creating jobs not according to the quantities and qualities of
the works involved but according to the number of job-hunters
around him. To such an extent prevailed nepotism that not
only concubines and minors were often appointed to high-pay-
ing posts but sinecures were reserved for “ghost incumbents''
and “paper soldiers” scheduled to appear from China but
forever 'deterred from assuming office. Similarly, just as
many police-stations came to have Chinese heads under 20
years old bMt Formosan sergeants about 40, so has many a
factory had a 25-year-old superintendent from China who had
never attended any college but a 50-year-old Formosan deputy
director and chief engineer a graduate with honour from the
Technical College of an Imperial University in Japan.
In industry alone Formosa has been much too big for
China to run; for China has neither money nor talent. To
resume operation of all Formosan factories left by the
Japanese, China must mobilize all her well-trained technicians.
Formosa has turned out 7,000 proficient technicians as
many as China just as the number of her skilful physicians
equals that of China. Moreover, Formosa has even more
manufactories than China without Manchuria. Still native
Formosan doctors and engineers have been always and every-
where unfairly treated. As an immediate result, efficiency has
dropped sharply as compared with the previous level
except in a few industries like cement, electric power, alumin-


ium, etc., in which US capital and technology have pre-
dominated.
At the time of the retrocession many Szechuan sugar
experts were considered competent to take over and operate
Formosan mills, half of the 42 Japanese-owned remaining in
working conditions. Later, many Szechuan men weie
sent theree to study but hold directors’ posts and
pays. Because sugar mills after taken over often
broke their word to pay farmers in ready cash and to
supply them with fertilizer regularly, most farmers dis-
continued in 1946 the planting of sugar-cane. Therefore in
the year 1946-47 the output could hardly go beyond 30,000 tons
as contrasted with the maximum production of 1,400,000 tons
in 1940-41- The 500,000 tons confiscated from Japanese
capitalists and Formosan labourers was consumed for upkeep
expenses during the first two years follows V-J Day while not
an iota was used for any reconstruction work.
The Monopoly Bureau devised by the Japanese had been
intended to increase public revenues and thereby lessen the
people’s burden. In its addition the first Chinese Administra-
tor-General Ch’en Yi inaugurated the Trading Bureau osten-
sibly for the same purpose. If earnestly administered, they
would suffice to cover public expenditure. But in effect
they served only to facilitate the KMT officials graft and to
chastize private Formosan manufacturers and bus nessmen.
Every Formosan product able to yield a big profit abroad fell
a victim to the Trading Bureau, the main objects being rice,
coal, sugar, and lumber. Yet the regulations grew in number
and changed in nature so often that equivocal explanations
could be made at any time to suit the greedy incumbents’
expediencies.
The Monopoly Bureau in its restrictive function is nearly
a duplicate of the Custom House. But it dare not challenge
the latter’s authorities, but, instead, banned from the
Formosan coast all competitors, foreign oi Chinese made
cigarettes in particular. Thus, instead of urging the custom-
officers to censure “inter-provincial smugglers” the Bureau


would dispatch armed men to snatch away all packages from
Formosan children-peddlers whose poor parents entrusted
them with a small sum of money as capital.
Wealth Overestimated
True, the high percentage of literacy, the habitual industry
and frugality, and the vigour inherited and training received
make the 6,000,000 Formosans equivalent in man-power to
18,000,000 Chinese. Moreover, the industrial equipment and
establishments left by the Japanese, the technical skill and
working efficiency acquired by the Formosans, and ,-the
resources and productivities that surpass those of every
Chinese province in the mountain, on the plain, or
from the sea warrant the multiplication of 18,000,000
by another 3 that equals 54,000,000 - a population
larger than that of Szechuan. So much so that
while underestimating the cultural level of the people, the
KMT officials and soldiers have overestimated the pecuniary
potentiality of the country. To them Formosa is a treasure
as well as a beautiful island. They knew that all big indus-
tries were either government monopolies or Japanese-owned
and, full of cash a-nd goods, would be outright confiscated. They
also learned that of the over 800,000 Formosan acres of arable
land 66.8% belonged to the government and 18% to private
Japanese and after confiscated would yield almost 85% of the
total agricultural output. They were also assured that all the
forests, salt-fields, and most of the mines were government-
owned and/or-controlled. Above all, they presumed that the
native inhabitants as had been for half a century whipped into
docile submission by the high-handed Japanese policies would
remain slavish farmers and tractable workers ever-ready to
perform every toil but expect no spoil.
Alas! upon their arrival the take-over officials found the
Formosans far from docile and slavish. Critical of Chinese
incompetency and arrogance, the natives refused to cooperate;
disgusted with their ignorance and inefficiency, workers re-
fused to obey. Lack of fertilizer, farms and fields produced


less than half of the previous capacity. To open forests,
operate mines, and keep up salt-fields, that needed circulating
capital and earnest men. Neither could the take-over person-
nel supply properly. As to the factories, a number of them
had been damaged, for which they continued blaming US
bombers. Even to resume operation of the good ones the
Chinese regime had neither money nor spare parts nor talent
particularly because native engineers and mechanics were
ostracized simply on account of their Formosan birth.
With their previous fantacies frustrated, they became
desperate. Realizing their own inability to reconstruct the
Formosan industries and transfer the linkage of the Formosan
economic and industrial systems from Tokyo to Nanking, they
would grab while the grabbing was good. As the taking-over
process in Manchuria and North China reached an irrevocable
deadlock, the more sensibly the KMT officialdom foresaw their
inability to retake Communist-occupied areas, the more urgency
they felt to double their efforts to turn Formosa into the only
trophy from their eight years’ war of resistance whereby to
mend with Formosan resources every war-scar they had
suffered even though the country had to be razed to the ground
and the people had to be stripped to the skin.
Inefficiency and Restriction
With waste and graft, nepotism and despotism prevailing
simultaneously, there appeared under Ch’en Yi 759 incumbents
by selective appointment against 87 under the Japanese and
8,168 by recommendatory appointment against 862 prior to the
taking-over. Of the Japanese budget 30% had been assigned
for salaries and office-upkeeps and 70% for public enterprises;
whereas under Ch’en Yi 76.63% was reserved for salaries only
but merely 23.37% for public enterprises. As to the sources
of revenue, under the Japanese 15% came from taxes, 55% from
monopolies, and 30% from public enterprises such as railways,
posts, telegraphs, and forests; but under Ch’en Yi 34.73%
was derived from taxes, 16.58% from monopolies, and 38.94%
from 70% of all government-owned and-operated industries
besides railways, posts, telegraphs, and forests.


Almost in every respect the Formosan people have had to
bear a much heavier burden; the governmnt has wasted a much
larger sum of money; while the country has been becoming
poorer and poorer day after day than before. Thus, despite
the operations of the Trading and the Monopoly Bureaux the
Formosan tax-payers under Ch’en Yi had to bear 34.73% of the
annual budget as contrasted with 15% under the Japanese who
had run no Trading Bureau at all. Similarly, though 60% of the
confiscated sugar went to the Central Government in Nanking;
though 40% of the income was supposed to return to the Island
in the form of either fertilizer or beaji cakes or cotton goods;
and though half of the monthly production of 80,000 tons of
coal in 1946 was purchased at 1/10 of the Shanghai market
price and shipped away for sale; yet nothing ever returned to
help reconstruct the country and rehabilitate the people.
On September 26, 1946 the formation of four companies
under the Monopoly Bureau was ordered for the handling and
production of four monopoly articles, namely, wine, matches,
camphor, and cigarettes. On January 6, 1947 they were duly
established. On December 12, 1946 the Bureau approved the
formation of an overall provincial industrial and mining deve-
lopment corporation with the capital of TY165,000,000, which
was intended-to be the chief administrative and policy-making
organ for the 107 companies, factories, and plants taken over
from the Japanese. In effect this became the regimenting
centre of all activities of economic exploitation. Next day,
the Taiwan Salt Administration Office announced that a total
of 131,000 tons of salt had been shipped to Japan from
Formosa in 1946 in accordance with the arrangements made
between the KMT regime and SCAB and that the quota for
1947 was to be 300,000 tons.
On February 13, 1947 the Office of the Administrator-
General formally banned as from that day all private trans-
actions of gold and foreign currency except by the Bank of
Taiwan. At the same time it set the ceiling price for rice at
Y 23.90 a catty for the Taipeh City. On February 15 were
promulgated regulations for the stabilization of prices in


Taiwan that reached down the smallest shops and side-walk
stalls. Besides, the Island was divided into five districts for
taking rigid action against rice-hoarding and illicit merchants.
On February 19 the Government announced that those found
hoarding rice exceeding 5,000 piculs should be sentenced to
death with all the rice confiscated. All new economic regula-
tions as such, if thoroughly enforced, would have abolished
private trades virtually.
By that time the Formosans had reached the breaking
point of patience. But the fuse of the island-wide revolt
against KMT tyranny and robbery was lit not by a Formosan
but by a Chinese—an anti-smuggling officer of the Monopoly
Bureau, who on seizing the cigarette tray of an old Formosan
woman selling imported cigarettes shot to death a Formosan
civilian on the evening of February 27, 1947.
Worsening Exploitation and Growing Inflation
Under the next Governor Wei Tao-ming KMT exploitation
of Formosa turned from bad to worse. Exactly one month
after he assumed office the Provincial Council was coerced to
pass the Government bill to purchase rice at 18 Yen a catty
against 50 in the free market. At once it was decreed that
landowners of more than 2.5 Formosan acres must sell their
surplus rice to the Government at the official price. Thereby
was the KMT regime enabled to ship from the summer of 1947
to that of 1948 at least 440,000 tons of rice to China.
To cover all signs of degradation and deterioration, the
new Governor kept mentioning the enemy property as recorded
in the 100,000-word inventory and chronically raising the
exchange-rate of the Formosan Yen against the Chinese Dollar.
To be sure, as early as January, 1946 the take-over officials
estimated the total value of the enemy property to be
Y 15,665,351,808.37. When the taking-over was completed in
April, 1947 just before Ch’en Yi’s departure Finance Commis-
sioner Yen Chia-kan of the Japanese Property Disposal Com-
mittee still reported the same figure despite the 1,000% infla-
tion of the Taiwan Yen during the preceding 16 months.


As to inflation, the sole productive industry the Chinese
introduced into Formosa, the Bank of Taiwan had issued notes
amounting to Y 1,500,026,715 in August, 1945; Y 2,027,904,765
in September, 1945; and Y 2,661,889,789 in October, 1945, when
it was taken over by the Chinese under Ch’en Yi. In November,
1945 the total issue was Y 2,813,010, 024. One year later, Yen
Chia-kan promised to circulate no more than Y 6,000,000,000
when the value of Yen had fallen from Yls for one US Dollar
at the Japanese surrender to Yl5O.
One more year later (by the end of 1947) the Taiwan
Banknotes amounted to about Y 15,000,000,000; so that USsl
soared bdyond Y 1,500. By the end of 1948 this figure had
risen to more than Y 180,000,000,000 and USsl had risen above
Y 30,000. On August 19, 1948 when the Chinese National Cur-
rency was converted into the Gold Yuan, GYI was set at
TY1,835. As the inflation of GY started accelerating two
months thereafter, the ratio became smaller and smaller till
TY surpassed GY half a year later. Yet the inflation of TY
continued though at a lower speed.
The arrival of government units from China after the fail
of Tsinan increased the pressure as more notes were called for
to pay increased government personnel and meet other ex-
penses in the Island. To the KMT regime in Formosa as well
as in China note-printing has been much easier and quicker
than rice-production. Besides, wealthy refugees instead of
investing their money in productive industries had begun to
speculate with gold bars and US notes; so that commodity
prices would fluctuate from minute to minute and the key-
money for rooms or houses which Chinese brokers would
charge later arrivals often exceeded the original price by
several times.
Working as the regimenting center of all bureaucratic
capitals and concurrently the pecuniary arsenal of war-victors
and peace-profiteers, the Bank of Taiwan thereafter had to
facilitate new Carpet-Baggers and Scalawags against native
rights and interests with the note-printing machine. At the


end of 1947 it had let out loans amounting to Y 29,000,000,000
of which 25% had been allotted to government institutions,
67% to public enterprises and the rest to private individuals
and firms. Only 0.2% had been made to Formosan individuals
and corporations. The rate of interest being exceedingly low, all
government establishments and KMT customers could easily
make money by taking the margin between it and the rate of
inflation; whereas most of the Formosans, unable to contract
any Taiwan Bank loan, had to pay high interests, suffer unfair
competition, and eventually incur depression and unemploy-
ment.
What GY was to CNC, that was the Chinese TY to the
Japanese TY. Just as GY had to be replaced by the Silver
Yuan, so was the Old Chinese TY supplanted by the New
Chinese TY. After VJ Day the Taiwan Yen ought to have re-
mained stronger than the Japanese Yen of Japan Proper. For
Formosa had suffered less destruction during the war than
Japan and had had no reparation to pay. Yet, by the spring of
1949, whereas the official exchange-rate of the Japanese Yen
was still 360 to one US Dollar, the Old Chinese TY slumped to
200.000 for one US Dollar—sso times as low as the Japanese
Yen. Why? Because the Chinese take-over officials had since
four years before been living off the country, milking the people
for their savings, grabbing and wasting the industrial equip-
ment and resources, and kept printing banknotes. Ostensibly
they kept raising the exchange-rate of TY against CNC, then
against GY, and finally against SY, only to deceive such
careless observers as unaware of the varied tempo
of inflation.
On June 15, 1949 Wei Tao-ming’s successor, General Ch’en
Ch’eng enforced the currency reform by pegging the Old TY at
200.000 for one US Dollar and the New TY at 5 for USsl. The
immediate market Reaction was the abruptly sharp rise in com-
modity-prices again. By raiding so many underground banks
the secret service men gained 20% or more of the confiscated
funds, gold bars, and foreign currencies; the government kept
the rest; but thousands of native Formosans, who had hitherto


had to concede every priority to Chinese customers either in
making loans or in keeping deposits in authorized banks, were
driven into destituton. Though over three hundred million
worth of US currency had been shipped into the Island by the
Central Government for safekeeping, yet the prevailing cur-
rency was not a bit strengthened.
Novel Ways of Extortion
Just as currency-reform so has rent-reduction been
utilized as channel for extortion. From the first harvest of
1949 the hitherto average 50% rent was reduced by govern-
mental order to 37.5%. It has been the established agreement
between landlords and tenants in Formosa, however, that in
case of famine and drought, flood and typhoon, both parties
would confer and decide to divide the crop on the 50-50 basis
right on the field. In the years of abundance the tenants
often get more than 62.5% while the landlords, less than 37.5%.
Therefore, in many cases Ch’en Ch’eng’s rent-reduction
means rent-increase. Worst of all, the government claims all
surplus grain at the official price with the immediate result
that the poor tenants have lost more than gained and that
Formosa has thus been placed under the obligation to feed the
whole KMT China.
Another racket whereby the KMT regime robbed farmers
of their rice was accomplished through the manipulation of
the exchange-rate of rice and fertilizer. Throughout 1949,
though the international market-price of fertilizer per ton was
US$7O and that of rice US$l7O and one ton of rice ought to
exchange for 2.43 tons of fertilizer, yet the KMT Government
reversed the exchange-ratio to between 1.8 and 1.5 tons of rice
for one ton of fertilizer, thus lowering the rice-price to US$4O
or so—less than 25% of the market price—or boosting the
fertilizer-price to almost US$3O0 —more than 400% of the
market price. In 1949 the KMT Government received 60,000
tons of fertilizer from EGA and purchased 60,000 tons from
other sources and exchanged the total 120,000 tons of fertilizer
for at least 180,000 tons of rice. The total rice-output of


Formosa in 1949 being- 1,200,000 tons, with rents reduced to
87.5% as alleg-edly from the former 50% of each crop the
tenants should have gained 1,200,000 x (50% —87.5%) =
150,000 tons —an amount even less than what the KMT re-
gime got merely by exchanging the 120,000 tons of fertilizer
for! In view of such enormous profits the Chinese authori-
ties in Formosa have allowed no private firm or individual to
import fertilizer directly from abroad. Thus, in effect EGA
fertilizer in 1949 only helped refugee tyrants extort more rice
from earnest Formosan farmers.
Similarly, though rents were reduced, taxes which the
landlords have had to pay were often increased with the im-
mediate result that many landlords, by getting smaller rencs
but paying higher taxes, have been driven to the verge of bank-
ruptcy. Likewise, some land-owners who till their own fields
often grow barely enough rice for their own consumption in-
stead of seeing so much grain carried off practically free of
charge.
Just as in China so in Formosa the decline and fall of the
KMT Army and economy has been ascribed by its leaders to
the shortage of US aid. Nevertheless, unless graft and waste,
nepotism and despotism, technical incompetence and native
antagonism be eliminated beforehand, no foreign aid can fill
up the rathole. By the removal of the KMT Capital to the
Island early last December was Formosa disguised as “China”
and obliged to support KMT China. On December 21 Ch’en
Ch’eng was replaced by K. C. Wu, whose fiscal budget of
TY178,913,556 for 1950 was perforce pushed through the Pro-
vincial Council on December 24. On the previous day Ambas-
sador Wellington Koo formally solicited further US assistance
for Formosa, including military, political, and economic ad-
visers. After all only EGA decided to carry on a bit longer.
Whereas in CCP China one soldier is supported by one
hundred people, in KMT Formosa ten civilians, including
young and old, men and women, have to feed one uniform
man. The money Formosa has won to pay for the upkeep


of the Legislative and the Control Yuan alone has been
about USS3OO,OOO per month. Besides, 59% of the military
expenditure has to be borne by the Island. Since Taipeh was
made capital, all new Formosan money bills for military pur-
poses have been appropriated by the Bank of Taiwan. The
New TY issue was then allegedly limited to 200,000,000. Up
until January 31 the amount issued had reached 177,923,782.50,
leaving a little margin for further issuance. Whether the
Bank of Taiwan has actually kept a gold reserve of 637,442,-
081.00 oz. as alleged by itself, nobody can be sure.
New Rackets
As the Lunar New Year approached in February, 1950, in
the black market one US Dollar exchanged for TYlo—twice
as high as the official rate. To prevent further inflation, in-
crease production, and curtail consumption on the one hand,
and to provide administrative and military expenditure on the
other, K. C. Wu started trying to make ends meet by:
(1) Depositing military appropriations in the Bank of
Taiwan in order to avoid the possibility of the money going
into the black market and by transferring the deposits of all
public utilities and government institutions from all other
banks to the Bank of Taiwan.
(2) Paying soldiers regularly and actually after elimina-
ting any “paper troops” to be paid.
(3) Assisting private industries and legitimate business
and curbing smuggling.
(4) Soaking the rich by the compuslory sale of Liberty
bonds and charging high contributions for Chinese wanting to
leave Formosa.
(5) Selling government property, such as houses and
land to private individuals.
(6) Encouraging production by improving irrigation and
increasing power supplies.
(7) Sweeping upward revision of taxes.


In purpose intended for augumenting government re-
venue, these measures have been in effect enriching in-
cumbents’ pockets and diminishing civilians’ sources of income
—those of the Formosans in particular—and created more
losses than gains in national economy as a whole.
In the first place, because the Bank of Taiwan has. mono-
polized all big transactions, all other banks having branches
throughout the local districts have been deprived of most of
their best customers, namely, public utilities and government
institutions. Moreover, because the Bank of Taiwan main-
tains branches only in big cities, public utilities and govern-
ment institutions in small places have to waste time and money
in contacting the Bank of Taiwan offices.
. Secondly, unless superior officers have become honest
enough to eliminate paper subordinates, no civil inspector—
not even the governor himself —dare to check the rank and file.
Even power inspectors dare not read meters inside any mili-
tary establishment anywhere throughout China for fear of
face-slapping. How much less dare any government clerk
search after “paper troops”?
Thirdly, on assisting private industries and legitimate
business men, those aided are mostly refugee-speculators and
bureaucratic capitalists rather than native enterprisers. The
g|reat smugglers in KMT China having been well-known to be
navy-and custom-officers themselves, who can censure and
eliminate them?
Fourthly, who are the rich to be soaked through bond-
sale? Mostly, house-owners and landlords, whose concrete
evidence of wealth is visible, and whose great majority are
native Formosans. How about those Chinese refugee million-
aires with gold bars and foreign currencies shipped
from China? Among those wanting to leave Formosa,
most Chinese can manage to secure some official title so as to
evade every sur-charge and bond-purchase, which not many
Formosans can do.
Fifthly, by the sale of government property to private in-
dividuals there have been created more opportunities for graft


and embezzlement than any other channel. Any highest bid-
der in the open, unless he oils the backdoor of the
auction-room, can never be sure of getting the commodity
wanted. Contrary to this, Li Chien-hsing, who has been a
close friend of every governor, recently bought a coal mine for
New TY350,000, which in the free market was worth at least
TY5,000,000!
Sixthly, encouraging production is meaningless if surplus
output is taken away from producers practically free of
charge. Likewise, if the officials In charge have to be oiled
with buckets, the planned improvement of irrigation and
increase in power supplies help neither the government nor
the people. “No oil, no water; no bribe, no power,” have many
civilians complained.
Seventhly and finally, whether taxes are increased or re-
duced, special charges, emergency-donations, compulsory con-
tributions, and the like, that have made their appearance one
after another, have overburdened the people more than proper
taxes.
Prospects , not Bright
•
After all, every measure has been more easily said than
done. First of all, taxes too heavy for many people to bear
cannot be duly collected. According to the present Finance
Commissioner Jen Hsien-ch’un, from the Taipeh area alone the
taxes not yet collected for the year 1949 amounted to New
TY11,000,000. (Surnamed Liu, father and son, allegedly be-
cause they had refrained from paying land-taxes equivalent to
over 100,000 catties of polished rice, were recently sentenced to
3 and 4 years’ imprisonment respectively.)
On May 12,1950 Premier Ch’en Ch’eng reported before the
Legislative Yuan that the annual expenditure of 1950 would
exceed 300,000,000 silver dollars. Of this sum 85% would be
spent for military purposes. The local government by collect-
ing taxes, selling bonds and public property, and other ways
would take up 144,000,000; the Central Government hoped to


get 60,000,000 out of customs and salt-taxes. As to the re-
maining 100,000,000, 3,500,000 oz. of gold from the National
Treasury would be sold to maintain the balance of revenue
and expenditure. As a matter of fact, because unable to
collect enough salt-taxes, the KMT regime has been buying salt
from manufacturers at TY3O a picul and selling at TY6SO!
Still harder has it been to maintain the balance of foreign
trade. According to the official estimate, the annual exports
of products of national enterprises would amount to US$66,-
000,000; while the imports would amount to USSIOO,OOO,OOO.
Among the imported commodities Ub514,000,000 would be
spent for munitions. Then there would appear an import-
excess of U 5520,000,000. The import-excess of 1949 amounted
to U 5519,000,000. The new aid of U 5540,000,000 would help
maintain the balance this year. Yet Governor K. C. Wu said
in May, 1950 before foreign correspondents that Formosa
every month would need a military and economic aid of
USSIO,OOO,OOO but had received during the first four months
of this year only U 5512,000,000. The new aid of U5540,000,-
000 recently decided for the period from July 1, 1950 to June
30, 1951, if not followed by any more, would become a drop in
the ocean.
As the KMT authorities decided on June 14 to issue New
TY20,000,000 more, US notes had another jump—l to 15,
exactly the rate of August 15, 1945. On July 7 the government
admitted the over-issue of 50,000,000 Yen. In view of the in-
creasing financial pressure it is pertinent to envisage the re-
currence of monetary inflation and economic despondence.'
Without further US aid and earnest native cooperation,
how much longer will the KMT economy hold out in Foimosa.
Before its total collapse, however, the status of Formosa might
be decided by the UN General Assembly or the Japanese Peace
Conference and change overnight. The New Deal will at once
be followed by inauguration of new systems of public service,
political economy, and productive industry. For the KMT the
prospects are not bright but for Formosa not dark forever.


III
WHITHER FORMOSA? 1
HOPES AGAINST HOPE
The KMT Comeback
On March 1, 1950 Chiang Kai-shek emerged from retire-
ment to resume his presidency of the Republic of China
cornered in Formosa. Evidently he believed in his ability to
recover the lost territory once again as he did in 1945 on the
ground that Washington would after all never let Formosa
and China down; that World War 111 would certainly break
out in his lifetime; and that US boats and planes would once
more bring KMT “victors and conquerors across the Formosa
Strait though in the opposite direction. Man thinking ac-
cording to his knowledge or his motive, in the summer of 1949 a
Chinese refugee Taoist priest in the streets of Taipeh prophesi-
ed the outbreak of the next world war in six months’ time.
Another Chinese, a highly educated Youth Party Member, as-
serted in December, 1949 before the present author a 90% pro-
bability of the outbreak of the next world war within 1950; for
the Democracies after 1950 would become hardly able to defeat
the Communists, he argued.
On March 9, the newly-appointed Premier Ch’en Ch’eng in
order to win the majority’s support from the home-sick Legis-
lative Yuan Members stranded in Formosa pledged to launch
a counter-offensive on the Mainland within two months. If
in him Chiang Kai-shek and his KMT adherents find the last
trump-card left to play, it was tactless for him to venture any
precarious move as he had once attempted in vain to retake
Manchuria. Nor should he have committed himself to such a
promise and divulged such a top military secret. Even though
the anti-Communist world war might occur in Chiang Kai-
shek’s lifetime, it remains disputable as to whether the Formo-
1, In substance published in the Far Eastern Economic Review, Sept. 14, 1950,


san conscripts will fight for the KMT, whether the Chinese
will greet him back again as a national hero as in 1945, and
whether the Democratic Allies will accept his comradeship.
Curiously enough, ten days before May 9—two full months
from March 9 Hainan was lost to the CCP and ten days
thereafter the Chushan Archipelago was evacuated by the
KMT troops.
The probability of Chiang Kai-shek’s comeback is thus too
slim to deserve any penetrating scrutiny, history not often re-
peating itself.
The CCP Invasion
It is entirely by many other competing political forces that
the possibility of the KMT comeback is vastly discounted. First
of all, comes the CCP invasion of Formosa, the last stronghold
of Chiang Kai-shek’s KMT. In case of any successful CCP
invasion, the KMT will go to ruin with its top-leaders forced
'out through the air. Just as the rank and file have lost their
stomachs for fighting, so have those leaders kept no iota of
their early revolutionary spirit. Old in mind they now crave
ease and comfort. Once exiled abroad, they will go “White
Chinese” dreaming back of their heyday. How can they agitate
for any more revolution or organize any forlorn hope? For
reviving such a hazardous life they find no able successors,
either. Thus are KMT remnants bound to disappear like
morning dews in the hot sun.
Most of the promising leaders of future China have either
gone northward to join the CCP or turned away from KMT
Formosa forever. The worsening weakness of the KMT as such
adds to the growing strength of the CCP. However, though the
CCP High Command has been preparing for the military in-
vasion of Formosa, yet it will take years to build
up sufficient fleets of transports and warships and
still more years to train sufficient numbers of sailors
and marines, fliers and parachutists. Thereafter they
will have to be sure not only of effecting a success-
ful landing but also of bringing every opponent to his knees,


failing which it will take still many more years to repeat the
same adventure. Financially speaking, even the first compul-
sory bond-sale can not possibly defray the cost of the invasion.
Now that the United States Government has decided to
neutralize Formosa from the KMT-CCP duel, it is very likely
that the war situation across the Formosa Strait will for
years remain a deadlock like the stagnation between Germany
and Great Britain pending the active participation of their
respective foreign allies. Yet each has been doing its utmost
to bluff the other into silence: The CCP has been broadcasting
their determination to liberate Formosa in 1950, which they
call the year of complete national liberation; the KMT War
Cabinet has been advertizing its ability to launch a counter-
offensive at the quickest moment. None the less time seems
to work against the KMT unless the cold war change into a hot
one between the Red and the White camps. For the CCP fight-
ing forces are improving but the KMT troops are aging while
the Formosan conscripts may “go slow” at any moment.
Meanwhile, dissension within either party as well as new
complications in international politics may burst to the disad-
vantage of one or the other. Nevertheless, before the Chinese
Reds build enough navy and air forces the KMT blockade and
bombing have annoyed tho industries, communications, and
foreign trades of Red China. Formosa or no Formosa makes
little difference to them now. But blockade and bombing with
Formosa as the radiating centre and retention of the diploma-
tic seat in the United Nations have turned the beautiful island
in East China Sea into the appendicitis of the Celestial Empire.
Hence the growing seriousness of the Formosan menace, to
which the CCP has been ascribing every misery of liberated
China.
The sudden discontinuation of KMT military operations
against China by Washington means a warning against any
CCP attempt to invade Formosa. To the Reds the only way
to liberate the Island is now to support both their own fifth
columnists and the Formosan leftists in converting native
inhabitants and changing the flag by overthrowing the KMT


regime through sabotage or rebellion, thus achieving conquest
without bloodshed. Yet, unless such elements be competent
for such difficult tasks and unless they be ready for a hot war
against the democratic camp, any spectacular success as such
is not within sight. Though the Formosans hate the KMT, yet
they fear the CCP. For re-emancipation from Chinese bond-
age, they look to their native patriots who have been on their
behalf demanding a plebiscite to determine the future status of
their country. Thus like the KMT comeback the CCP invasion
is not highly probable, only hoping against hope.
The New Party Absorption
Whereas the Formosan patriots have since the unfair set-
tlement of the February 28 Incident occupied one corner of the
triangular struggle, the idea of organizing a new political party
among the Chinese to replace the Nationalists and resist the
Communists appeared only after Hsuchow fell and the KMT
regime began to crack. But it did not become an open move-
ment till after the publication of the White Paper that ex-
presses its hope for the birth and growth of liberal forces in
China. The encouragement, however, at once turned into an
inducement to Chinese opportunists and mercenaries, who
always outnumber patriots and mercenaries. Thus, accord-
ing as the gap of feeling between Chiang Kai-shek and Li
Tsung-jen grew, Hu Shih, T. F. Tsiang, Lai Lien, etc. in
America representing Chiang’s supporters began to talk about
organizing the Chinese Liberal Party; while in the Canton and
Hongkong region Li’s adherents headed by Legislative Yuan
President Tung Kwan-hsien speeded up their organization of
the Democratic Progressive Party. To the new movement
there have been attracted a number of Youth Party demagogues
and Democratic Socialists led by Wu Hsien-tzu. Among all
the anti-KMT political groups exiled in Hongkong, only this
branch of the Democratic Socialists and the Formosan patriots
have refrained from going north to join the Reds.
With Chiang’s diehards entrenched in Formosa tremend-
ous difficulties are facing the Formosan patriots to expel


the KMT at present. Nor will it be an easy task for them to
repel the CCP in the future however enthusiastic they may be.
None the less the shrewd Chinese political engineers never fail
to take notice of their activities and aspirations. Nor can they
ignore the value and need of absorbing them into their camp so
as to keep Formosa attached to the China of their dream and
inspire half-a-million Formosan youths to lead the van in their
comeback campaign. Thus, unlike the arrogant KMT and the
insolent CCP the new partisans adopt a soft, persuasive at-
titude towards the islanders. When an attempt to amalgamate
the two new parties appeared, emissaries approached leaders
of the Formosan League for Re-Emancipation in Tokyo and
Hongkong, outright promising autonomy of the highest pos-
sible degree. In response the Formosans demanded the
organization of a provisional government of the Formosan
Free State pending the Japanese Peace Conference and the
holding of a plebiscite thereafter which they never give up in
their parleys with agents from any Chinese party, old or new.
Meanwhile, by Chiang’s resumption of the presidency Act-
ing President Li before returning from recuperation in America
was deposed, till their hidden friction became an open contest
and liberals of Chiang’s faction drifted apart from Li’s follow-
ing. As the traditional conflict in the North between “native-
born” and “foreignized” Reds is also growing steadily, Li is
now projecting his hope to rally all liberal, nationalistic
elements from CCP China. But to organize a new party com-
petent for such a gigantic task is not easy at all.
Immediately after the neutralization of Formosa from the
KMT-CCP duel by President Truman’s new policy announce-
ment on June 27, 1950 the KMT turned desperate. Like a
drowning man catching a straw its agents began suddenly to
question the jailed Formosan patriots and feel out their exiled
leaders with a view to placing Formosa under a native leader
acceptable to all sides concerned. From now on until and
unless a hot war break out, their armed units will be bottled
inside Formosa and remain “frozen” toward China. They
have come to know their days are numbered; for without


further US aid and earnest native support their economy will
soon collapse and be followed by their administrative deteriora-
tion. Should they soak and oppress the resentful Formosans too
much, they might provoke another rebellion. In the meantime,
they hope to suffer neither revenge nor persecution. So they
have offered to compromise. Yet they still want to retain
Chiang Kai-shek’s presidency and KMT overlordship as ground
for paving the route to their comeback campaign, which no
Formosan Free State will tolerate under its jurisdiction.
Foreign Occupation
In case either SCAP or any UN Commission occupy For-
mosa, the exiled KMT regime will have to quit, too. Back of
the Allies’ occupation there is ample reason as well as military
strength. In the first place, the Cairo decision being not final,
the legal status of Formosa remains undecided pending the
peace conference and therefore neutral, wherefore Formosa is
entitled to be saved and neutralized from the Chinese civil war
by the Allies. Secondly, the Cairo decision having become
impracticable since the Russian occupation of Manchuria,,
which the Japanese had actually stolen from KMT China, the
United States and Great Britain, co-signatories to it, have the
right to include Formosa into a security zone by removing the
KMT officialdom from it. Thirdly, the Cairo decision to hand
Formosa to China having been invalidated by the KMT
inability to hold out against Red expansion, the Allied Forces
have the right to hold Formosa—still an international soil—
against any hostile expansionists from outside.
On the contrary, military occupation of the Island by either
SCAP or UN might arouse undesirable emotional reactions.
First of all, the Formosans want no colonial system replacing
another nor any territorial change against their wishes unless
the occupation and trusteeship lead to complete independence.
Likewise, the KMT officialdom, unless granted the residential
right, will resent foreign interference. Moreover, the CCP and
its foreign allies will find the more propaganda material for
•anti-Democratic agitation.


By and large it is the Chinese refugees stranded in For-
mosa and lower-ranking KMT supporters who have been pray-
ing for foreign occupation and a UN mandate more than any-
one else. For they anticipate both CCP persecution and For-
mosan revenge. When under neutral authorities they can hope
for the same justice, which, ironically enough, they have been
denying the native inhabitants. Enjoying foreign protection,
they will bide their time and plot comeback measures as they
used to do in foreign concessions in the treaty ports and are
now doing in Hongkong and Macao. For the present security
and future prosperity they do not mind exchanging the ad-
ministrative for the residential right.
For holding Formosa against the CCP native leadership
counts more than refugee tyranny. The Allies will then have
to replace KMT overlords with native patriots, which is pre-
vention; to aid Free Formosa after the outbreak of World War
111 is cure, whose success is not sure. As the Allies’ policy
toward Formosa owing to its wrong start and unjust decision
at Cairo has been slow and cautious like that after the Italian
conquest of Ethiopia and German dismemberment of Czecho-
slovakia, though within few hours their troops can comoleti
military occupation of the Island, yet their action, strongest
of all political forces as it is, still remains one of so many.
Native Rebellion
Against KMT tyranny and robbery are the native For-
mosans ever-anxious to rebel. During the February 28 Incident
their rising was provoked and therefore ended in a failure.
The folly never will recur: Unless sure of success, they deem it
unwise to provoke any hot war. In case they succeed, the
KMT will be blown to pieces like Emperor Maximilian over-
thrown by the Mexicans with the immediate result that
Formosa will regain its independence lost in 1683 and 1890
at most through the formality of holding a plebiscite under
neutral observation. Owing to the lack of financial and
military strength, a successful rebellion is not within sight,
either.


All in all, Formosan revolutionaries began unarmed and
practically penniless, which has astonished sympathizers but
has been ridiculed by both mercenaries and adversaries. While
with neither arms nor alms, they are true to their conscience
and sure of popular support. That is why they possess boiling
hearts and itching palms and can maintain their spirits of
enthusiasm burning with patriotic zeal and surging through
their bodies and souls. As among other down-trodden peoples
so among the Formosans in the beginning stage patriots
sprouted like weeds, leaders budded like mushrooms, and
groups grew like tea-groves. There was no thorough re-
gimentation, no concentrated leadership, and no highly unified
organization, although, to start with, the Formosan people, far
letter trained and regimented than any nation on the Asiatic
Continent, are united in the will to freedom.
Besides conscience and popular support from within, time
and world opinion, too, add to their strength. Practically
all foreign sympathies are for the underdogs—particularly for
those who dare to stand up for their right and offer stubborn
resistance like the Filipinos repeating losing battles with the
Spaniards, the Americans, and the Japanese. Should the
Formosans succeed in creating an accomplished fact of self-
liberation, then even the United Nations would immediately let
the people determine their own destiny.
As to time, all Formosan patriots in age begin exactly
where the KMT tyrants in Formosa end; for the oldest Formo-
san revolutionary leader is younger than the youngest KM T
overlord. As the contest drags on, the junior team growing
in intelligence and experience and improving in regimentation,
organization, and leadership will eventually triumph over the
old men falling out or dying off one after another. Of the
rising generations among the Formosans, the conscripts will
master new weapons; the fugitives will import new ideas.
When the zero hour strikes, will they fight the CCP for the
KMT or the KMT for Ilha Formosa? Hence the ever-haunting
horns of the KMT dilemma between native cooperation and
rebellion.


Natural Selection and Social Elimination
The basic cause of the speedy and spectacular collapse of
the KMT Army and economy in China has been the lack of
public spirit on the part of so many public administrators it
has turned out. Self-seeking by nature, they have been form-
ing juntas for augmenting private interests at the sacrifice
of public welfare. Weak and coward, they are afraid of op-
ponents and critics; incompetent but still arrogant, they are
jealous of talent and worthies. So much so that since they
gained the reins of government with arms in 1928 they have
absorbed little fresh blood. On the present list of their top-
ranking political and military leaders, for instance, the great
majority already played their best roles two or more decades
ago, have been declinnig since, and cannot keep up with time
and tide. The rank and file, having efficiently fought the
Northern Warlords between 1926 and 1928, were no longer good
against the Japanese, much less against the Communists. The
political workers they trained during wartime have been good
only for havoc and commotion but not for reconstruction and
rehabilitation. The Allies, who saved them from the Japanese
conquest, will similarly help them against their Communist
rivals, they are hoping. The whole party is now one of de-
crepit men and infirm crooks.
Just because they ignored the principle of natural selec-
tion and the function of political metabolism, they refused to
eliminate invalids and undesirables from their active list, till
the whole group still including no doubt a number of healthy
elements was wiped out from China. Though they in-
augurated the so-called KMT Reformist Committee on August
5, 1950, including a Formosan Lien Chen-tung among its 20
top members, yet both physically and mentally every reformist
is a weak, mediocre character craving nothing but ease and
comfort!
Now sheltered in Formosa, the more they awake to the
value and need of selection and metabolism, the more vacancies
and concessions they have to offer the Formosans. Especially
with sources of man-power cut off, they have to replace their


own invalids with healthy natives, till the tail will wag the
dog: Wherever there is one less Chinese, there comes in one
more Formosan. If 35,000 natives be conscripted and armed
annually according to their plan, in a few years’ time the
balance of power will be tipped in favour or the Formosans.
Glancing over the past five years’ records, we find no
Formosan among the top-ranking incumbents under Ch’en Yi;
7 out of 15 under Wei Tao-ming and Ch’en Ch’eng; and 17 out
of 23 under K. C. Wu plus one Cabinet Minister though without
Portfolio, Ts’ai P’ei-huo, whose rank and right the KMT has
meant for justifying the duty of every ten Formosans to feed
one Chinese soldier. And, in the recent losing battle with
Governor K. C Wu the Formosans dared to demand his replace-
ment with a native. Come what may, a growing number of
Formosans are planning to offer a native candidate for the
presidency of the Republic of China in the 1954 election pro-
vided that the status quo last till then and thereafter. If not
in 1954 then in 1960, it will be no surprise to find a Formosan
popularly elected President of “China impersonated by
Formosa.”
By 1960, there may have been armed 350,000 native Formo-
sans, most of the KMT top-leaders will have passed out of the
political scene, those Chinese children born and raised in
Formosa will have become assimilated. Now Ch’en Ch’eng’s
War Cabinet with its youngest member about fifty years of age
calls itself a youth cabinet. Yet in function it is something of
an asylum for the aged; for anyone active in dictatorial ad-
ministration continuously for 20 years is aged, be he 50 or 70.
By 1960 hardly any of them will remain good for the new era.
In short, just as the Chinese crowded out the Mongol con-
querors within one century (1279-1368) and absorbed the
Manchu invaders in two (1644-1912), so will the Formosans
eliminate the Chinese refugees in one decade of the status quo.
Should recourse to arms become the only alternative for native
re-emancipation, the Formosan patriots would most probably
by 1960 have overthrown the KMT tyranny as the KMT de-
throned the Manchu Monarchy in 1911.


Amidst the above competing forces the only ray of hope
for the KMT comeback and renaissance is again the earliest
outbreak of the next world war, so that after “victory” de-
mocratic planes and boats might promptly carry the refugees
across the Formosa Strait. That ray of hope, however, is only
one against five stronger contestants. When will the next
great war burst out? Within 1950? Certainly not. In 1951?
Not, either!




IV
FORMOSA’S DEMAND FOR
INDEPENDENCE 1
Though the legal status of Formosa remains undecided
pending the conclusion of the peace-treaty with Japan and its
eventual separation from China, the Chinese have claimed the
Island to be China’s recovered territory and denied the native
Formosans their right to self-determination and independence.
To the KMT, the country is too rich to be lost; to the
CCP, it is a place where Moscow wants to spread
the red curtains over the Western Pacific with Formosa as the
first outpost. Bitter enemies as they are, they have advanced
such implausible arguments against Formosan independence
on the bases of racial affinity and historical contiguity, geo-
graphical proximity and economic interdependence.
Racially , they maintain that because the native Formosans
are Chinese in blood Formosa is inseparable from China. As
a matter of fact, non-Chinese aborigines including the
assimilated ones number almost one tenth of the total
population. As to the rest, though Chinese blood
dominates, constant absorption of Dutch, Spanish, and
Manchu elements in the remote past and of Japanese im-
migrants in the recent time through intermarriage is indisput-
able. Thus, in both race-psychology and physical appearance
the native Formosans have become as different from the Chin-
ese as —if not more than—the Americans are from the English
and the Brazilians from the Portuguese. Even the same race
can segregate into different nations just as several races often
combine into one nation. To uphold any lofty idealism the
Chinese might as well advocate the establishment of a world-
federation since all nations and all peoples are traceable to the
same ancestry. In view of common sense realism, they must
discard their inverted form of aggressive expansionism and

never revive any dream of colonial reconquest by denying the
Formosans the right to self-determination. Nearly seven
million (minus the refugees) in population and next only t}
Japan throughout Asia in industrial development, Formosa
houses a people of over 90% literacy, well-regimented and
law-abiding. Therefore, if the Formosans, possessed of all
essential requirements for forming an independent nation,
want complete independence, they have the right to struggle
for it.
Historically, Formosa was part of China in the past and
must, therefore, become part of China at present and in the
future, both the KMT and the CCP argue. As a matter of
truth, prior to the Dutch occupation of Formosa in 1624 the
Chinese had neither claimed any suzereignty nor exercised any
sovereignty over the country. Following the mass-influx of
Ming patriots into the Island under the leadership of Koxinga
and his successors, Formosa became a sovereign State from
1661 to 1683 when China formed the bulk of the new Manchu
Empire. Between China and Formosa there was constant
feud, war, and bloodshed. From 1683 to 1895 Formosa fell
under Manchu conquest and from 1895 to 1945 under Japanese
rule, during which period of history there occurred “one re-
bellion every five years and one disturbance every three years”
in the continuous struggle for liberty and prosperity. In 1895
the Formosans even declared independence to defy the Manchu
betrayal and resist the Japanese invasion. Thus, Formosa has
never been part of the Republic of China. If she is under no
obligation to become part of China now, but, instead, wants
complete independence, she has the right to such self-deter-
mination.
Geographically, they argue, Formosa being a small island
lying close to the continental mainland of China, should not be
separated from China but become part of it by force of nature.
To be sure, from 80 to 200 miles in width ranges the Formosa
Strait, which thus makes a natural national boundary compar-
able to the Pyrenees and the Rhine, not to mention the Chinese
Great Wall. Besides, it was not any Chinese expeditionary


forces that crossed the Strait by themselves, effected a suc-
cessful landing on the Formosan coast, and brought the
Japanese garrisons to their knees, and thus recovered the lost
territory across the border by military conquest; but US men-
of-war and planes that brought the first groups of Chinese
take-over officials and occupation forces into the Island by
diplomatic favour. Therefore, the Formosans reserve a re-
ciprocal right to ask the US forces to oust those robber-officials
and bandit-soldiers. Worst of all, any argument that a small
country adjacent to a big one has no right to independence
justifies only barbaric imperialism. 'The Chinese, who claim
to have eradicated the last vestige of foreign imperialism from
their own soil, have no right to revive any barbaric imperialism
as such.
Economically , the Chinese assert not only the interdepen-
dence of China and Formosa but even the dependence of For-
mosa on China. On this ground, also, they deny the Formosan
right to independence. In fact, the rehabilitation of Formosan
industries and the reconstruction of the Formosan economic
system is much too great a task for the Chinese to accomplish.
First of all, China is too poor to revive her own industries, not
to mention Formosan industries. Formosa has more indus-
trial plants than China minus Manchuria; the total length of
modern highways in Formosa exceeds that in China. Secondly,
China has insufficient personnel for the task of reviving For-
mosan industries the more so because the take-over officials,
corrupt and incompetent, jealous and arrogant, have failed to
make use of native talent, while ignoring the fact that Formosa
has as many doctors and engineers as the whole China has.
Thirdly, the agricultural products and industrial raw mater-
ials, with rare exceptions, of China and Formosa fail to supple-
ment each other but, instead, compete always and everywhere.
Finally, the economic and industrial systems of Formosa as
regimented by the Japanese were so tightly tied with the
Japanese systems that the efficient transfer of the linkage
from Tokyo to Nanking lies far beyond the technical and
financial ability of the present-day Chinese administrators.


Nevertheless, the KMT and the CCP abhor the loss of Formosa.
Not that China and Formosa are economically interdependent,
but that the Chinese hate the loss of the almost inexhaustible
enemy property and natural and industrial resources in
Formosa. In other words, dependent upon Formosa for their
own wealth, livelihood, and security, certain self-seeking
Chinese, the KMT officialdom above all, cannot tolerate For-
mosan independence. On the contrary, the Formosans, if sure
to achieve economic self-sufficiency and unable to tolerate
Chinese exploitation, naturally want independence.
Nevertheless, both the KMT and the CCP, demanding the
wanton sacrifice of Formosan rights and interests to the altar
of their duel, have justified the necessity of Formosan acquies-
cence in Chinese misrule on the common-fate basis and the
establishment of Chinese autocracy on the native-disqualifica-
tion principle. As a result, they have sucked Formosan blood
but lost Formosan hearts.
The Formosans now want to govern themselves and direct
their own destiny. Not that they are revolting against China,
but that the Chinese in Formosa, as represented by the worst
types of scoundrels, have deserted them. With their group-
consciousness growing into Formosan Nationalism, neithei
Chinese-made nor Japanese-imported, the Formosan patriots
now want complete independence through a plebiscite under
neutral supervision in accordance with the principle and prac-
tice of self-determination and democracy, failing which re-
course to military forcee will be the only alternative.
On the following grounds are based their historical claim
to independence and basic human right to self-determination: —
(1) The Cairo decision to hand Formosa to China was
internationally dictatorial and is therefore not to he recognized.
In spite of the provision by the Atlantic Charter prior to the
Cairo Declaration for the free expression of popular wishes in
case of any territorial change, the Cairo Conference entirely
ignored the Formosans’ wishes by handing the Island to China.
Since people are not chattel to territory nor serfs to land but


human beings with free wills, their wishes should be duly res-
pected, the land they inhabit having no will. The inhabitants
of Alsace-Lorraine, having evidently enjoyed the same liberty,
the same equality, and the same fraternity as the rest of the
Frenchmen, are happy under French rule. But just as under
Japanese rule so under Chinese rule have the Formosans been
oppressed, exploited, and discriminated against and conse-
quently made unhappy. Therefore, if the Formosans now
want independence, they must have reserved the right to it
and must be given a chance to express their wishes freely.
(2) The Cairo decision to return Formosa to China was
technically erroneous. In 1895 the Japanese occupied with
brutal force the Island of Formosa taking it neither from the
Manchus nor from the Chinese, neither from Chiang Kai-shek
nor from Mao Ts’e-tung, but from the native Formosans, who
defied the Manchu decision, resisted the Japanese invasion,
established the independent Formosan Democratic Republic,
and fought the Japanese through fifteen armed rebellions in
half a century. Therefore upon their surrender the Japanese
should have returned Formosa to the Formosans. If the
Formosans want to regain their independence after the Japan-
ese surrender, they certainly have the right to it.
; (3) The Cairo decision was unjust in selling the Formo-
sans * hereditary rights and interests down the river to Chinese
warlords, whose regime of terrorism and dictatorship the
Formosans loathe. Though the Atlantic Charter respects all
peoples’ right to choose the form of government under which
they will live, the form of government under which the Cairo
Conference decided to place the Formosans has been and will
be the worst type of Chinese despotism, whether KMT or CCP.
What the Formosans choose to live under is the best type of
democracy. Since unable to establish it throughout China, the
Formosans want it in Forinosa at least. For this purpose they
have to break away from China and declare independence.
(4) The Cairo decision is no longer applicable. Since VJ
Day the Russian occupation of Manchuria, which the Japanese


actually stole from China in 1931, has already annulled it and
set a precedent regarding the unapplicability and impracti-
cability of the arbitrary commitment. If the Cairo Conference
ignored Formosan wishes in the past, the Formosans have the
right to ignore the Cairo decision to hand the Island to China,
but, instead, declare independence. Similarly, if US ships and
planes brought the first groups of bandit-soldiers apd robber-
officials into Formosa, the Formosans can by right ask the US
Government to help get them out.
(5) The Cairo decision is not final. Since VJ Day and
before the peace conference for Japan Formosa has been put
de facto under temporary Chinese trusteeship only, but de jure
under the Far Eastern Commission. Technically it is still
part of Japan; theoretically it is an “international soil” and
therefore “neutral.” Therefore, as the Chinese Central
Government moved there it is without a people or tenitory and
should be considered as an exiled government. The recent
removal of the KMT Capital to the Island reveals their persis-
tent intrigue to engulf the international soil of Formosa into
China’s civil war more evidently than their utilization of the
Island as base for blockading the Chinese coast has done—an
unmanly struggle which amounts to an open violation of the
International Law of Neutrality. During the indecisive period
the Formosans have the right to make all necessary prepara-
tions for independence so as to accomplish it as early as
possible.
(6) The Cairo decision is no longer valid. Since the fall
of Nanking and Shanghai the worsening inability of the KMT
regime to hold out against red expansion in China and invasion
of Formosa has invalidated the Cairo decision to hand the
Island to China. Instead, the United States and Great Britain,
co-signatories to it, who were also co-authors of the Atlantic
Charter and have been leading champions of democracy, have
the right to get the KMT officialdom out of it and treat
Formosa as a security zone inside the democratic defence line
in the Western Pacific. Because strategically the Island may
be regarded as the Malta of the Western Pacific where no de


fence system can be complete with Formosa being held by
hostile or incompetent elements. The CCP, taking orders from
Moscow, is hostile to the Democracies; the KMT, rotten to the
core and disliked by native Formosans, is incompetent to keep
off the CCP. Wanting democracy in Formosa, the Formosans
also want to join the democratic defence system and any Non-
Communist Pacific Union. If China fails to keep Formosa
within the democratic orbit, Formosa as a measure of self-
defence and of consolidating the collective security of the de-
mocratic nations has the right to declare independence.
(7) China by her administrative-failures in Formosa has
automatically forfeited her claim to it if any. For over five
years after VJ Day the Chinese take-over officials and occupa-
tion forces have been preaching fraternal reunion but practis-
ing colonial conquest and committing such political outrages as
extortion and oppression, discrimination and exploitation, kid-
napping and massacre, which has killed all Formosan loyalty
and enthusiasm. Such misrule has disqualified China *&s a
trustee power in the Far Eastern Commission. If any trustee
power has lost her qualifications, the mandated territory
should be entitled to a change for better rule. There is no
reason, legal or moral, why the democratic nations should
support refugee tyranny over the down-trodden natives. Nor
can there be any ground for the US Government, whose people
have been traditionally sympathetic with colonial revolts and
aspirations for self-determination and independence, to help
the “Maximilian” against the “Mexican.” Therefore, when
the Formosans want to replace misrule with home rule, they
have the right to declare independence in accordance with their
freely expressed joint-wishes-
(B) Because Communist-dominated China has become a
vassal to Russia, Formosa in order to evade Red vassalage and
preserve national freedom has to break away from China and
declare independence. The CCP, whose expansion the corrupt
KMT has failed to prevent, is not only more tyrannical and
destructive than the KMT but even subservient to the Third
Internationale and traitorous to the Chinese nation. Afraid of


native mutiny, the Chinese Government in Formosa dared not
arm the brave Formosans and thus disabled them to participate
in the anti-Communist campaign. They may bluff and claim
to have converted the Island into a citadel and placed it under
a liberal provincial government so as to milk the United States
for more money. Yet their troops being good for looting but
not for fighting, entombing rather than entrenching themselves
along the Formosan coast, the paper-made tiger will collapse
before the invading Reds unless strengthened by native co-
operation and further foreign aid. Among the native Formo-
sans there are at least half a million high-spirited, able-bodied
young men, who, when well-armed and-led, and, above all,
under an independent native regime, will fight to the last man
to defend their own country against Red invaders but not for
the KMT overlords. They must first of all achieve political
independence and secure spiritual liberty and material pros-
perity in order to keep the CCP off their native Island at
present and in the future help liberal elements of China re-
emancipate themselves. In other words, China has gone
“Vichy,” Formosa must go “Free”!
(9) Juridically the Chinese Government in Formosa is
not entitled to function any longer. Formosa remaining an
“international soil,” the Chinese Government sheltered there is
an ejected regime and has no right to administer the state
affairs of the country. On June 27, 1950 even President
Truman of the United States of America openly declared that
the present status of Formosa remains undecided pending the
United Nations consideration or the Japanese Peace Confer-
ence. If the general well-being of the seven million Formosans
outweighs the personal interest of one Chiang Kai-shek, the
refugee KMT tyranny must be replaced by an international
administrative committee appointed by the United Nations
pending the holding of a plebiscite for independence. To
justify such an unjust action as commtited at Cairo is irra-
tional ; to declare the present status of Formosa undecided but
continue recognizing the refugee tyranny there is self-
contradiction.


(10) In industry and population , cultural advancement
and social organization Formosa is comparable with the majori-
ty of the independent nations in the present world and there-
fore deserves to become independent. If there appear any inter-
national administrative committee to take over the government
units from the ejected Chinese regime, it must be a temporary
one. For any permanent trusteeship implies the disqualifica-
tion of the inhabitants for independence and the consequent
revival of colonial rule, against which the Formosans have been
fighting for three odd centuries. As the provision of the
United Nations Charter in Article 76 aims to promote the
advancement of a qualified people towards independence, the
Formosans must be given a chance to freely express their
wishes for independence and thereby determine their own
future destiny.
In short, China, guilty of tyranny and robbery, genocide
and incompetence, in Formosa has no right to colonial recon-
quest and territorial recovery of Formosa; Formosa, betrayed
by Cairo and estranged by China, has the right to self-
determination and independence.
