The Lord sitteth upon the flood/— Psalm xxix., 10

thereof are still/ s — Psalm cvii., 29.
O Thou, whose infant feet were found
Within Thy Father s shrine,

Whose vears with changeless virtue crown d,
W ere all alike divine.
Dependent on Thy bounteous breath,
We seek Thy grace alone,

PREFACE.
| was asked by my child niece, Ruby
Constance Hughes, to write her a
poem. The following is the result of her
request; and thinking that it might interest
other children, as well as parents, I am
emboldened to publish it.
E.G.W.




Part I
The Call.
A Power is with us in the night,
Which made the darkness and the light,
And dwells not in the light alone.
Alfred Tennyson.
A village in an Eastern land
Stood by a sea of azure hue.
A sea which lashed its golden strand
In anger, when the strong winds blew.
This little town, to memory lost,
Amidst the years of “ long ago,'
A ferry kept, and many cross’d
The sea, in journeying to and fro.


A transport law the folks had then,
Which said that after twilight died
o
Twas optional for ferry men
To row a pilgrim o’er the tide
But any one, the rule did state,
Could take the boat and cross the sea
To answer those who might ring late,
No matter what the hour might be.
One wild dark night which closed a day
Of festival, the bell was heard
Long after twilight died away ;
Again it rang—but no one stirr’d


To heed its calling, for said they
In seltish wise : “ Oh I Let him be,”
“ We’ll row him o’er at break of day ;
Too rough to-night to try the sea.”
How oft when comes a chance to do
Some good to others, great or small,
The chance is lost, because we knew
’Twould cost us something ; yet, not all
The efforts that we later make,
Will for that one lost chance atone ;
Then let us selfishness forsake
For that which “ seeketh not her own.’


For all can help in little ways,
(He, who receives, can always give),
And strive to brighten some dark days
Through which the struggling ones must live.
The widow, who did cast of old
Her mites within the treasurv court,
%/ '
Did tarry not till she had gold
To spare, before she offered aught,
But freely gave what she possess’d ;
And thus her offering, though ’twas small,
Within the sight of God was bless’d ;
Who values every gift from all,


According unto what we leave
Gun-elves, when after we have given
T1 xe less we unto riches cleave,
The easier lies the path to Heaven
Outside the Village, no great way,
Paul Gabriel dwelt. Now often he
Had left his home at peep of day,
Or late at night, and cross’d the sea ;
Whatever weather did prevail,
That pilgrims should not ring in vain
He cared not how the driving gale
Might blow, or how it beat with rain.


He heard the bell; the stormy blast
Upon its wings had borne the sound
He wondered if the gale would last
For long, and if there would be found
Regardless of the ocean’s chafe,
A man to cross the seething tide,
And bring the anxious pilgrim safe
To shelter on the haven side.
The reason he himself delayed
To go was this—his child was ill,
And he beside her bed had staved,
And none was there his place to fill


As listened he and wondered then,
Who, late and waiting could this be,
The wind bore on its wings again
The gentle tinkling o’er the sea.
In slumber calm his child’s bright eyes
Were closed then, and Gabriel said
Thus to himself : “ Would it be wise
For me to venture forth instead
Of chancing that another might
Be moved to hearken to the bell ?
On such a dark forbidding night,
Which course is best ? ’Tis hard to tell.


“ I’ll venture out,” he said at last,
“ My little girl seems fast asleep ;
Though dark the night, and wild the blast
Til bring this pilgrim o’er the deep.”
T pon the child one anxious look
He cast, and gently left her side,
Then to the shore himself betook,
And launched the boat upon the tide
End of Part I.


Part JI.
The Answer
“ And, behold there arose a great tempest in the sea, inas-
much that the ship was covered with the waves. . . . Then
He aiose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was
a great calm.”— Matthew viii. 24-26.
The early eve had set in mild,
With scarce the faintest wind to fan :
Pale twinkling stars of Heaven smiled
Upon the shadow’d sphere of man.
But ere a few short hours had down,
A change came o’er fair Nature’s face
As suddenly as o’er our own,
W hen troubled thoughts the calm displace


Then clouds soon overspread the sky ;
At midnight all was dark and weird,
Save for the moon s pale crescent high,
That through the scud at times appeared
A greater dreariness was lent
The night by the loud breakers’ roar,
As each in quick succession spent
Its energies upon the shore.
High on the waves the boat was tossed,
The spray was lashed to blinding foam,
And Gabriel, though he’d well-nigh crossed
Half wished he had not left his home.


He plied his oars with all his strength ;
The boat went fast before the tide,
And through the darkness reached at length
The landing on the other side.
“ Who seeks at this time to be cross’d ? ”
The hour is late, the night is wild !
And Gabriel stood in wonder lost,
When through the dark he saw a child
“ Who sent thee forth at such an hour,
And art thou not afraid to ride
The troubled waves, while tempests lower?
“ I do not fear,” the boy replied.


“ My father sent me forth to find
%j
The sheep that from his fold do stray,
And He, svho walks upon the wind,
Will guide me safely on my way."
Then on his arm, the strong man bore
The fearless boy aboard the boat,
With gentle care ; then left the shore,
But now the second time afloat,
A harder task before him lay,
The storm increased, and for the lad
He feared. “ There’s danger in our way
.V rougher night we’ve never had.”


“ It seemeth strange indeed that he
o
So young, should thus he so intent,
That e’en the raging of this sea
Hath not the power to stay the bent
“ Of purpose borne within his breast.
His trust in God hath put to shame
My wavering faith. Would I possessed
This childish trust in His blessed name.
When they were half-way o’er the main
The stormy gale was at its height,
And Gabriel’s strength began to wane-
The tempest overtaxed his might.


Then fear his manly heart did chill ;
He wished he had not heard the hell ;
The heaving waves commenced to fill
The troubled boat he rowed so well
Oft when we’re tossed upon the waves
Of strong Perplexity’s wide main,
And prone to doubt the Power that saves
From adverse winds of grief and pain,
As on the Lake of Galilee
He whispers “ peace ! ” and all is still
He chides us gently—sets us free
From every dark impending ill


While Gabriel thought, with great alarm,
The ferry-boat would founder soon,
There fell a deep mysterious calm
O’er wind and wave—out shone the moon.
Now plainly could the child be seen,
His face to Gabriel, wondrous fair,
Revealed amidst a lovely sheen
Half circled o’er his golden hair.
When Gabriel saw the cresent shine,
He trembled much, for it revealed
The sacred form of One divine
The Child - Christ stood. The boatman
kneeled.


Full well he knew the Pilgrim then.
The Child Immanuel, Heavenly Guest.
Who taught the priests and learned men
Of things concerning God’s behest.
Revealing mysteries of His word.
And all their learning did eclipse.
And made them marvel as thev heard
m
Such wisdom from His baby lips.
Who wandered from His parents' sight.
To them unknown. And there within
The Temple walls, showed forth His might
To teach and save all men from sin.


Soft fell His words in accents clear :
“ Fear not, peace unto thee and thine !
Oft hast thou gone when nights were drear,
When strong winds surged the billow’d brine,
“ And brought a pilgrim o’er the tide ;
And this most trying night of all,
Didst leave thy little girl’s bedside
To heed the midnight ferry call.
“ The sickness now has left her free,
She shall not meet with other harm,
And I’ll for ever with thee be,
And guide thy steps through storm and calm


“ Remember this, when e'er thous t done
Kind deeds, from thoughts of self free,
Or tried to aid a helpless one,
Thou didst it, Gabriel, unto Me. 1
The oarsman found himself alone,
His boat moored to the haven strand,
He rose with thanks to God, who d shown
So much to him.— In sweet dreamland
He found his child when he returned,
Who slept in perfect peace the while,
Xo longer now the fever burned,
Nor would it stay her waking smile.
End of Part IT


Part TIT.
The Epilogue.
“ Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shaft find
after many days.”— Eccles. xi. i.
You promised once that you would call
Upon some little ailing friend ;
Or if perchance it did befall
You could not go, that you would send
A kindly message and explain.
Our moments pass on fleeting wings.
Some chances never come again,
So take the ones that each day brings.


You promised once you would forgive
A grievance held against another ;
Then do so now, while still he live,
Ere death step in and take thy brother.
When good thoughts prompt your mind to
Some kindly act for any one,
•/ J
Tis, when the power’s reposed in you,
For you to see that it is done.
And now I will put down my pen,
And wish you children all farewell :
When musing sometimes now and then,
Remember Gabriel and the bell.
The End
