NELSON
White soul of England's glory, sovereign star !
Ne'er shall disaster beat her down nor shame,
While still she sees thee by the leaping flame
That kindled o'er Aboukir, near and far,
Or feels thee quivering through the onset's jar
That filled the North with fear of England's name,
Or trembles with the joy of ail the fame
That died and cast out death at Trafalgar.
Thy name was lightning, and like lightning ay
Thine onset shivered, far and swift and fell :
Ever thy watchword holds us, and whene'er
The fierce dawn breaks, and far along the sky
Roars the last battle, yet with us 'tis well —
We keep the touch, thy hand and soul are there.

Designed and performed by the Students of the National Gallery, under
the supervision of Mr. L. Bernard Hall.
" Not long after, venturing from his concealment, he hazarded an experiment of consummate
art. Accompanied only by one of his most faithful adherents, he entered the tent of the Danish
King in the guise of a minstrel ; and being admitted as a professor of the mimic art to the banqueting
room, there was no object of secrecy that he did not minutely attend to, both with eyes and ears.
Remaining there several days, till he had satisfied his mind on every matter which he wished to know,
he returned to Athelney, and assembling his companions, pointed out the indolence of the enemy and
the easiness of their defeat.

2. TABLEAU-" THE SIGNING OF MAGNA CHARTA."
Miss SingletcK, Mr. Joy and Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery
The defeat of John at Bouvines, in France, left him at the mercy of the nobles, who weVc
incensed at his interference with their liberties, and at the heavy impost of scutage, or shield money,
which he had levied upon them. At one moment he found himself ' With seven knights at his back,
and before him a nation in arms.' Greatly against his will, he met the nobles at the island of Runny-
mede, in the Thames, between Staines and Windsor, and here the Great Charter, the mainstay of
English liberty, was discussed, agreed to, and signed in a single day.

To sit the guardian of the continent!

And flourishing so near her prince's eye.

Percy Leasoo and Louis Foulet
On Sunday, 29th April, 1770, H.M.S. " Endeavour" anchored for the first time on the coast
of New Holland about two miles within the entrance of what Cook named Sting Ray Bay, but what is
now known as Botany Bay. The blacks, who at first took the " Endeavour " for a large bird, assailed
the invaders with spears, but were speedily pacified with an innocuous discharge of smaii snot. Be.ore
sailing on to the discovery of Port Jackson, Cook made a careful survey of the bay. Ihe first man to
set foot on Australian soil is said to have been Isaac Smith, Mrs. Cook s cousin, who leapt out of the
boat in response to an order from the captain, " Jump out, Isaac.

There was a sound of revelry by night
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her Beauty and her Chivalry—and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men ;
A thousand hearts beat happily ; and when
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spoke again,
And all went merry as a marriage bell.
But hush ! hark ! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!

Pass through the glimmering gloom,
And flit from room to room.
And slow as in a dream of bliss,
The speechless sufferer turns to kiss.
Her shadow, as it falls
Upon the darkening walls.
