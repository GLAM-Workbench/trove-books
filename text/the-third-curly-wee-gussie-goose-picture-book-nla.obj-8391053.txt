TENS OF THOUSANDS of boys and girls who were not born with a
silver spoon in their mouths have won for themselves a place of
usefulness and happiness in the world because they started in the
right way.
Money is not everything, but if, when you have it, you don't use
it wisely, you can spoil good chances.
If you do use it wisely it will back up every worth-while ambition.
Start early to learn how to use money wisely. Save early for later
opportunities. Now is the time to save.
“B( 5 ready and your chance will come’’ was Abraham Lincoln’s
message to the youth of his day. It is still true.

A VISITOR
As Curly Wee was sitting in his writing room
one day,
The faithful Jenkyns entered in his well-
trained, noiseless way.
“A person whom I’ve never seen ’as come along
to call,
’E looked so very shabby that I’ve left him in
the ’all.”
Count Curly frowned. “His shabby clothes don’t
matter in the least.
Remember, Jenkyns, if you please, that clothes
don’t make the beast.
Fine suits are not a sign of worth nor tattered
coats a sin.
I am no snob,” said Curly Wee. “Please show
my caller in.”
"I BEG YOUR HELP"
“It’s Mr. Giant Panda, Sir . . Count Curly
gave a shout.
“Well, WELL !” A radiant smile was spread
across his noble snout.
“I’m VERY glad to see you here !” . . . another
radiant smile. . . .
“What brings you to my study all the way from
Monkey Isle ?”
The Giant Panda stretched himself on Curly’s
comfy chair.
(I fear he made some oily marks upon the
cushions there.)
“I’ve worked my passage here,” he said, “across
the miles of sea,
To ask you, BEG you for your help, most noible
Curly Wee !”

FAMILY TROUBLE
“Yon saved my life upon that Isle,” replied
Count Curly Wee.
“If I can now repay that debt, repaid that debt
shall be !
I know that I have many faults.” (WE know
that he has none !)
“But not my fiercest foe could say Ingratitude
was one !”
“Then, hear,” the Giant Panda said. His eyes
were rather wet,
“I’ve had some dreadful tidings from my family
in Tibet.
Their town has been destroyed by floods, by
earthquakes and by fire . . .
And now, if you will read this note, you’ll see
their plight is dire !”
FOOD AND CASH WANTED
Count Curly read the anguished note from Giant
Panda Town,
How all the buildings had been burned or else
had tumbled down.
“And if we can’t get food and cash,” the tragic
letter re^d
“The Giant Pandas in this town will shortly all
be dead.”
Send help to Giant Panda Town. That’s what
the Pig must do.
Send lots of money from the bank to build the
town anew.
Count Curly’s heart was deeply stirred—unlike
most pigs of rank—
“l’ll go immediately,” he said, “and call upon
my Bank !”

TO THE BANK
This Fur-and-Feather Bank was closed, when up
dashed Curly Wee.
(The time was just a fraction of a second after
three.)
But when the bank clerks heard his step out-
side their gilded door,
“Come in !” they cried, “For Pigs like you we
do not close till four !”
“I want to see the Manager,” Count Curly told
the clerks.
See, here he comes to meet the Pig with loud
and genial barks.
(That shows how Curly Is esteemed, for as a
general rule
Bank managers are most aloof, with manners
very cool.)
"IT CANT BE DONE"
The pair are in the Private Boom in Fur-and-
Feather Bank.
“Now tell me frankly,” said the Pig, as in a
chair he sank,
“What money have lin the Bank ? What cash
can I put down ?
Have I enough to build anew the Giant Panda
Town ?”
The Manager he hummed and hawed. He shook
He looked at leather ledger books with figures
marked in red.
“Although you’re rich . . .” (The Banker’s brow
was furrowed in a frown),
“With all the money you possess, you can’t
rebuild a town !”

THE GREAT APPEAL
Though Curly hasn’t got the cash, he’s not a
bit cast down—
He’ll find a way to bring relief to Giant Panda
Town !
“We’ll launch a Great Appeal !” he cried. “Yes,
that is what we’ll do—
We’ll touch all Fur-and-Feather hearts
and touch their pockets, too !”
The Great Appeal was quickly launched by
noble Curly Wee.
He wrote a letter to the press for everyone to
see.
He opened a Subscription List . . . His name
was at the head . . .
“Count Curly gives a Thousand Pounds !”
admiring club-dogs said.
FLAG DAY FIRST
Of course, they have a Flag Day first, for, I
need hardly say,
No Great Appeal is ever made without that sort
of day.
. . . Miss Daisy did a roaring trade. She some-
how had the knack—
No passer-by could pass HER by, or disregard
her QUACK !
Kind Lady Bun sold flags as well . . . but
she was rather feared.
Not only was the victim caught, but he or she
was SPEARED.
With Lady Bun (if you were wise) you grabbed
the flag and pin,
And cried, “No thank you,’’ when she squeaked
“Do let me feex it in.”

EVERYONE GIVES
The little Rabbits wish to help, and here, as you
can see,
They open money-boxes up—by poker or with
key.
The pennies that they’ve saved each day for
weeks and weeks and weeks,
They very gladly give awa.y with happy little
squeaks.
Old Mrs. Horse was not content with merely
selling flags.
She tied up home-made chocolate fudge in
crinkly-paper bags.
. . . Although the fudge was over-cooked, and
black, instead of brown,
Kind neighbors bought it up in aid of Giant
Panda Town.
MR. FOX AGAIN
They also got a Whist Drive up for Giant Panda .
Town.
Admission—which included tea—was only half-
a-crown.
They made a Mile of Pennies, too, which
stretched along the street.
But almost half-way up the mile the pennies did
not meet.

without mishap, occurred. __ .

COUNTING THE MONEY
The money is collected now, they’ve stuffed it
all in sacks,
And now it’s carried to the Bank on Rabbit
porters’ backs.
. . . Bank clerks, of course, are used to cash;
they handle quite a lot.
But even they upon this day were heard to say,
“Great Scott!’’
Oh, see them counting up the cash for Giant
Panda Town—
Each ha’penny, penny, sixpence, every shilling
and half-crown.
Just hear the crackle of the notes—a lovely,
lovely sound—
As all are neatly stacked in heaps with rubber
bands around.
"NOT ENOUGH
“Well, what’s the total ?” asked the Pig when
they’d had time to count,
“I’m waiting eagerly to know—what is the full
amount ?
Can we rebuild the ruined town with all the
cash we’ve got ? . .
The Banker looked a little sad. “I rather fancy
NOT . . .’’
“You’ll have to find more money yet . . .” The
Banker’s voice was gruff,
“Although you’ve done extremely well, there
still is not enough.’’
. . . Poor Curly Wee ! He is, you see, with
disappointment filled.
“I never thought a town would be so costly to
rebuild !’’

fiMB tVE GOT IT MHH
A GRAND IDEA!
“We’ll have to raise more money still. What IS
there we can do ?”
Count Curly Wee is wrapped in thought, and
so is Gussie, too.
That high and noble brow we know is furrowed
in a frown,
“How CAN we rake the money in for Giant
Panda Town ?”
“I’ve got it !” This was Gussie’s cry which rang
the study through,
“We’ll have a Show ... a Pantomime ... an
Amateur Revue !
We’ll hire a stage where we can dance and act
and croon and hum !
We’ll sell the tickets for the cause, and every-
one will come !”
"BOOK" TO BE WRITTEN
An Amateur Dramatic Show ! It was a good
idea !
The whole of Fur-and-Feather Town received
But first there is the “Book” to write. And
this, of course, must come
From Curly Wee’s best fountain pen with nib
it with a cheer. of platinum.
. . . The Goat, who fancies he can act, is sure . . . The Pig starts writing all day long and
he’ll get a part. far into the night.
At once he starts reciting verse that he has “Now, Sir, DO stop,” his valet begs. “It’s time
learnt by heart. you had a bite.”

SONGS AND SCENERY
The Amateur Dramatic Show ! Oh, what a lot
to do !
Our Gus composes all the songs—the words and
music, too.
With tripping, goose-step melodies his feathered
brain is stored.
(Just now he’s looking rather blue because he’s
lost a chord.)
The Amateur Dramatic Show ! See Colonel Bull-
dog’s son—
He’s painting all the scenery. (Just wait till
it is done !)
He studied Art abroad, you know, and that of
course is why
He wears his hair a little long and sports a
satin tie.
"ONLY OUT AT NIGHT"
That Amateur Dramatic Show ! Too soon, I
am afraid,
They all forgot the Charity of which it was in
aid.
And each inquired from everyone with much—or
little—tact,
“Have YOU been asked to sing or dance ? Have
YOU been asked to act ?”
The ones who’d NOT been asked to act were
often very peeved,
And went about with angry looks and manners
most aggrieved.
That’s why the Pig (who chose the cast, as you
will realise)
Went only out for walks at night a-wearing
strange disguise !


DANCERS
I -^
— 4a1 s ' I
That Amateur Dramatic Show! Rehearsals
now begin.
Just see the Rabbit Ballet Girls who on their
tip-toes spin.
. . . “Again !” the Dancing Mistress squeaks.
“Extremely badly kicked !”
(My word, she keeps them up to form because
she is so strict !)
Miss Daisy Duck is quite a star, and she’s
rehearsing, too.
She means to dance the famous dance Pavlova
used to do.
. . . “Don’t look so PLEASED !” the Teacher
squeaks, “Look languid, sad and weak—
You shouldn’t dance the ‘Dying Swan,’ a grin
upon your beak !”
HE SHOWS THEM HOW
The Amateur Dramatic Show! Rehearsals
every day !
Count Curly helps the actors who are acting in
his play.
Now, here he’s coaching Ginger Dick (who has
the Hero’s part),
He tells him what he doesn’t know about
dramatic art !
“No, no!” he tells Inspector Goat, “Watch me,
and act like this—
The Villain that you have to play must roll his
eyes and hiss !
Now, Goat, repeat your lines once more . . .”
(I think you’ll all agree
A really gifted actor has been lost in Curly
Wee !)


lif *,-5*1
HEROINE AND "VILLAINESS"
The Amateur Dramatic Show! Rehearsals
twice a day !
Old Mrs. Horse has got the part of Heroine to
play.
(I know she’s no young filly—but when she’s
on the stage
I promise you that she will look a quarter of
her age.)
The Villainess is Lady Bun. She’ll wear
“slinky” dress.
(Her foreign accent is a boon to any Villainess !)
Count Curly hears her say her part, her lip and
lashes curled.
“Quite good,” he grunts. “You’d look a Queen
in any Underworld!”
"TOPIC OF THE DAY"
Of course, in Fur-and-Feather Town the interest
grew and grew—
There wasn’t one that hadn’t heard of Curly
Wee’s Revue.
And amateur theatricals, as I need hardly say.
Were, in all homes and shops and clubs, TELE
topic of the day.
The Postdog, Dustdog, Milkcat, too, discussed
the coming Show—
And, oh, the rumors that went round in circles
high and low !
“I hear the singing isn’t good” ... “I hear the
singing’s fine !”
“The actors know their parts quite well. . . .”
“They haven’t learnt a line !”


ALL BUSY!
Miss Bunny, the costumiere, is working night
and day.
She’s making all the costumes up—hence all the
disarray.
Just see the stuff for ballet skirts, for cloaks and
crinolines:
And in the midst Miss Bunny sits and stitches
and machines.
“A wig to hire ?” bleats Mr. Ram. "Why, cer-
tainly. Of course.”
“I’ll have a dappled, plaited mane,” neighs
smiling Mrs. Horse.
“I need not ask what it is FOR,” says Mr. Ram.
“I KNOW.
I hope to come myself to see the great Dramatic
Show.”
"TEMPERAMENT"
The Amateur Dramatic Show! Rehearsals
still proceed.
But tempers are becoming short . . . yes, very
short indeed !
. . Here’s Mrs. Hen who WILL turn up to see
her Chick rehearse.
And Gus, who tells her to “Clear out!” which
makes the matter worse.
And Lady Bun, that pleasant soul, goes tem-
peramental, too.
She stamps her paws at all the rest and makes
a great to-do.
She tells the Pig, “I shall not act. I feel too
cross and ill !”
(But that is just rehearsal nerves. Not act ?
Of course, she will !)

OFF THEIR FOOD
And now at last the day has dawned —the morn-
ing of the Show.
(I need not say what show it is. By now yon
OUGHT to know!)
“To-day is Friday,” grants the Pig —it is the
thirteenth, too.
“But as for superstitious fears —” he snapped
his trotter, “Pooh !”
I will not dwell upon the fears the actors had
that day.
So nervous was poor Mrs. Horse, she waved her
meals away.
Young Larry Lamb refused his grass and Chick
just pecked at crumbs,
And all felt shivers down their spines and cold
inside their ’turns !
ACTORS ARRIVE
Now, here’s the Stage Door—at the back. The
time is ten-to-five.
And here one sees, in twos and threes, the
actors all arrive.
Inspector Goat and Lady Bun from taxi-cabs
alight—
Some youngsters watch beside the door.
“000-er !” moos Clifford Calf,
“Please, Mrs, Horse, my album’s here. I want
your autograph !”
“Why, certainly!” neighed Mrs. Horse, who
knew that this was FAME—
Oh, dear, they’re looking rather pale ... I She took the pencil in her hoof and boldly
hope they’ll act all right ! signed her name.


IN THE STALLS
It’s ten-past-six . . . and here they come, the
people for the stalls,
The males are wearing stiff white shirts, the
females cloaks and shawls.
The theatre hall is filled with chat—loud bleats
and barks and mews.
One hears the pleasant, “THERE you are’s,”
and “Fancy meeting YOU’S.”
The Programme-and-the-Chocolate Mice, so
sniiling, smart and neat,
Lead everybody down the aisle and murmur
“That’s your seat.”
And everybody pushed along to seats of crimson
plush,
And, goodness, what a lot of noise and, gracious,
what a crush !
WAITING FOR THE START
Six-twenty now ! The theatre’s full—completely
jammed and packed !
Old Mrs. Hen is all on pins to see her daughter
act.
But now she hardly sees the stage. “Oh, Mrs.
Hare,” clucks she,
“I wish you’d please pin back your ears; they
really BOTHER ME !”
See, there’s Jack Rabbit in his stall. He’s
perched up very high.
To all the grumbles from behind he gives a
sweet reply.
“I’m sorry if I spoil your view. But don’t blame
me for that,
I haven’t got the weight to make this tip-up
seat stay flat !”


OVERTURE
Six twenty-five ! Five minutes more and then
they’ll start the Show !
Ah, look ! The Orchestra files in. The theatre
lights turn low.
And now you hear the tuning up of many
The chatter and the rustles cease, because, you
may be sure,
The audience do not wish to spoil the lovely
Overture.
And as they listen to its strains, before their
violins. . . . eager eyes
The Goat Conductor lifts his hoof. . . . The They see (and what a thrill it is !) the Safety
Overture begins.
Curtain rise !
THE CURTAIN RISES
Now let’s pretend we’re in the stalls all sitting
in a row,
And watching, with the Animals, the Great
Dramatic Show;
Let’s make believe that every scene takes place
before our eyes,
And let’s cry, “000 !” with all the rest to see
the Curtain Rise !
Oh, see ... A lovely colored house . . . No, no,
it is a boat !
No .. . Wait! I know. Of course, it is a Noah’s
Ark afloat !
It’s rocking gently up and down on painted
waves of blue.
Oh, watch the painted shutters there, for soon
we’ll see the crew !


7
AUDIENCE JOIN IN
See, there’s the crew inside the Ark. Let’s listen
to their song !
“Old Father No-ah built an Ark, he built it good
and strong;
And who did Father No-ah choose to sail his Ark
so grand ?
Oh, what a joke, he chose the folk of Fur-and-
Feather Land !”
Oh, what a jolly tune it is ! Just listen to the
din !
“Old Father No-ah went a cruise . . .” The
audience MUST join in !
Join in they do—the stalls and all—with mew
and grunt and bark;
They sing until the curtain falls on Father
No-ah’s Ark !
"PROFESSOR" GUS
And now for Item Number Two (the second on
the list);
See, there’s "Professor” Gussie Goose, the great
Ventriloquist.
Upon his knee sits, stiff and straight, a yellow
gosling small—
My word, it’s speaking; yes, it is, although it’s
just a doll !
Oh, my, the cheek that gosling gives ! The way
it answers back !
It keeps the audience in a roar at each amusing
crack.
(And never ONCE, not all the time you hear
the gosling squeak.
Do you SEE Gus, Ventriloquist, as much as
MOVE his beak !)

PROUD MOTHER WATCHES
’Midst shouts and cat-calls of delight, the Goose
at last retires,
(N.B.—A Cat will cat-call at the act he much
admires.)
The Number Card beside the stage is changed
from Two to Three.
And Mrs. Sheep with pleasure bleats, “I know
who THIS will be !”
It’s Larry Lamb, with hat and cane ! By jove,
that Lamb can leap !
(“He just as good as Fred Astaire !’’ exults the
mother Sheep.)
Just see his twinkling, little hooves ! Just hear
the way they tap—
The audience simply shouts with joy, and, good-
ness, how they clap !
"IRISH" CHICK
When Larry Lamb has danced his way across
the polished floor,
The Number Card is changed again, and now
the number’s Four.
And Mrs. Hen, that proud mamma, feels just a
little sick,
Her claws are damp, as once again the curtains
rise ... on Chick.
Oh, look at Chick upon the stage ! She’s dressed
as a Colleen.
And see the painted hills and trees ... It is
an Irish scene.
For Chick must dance an Irish jig, as Irish
chickens do.
(Poor Chick is looking rather green—but green’s
for Ireland, too !)


STAGE-FRIGHT
The band strikes up an Irish air. But why does
Chicken pause ?
She ought to dance her Irish jig on gaily kick-
ing claws.
But still she stands with beak agape, and turns
from green to white.
Of course, you must have guessed what’s wrong.
The Chicken has stage-fright!
“Oh, Ma ! Ma-ma !” chirps little Chick with
red and streaming eyes.
Across the band to Mrs. Hen her timid daughter
flies.
“Oh, Ma. ... I do not want to be an actress
any more. . . .”
And so they ring the curtain down on Item
Number Four,
SHE'S A VEGETARIAN
Next turn in the Dramatic Show is, “Song: by
Brothers Mice.”
Miss Pussy gives a pleasant smile, “I’m sure
this will be nice.”
(She isn’t thinking what YOU think, for I can
tell you flat
She is a veg-e-tari-an, and SUCH a gentle
cat!)
Oh, see the three well-tailored Mice, their
whiskers nicely curled.
(Their song is squeaked in every hole and comer
in the world !)
“Oh, you’re my Bit of Cheese,” they croon
together and in part.
“Yes, you’re the Bit of Golden Cheese that’s
trapped (pp) my heart.”


DANCING DUCK
The Brothers Mice have sung their song, been
clapped and now have gone.
And next appears Miss Daisy Duck to dance
the “Dy-ing Swan.”
A silver spotlight on her plays as, slowly, on
her toes
She sweetly “dies” upon the stage in truly
graceful pose.
As Colonel Bulldog from the stalls observes
Miss Daisy “die,”
That hardened warrior almost feels as though
he’d like to cry.
And Mrs. Cow is greatly moved. She moos,
“So sweet ... so young ...”
And as the tears flow down her face she licks
them with her tongue.
THE INTERVAL
And now the lights go up once more. The
Interval has come.
And everyone begins to talk. Just hear the stir
and hum.
The males go out to smoke cigars (they always
DO, you know),
While all the females keep their seats and
chat about the Show.
Now, young Jack Rabbit leaves his seat to find
the Waitress Mice.
He shows the sixpence in his paw, “Hey, Miss,
I want an Ice.
Some folk drink coflee at this time and other
folk drink tea,
But in an Interval,” he laughs, “Vanilla Ice
for me !”


BIRD SONG
Once more the lights go down again. Once Oh, how can I describe the song, the lovely
more the theatre’s dark. song they sing ?
It makes the audience think of hills ... of
trees ... of flowers ... of Spring.
Illl
■©up* —y
We’re going to hear a “Hymn to Dawn” by
Blackbird, Thrush and Lark.
The stage is dim and empty first . . . then
comes a whirr of wings . . .
And first the Thrush and then the Lark and
then the Blackbird sings.
Old Sheep remember they’ve been lambs . . .
old Horses they’ve been foals . . .
Like morning dew the birdsong falls on tired
and weary souls.
RABBIT BALLET
At length the Bird Choir flies away, and how
the audience wait.
It is the Rabbit Ballet next—its programme
number’s Eight.
. . . Hullo. Some hitch behind the stage.
Whatever can it be ?
We’ll leave the audience in their seats while
we go round to see.
Belinda Rabbit’s ballet skirt. . . . Oh, dear.
it’s far too tight !
(She’s always eating carrots —she has SUCH an
appetite !)
The other Ballet Babbits watch and. wildlv
squeak, “Breathe IN !”
Until Belinda’s dress is hooked, the Ballet can’t
begin !


-a-
SUCCESS-BUT
Belinda Rabbit’s skirt is hooked, and up the
curtain goes.
Just see the Babbits tripping round on tips of
furry toes.
Like butterflies they dip and swoop, revolve,
retreat, advance . . .
They might be Russian Babbits in a Russian
Ballet dance !
The ballet is a great success—except for one
slight thing.
Belinda, spurred by much applause, achieves
a mighty spring.
It is the kind of spring a Springbok would not
scorn—
Although it lands Belinda in the middle of a
horn !
CURLY'S DRAMA
And now for Item Number Nine. Let’s look
what it will be.
The animals are turning up the programme
page to see.
First Scene. The Heroine alone upon a rustic
seat.
Her golden mane flows down her back. Oh,
doesn’t she look sweet !
‘‘Fond Farmyard Hearts”—in Two Short Acts. You’d hardly know it’s Mrs. Horse . . . but
It’s Curly’s Drama, yes ! hark ! A roll of drums.
With Hero and with Heroine, Villain and Vil- That means, of course, she should beware,
lainess ! for HERE THE VILLAIN COMES !


ENTER THE VILLAIN
The Villain enters from the left. Across the
stage he goes.
(We know he is a villain, for he’s wearing
villain’s clothes !)
Just see his sneer, his waxed moustache, his
flashy morning coat.
<1 bet you hardly recognise our worthy friend
the Goat.)
Oh, don’t the audience get a thrill when he, in
manner bold,
Bleats, “Filly, will ’ee marry me and share my
tainted gold ?”
. . . Jack Rabbit finds it very hard to check
his wild, “Hurray !’’
When she (the heroine) replies with gentle
whinney, “Neigh !’’
JACK RABBIT FORGETS
It is a most exciting play ! Whatever happens
next ?
The Villain who has been repulsed is looking
cross and vexed.
But he will trick the Heroine and bend her
to his will.
“Fair Filly, meet me to-night beside the ruined
mill.”
Jack Rabbit’s bounding up and down upon his
seat of plush.
“Don’t trust that Goat!” the Rabbit screams,
though everyone says “Hush !’’
He quite forgets it is a play and almost tears
his fur
When Mrs. Horse (the Heroine) neighs, “I will
meet you. Sir.”


IS IT LADY BUN?
Act Two of Curly’s thrilling play. At Night,
beside the Mill.
A (cardboard) moon shines in the sky, and all
is hushed and still.
Ha ! Here’s the Villain slinking in, and here,
in satin dress,
Comes (is it really Lady Bun?) the wicked
Villainess !
Oh, see the evil couple smile ! It’s just a play,
I know.
And yet it makes us quite afraid to hear their
whispers low.
"Mark where the silly Filly comes !” (The
Heroine draws nigh).
. . . We hear her gentle voice (off stage) neigh,
“Cornin’ thro’ the Rye.”
THRILL ON THRILL
Oil, what a drama ! What a play ! What
dreadful thrill on thrill !
The Heroine is caught and bound beside the
ruined mill!
The Villain chews his dyed moustache, and
mocks at her distress.
And, oh, the hateful chuckles of the sneering
Villainess !
So piteous were the wild appeals the helpless
“Filly” made
Jack Rabbit has to be restrained from leaping
to her aid.
. . . You see, the Rabbit WILL forget it’s only
just a play—
He wants to dash upon the stage and drive
the Goat away !


TOO MUCH FOR SOME
My word, how thrilled the audience is as
Curly’s play proceeds.
The Villain laughs . . . “Oh, spare me, Sir !”
his gentle Victim pleads.
(Excitement is too much for some. The Bull-
dog, as you see,
Has had to go and fetch his spouse some sal-
volatile.)
The Heroine is weeping loud. The Villain
mocks her tears.
The Villainess (our Lady Bun) curls up her
lip and sneers.
But, hark ! What’s that ? A distant bark
above the sound of drums.
The Villain mutters, “Foiled again !” as in
the Hero comes !
HERO TO THE RESCUE
The Hero comes ! The Hero comes ! (The
high spot of the play !)
See how he strides across the stage in proud,
heroic way !
“Now, set that simple maiden there, that
gentle clothes-horse free !’’...
The Villain blanches at his voice—the voice of
Ginger D. !
Oh, see, the Hero draws his sword ! (Jack
Rabbit gives a squeal—
Although it’s made of harmless tin, you’d
think that it was steel.)
Just hear him tell the Villain now, “Prepare
to meet your fate !”
And watch the Villain bite his hoof, with
snarls of baffled hate !


WHAT A FIGHT !
Oh, what a drama ! What a play ! The play
Count Curly wrote . . .
The Hero (i.e., Ginger Dick) attacks the Villain
(Goat).
Just see the gleaming flash of steel ... I mean,
the flash of tin !
Oh, what a well-matched fighting pair ! I
wonder which will win ?
How all the audience love the fight. My word,
but don’t they just!
Jack Rabbit watches with delight each parry,
feint and thrust.
You’d think that he was fighting, too—he
waves his paws about,
And tells the Hero what to do, and yells, “Take
care !” “Look out!”
OF COURSE HE WINS
Now, is the Villain going to win in Curly’s
thrilling play ?
Not he I The Hero always wins, as I need
hardly say.
Jack Rabbit need not show alarm, for look !
a splendid thrust !
The Villain’s down upon the ground and hum-
bled to the dust !
The Hero wipes his sword of tin, he wipes his
noble brow.
And then he sets the “maiden” free with low
and courtly bow.
The Heroine (our Mrs. Horse) remarks with
simpering neigh,
“You are my gallant sav-i-or, and I am yours
for aye !”


J
WHAT APPLAUSE!
“Fond Farmyard Hearts” is nearly done. True
love and Virtue win.
They sing a touching love duet, Hero and
Heroine.
Below them lies the Villain, dead (of course
it’s just “pretend”).
The Villainess drinks poison, too—which makes
a happy end.
“Fond Farmyard Hearts” is finished quite. The
curtain falls, and now
The audience calls the actors out to come and
make their bow.
“Bravo ! Bravo !” The audience yells enthusi-
astic praise,
And Mrs. Horse and Lady Bun receive some
large bouquets.
"AUTHOR, PLEASE!"
The Great Dramatic Show is done, it’s ended
with the play.
But still the audience stamps and shouts and
will not go away.
From boxes, stalls and circle, too, from pit and
galleree
Come catcall, bark and bray and moo, “WE
WANT COUNT CURLY WEE!”
The Curtains part upon the stage, and, pink
and bland and small,
There stands the Pig the audience wants, the
Author of it all.
So let us with the Audience shout, “Bravo !” to
Curly Wee—
Let’s stand upon the theatre seats and cheer
him three times three !


SHOW IS ENDED
Count Curly makes the sort of speech that
Authors always do.
“Don’t thank ME, please. It’s to the CAST that
all the praise is due!”
And, with these few well-chosen grunts, he sig-
nals to the band
And they strike up the National Song of Fur
and Feather Land.
The National Song ! The audience rise—the
dogs and sheep and cats,
The females button on their coats or grapple
with their hats.
But Colonel Bulldog (loyal soul !) stands stiff
the whole song through—
You’d think that he was on parade or at a
State Review.
ACTORS' PARTY
Well, I have told you everything about Count
Curly’s Show.
There’s nothing else for us to do except to
homeward go.
. . . The hall is sad and empty now except for
Mice who find
The combs and gloves and powder puffs the
audience left behind.
But on the lighted stage that night when
Curly’s Show was done
The actors had a midnight feast. And what a
gorgeous one!
And everybody’s health was drunk in sparkling
harmless wine,
And everyone told all the rest, “I thought you
simply FINE !”


GREAT SUCCESS
Next day for Fur and Feather Bank Count
Curly Wee sets out.
And as he trots across the road his mind is
filled with doubt.
“Suppose we haven’t made enough,” he thinks
in some distress,
“Suppose we’ve worked and worked like mad
and all without success ?”
But see ! The Manager comes out with smiles
he cannot curb.
“My dear Count Curly Wee,” barks he, “your
balance is SUPERB !
Give me your noble trotter, Sir !” He shook it
up and down.
“Your show has made enough to build the
Giant Panda Town !”
FLYING RELIEF FUND
“Enough for Giant Panda Town ... to build
it up anew ?”
The Giant Panda (Curly’s guest) could scarce
believe it true !
“Of course, it’s true !” laughed Gussie Goose,
and Curly grunted, “Yes.”
So take the money with you to your people
in distress ”
The Giant Panda’s flying home—for that’s
the quickest way.
Just see his happy, furry face all
bright and gay.
With bags and bags of shining gold th'
is quite weighed down.
My word, just think how pleased th?:
Giant Panda Town !

WRITES TO CURLY WEE
Before this episode is closed, I think I’d better
tell
That Andy Pandy reached his home, and
everything went well:
He found the Giant Panda Town in great dis-
tress and grief—
But oh the difference when he spent the Fund
for its Relief !
“The buildings that had tumbled down, the
buildings that were burned,
Are now,” he wrote to Curly Wee, "re-built by
what you earned.
Please tell the Fur-and-Feather folk that we
shall not forget—
That every Giant Panda feels for ever in their
debt.”
"NAMED AFTER US!"
Yes, Giant Panda Town was saved by gold our
friends had raised.
In Giant Panda Town, you know, their names
are loved and praised.
“And see this letter from the Town,” barks
- Dick to Gus,
ive renamed their streets and squares
after us !”
In Gussie Square (off Ginger Street) in Giant
Panda Town
There stands a marble statue of a Person of
Renown.
And Giant Pandas as they pass take off their
hats and bow —
“For if it were not for that Pig we shouldn’t
be here now !”

COUNT CURLY'S WALK
One morning (it was summer time, and, for a
wonder, hot)
Count Curly started out upon his after-break-
fast trot.
Quite half the houses in the town looked
empty, dark and closed.
* ‘Their owners are on holiday,” Count Curly
Wee supposed.
But while proceeding on his walk, Count Curly
also saw
Some ragamuffins on the kerb, with grimy face
and paw.
Each one was dressed in ragged dress, in
ragged pants and shirt,
And in the gutter made mud pies or dabbled
in the dirt.
NEVER BEEN AWAY
Count Curly said in kindly tones, “The street’s
no place for play.
Why have you youngsters not gone off upon
a holiday ?
You ought to make your pies of sand beside
the sparkling sea,
You should have spades and buckets, too,”
said friendly Curly Wee.
UP grunted Patrick Porker then, a, pig so
black and small
"‘Please, sir, we’ve never, never had a holiday at
all.
There’s not a person in our street has ever
seen the sea—
We cannot go on holidays unless we’re taken
free.”

TO CAMP INSTEAD
Count Curly HAD been going a Cruise in
luxury and style.
But watch him tear the leaflets up with self-
denying smile.
“No cruise for me,” grunts Curly Wee, “so,
Jenkyns, do not pack . . .”
And into Curly’s chest of drawers the yacht-
ing suits go back.
“The money I’d have spent upon a selfish
pleasure cruise,
I mean” (grunts noble Curly Wee) “in better
way to use.
I’ll buy a lot of canvas tents and pitch them
by the sea,
And all the ragged stay-at-homes shall
camp along with me!”
"NAMES WANTED"
“Count Curly’s Camping Holiday for Young-
sters Left in Town.
Please sign your Names,” the notice ran, “and
put Addresses down.”
. . . Just see the way they all come up ! And
how they gladly sign—
The Puppies, Kittens, Rabbits, Mice and little
ragged Swine.
Before they go on holiday, of course it must
be seen
That everyone has camping kit all nice and new
and clean.
So Gussie goes from door to door in weather
fine or damp,
“I want to see the youngster here who signed
for Curly’s Camp.”


HOW PROUD HE WAS
Then look what Gussie Goose hands out. An
outfit all brand new—
Two pairs of socks, one pair of boots, a bath-
ing costume, too.
Two shirts, a hat (in case of sun) and one good
oilskin mac.
And one big canvas rucksack, too, for every
little back !
Oh, what excitement in the homes that Gus-
sie called upon.
What prancings proudly round the rooms,
what joyous trying on !
Young Patrick Porker, I may say, was filled
with such delight,
His mother found him SLEEPING with his
rucksack on that night!
FINDING A COOK
Before they go to camp, of course, a camp
cook must be found.
Count Curly’s Cook was asked to come. She
shook her head and frowned.
“I hates to disoblige you, Sir, and that’s the
truth,” grunts she,
“But cooking in a camp fire pot is not the job
for me !”
Oh, who will cook for Curly’s Camp ? Aha !
You’ve guessed, of course—
She’s always ready to oblige, our willing Mrs.
Horse.
“I don’t say I’m an expert cook, but I can make
a stew—
I’ll gladly come,” neighs Mrs. Horse, “and
bring young Cuthbert, too !”


p| lyw^
THE GREAT DAY
The Day on which the Campers start! I’m
happy to report
The Sun—who can be very mean—resolves
to be a sport.
That golden fellow in the sky this time de-
serves our praise—
For he is shining hot and clear upon this Day
of days !
By jove, upon this lovely day, it hardly need
be said,
No little Rabbit, Mouse or Pig lay snoozing in
his bed.
When Mothers came to wake them up—as, see,
this picture shows—
They find their children up and washed and
putting on their clothes !
SPECIAL TRAIN
Count Curly for his campers all has booked a
Special Train.
See what a station crowd there is. The porters
all complain.
“Here you ! Come off that luggage truck ! Ter
can’t jump on the tracks !
Oh, dash them little varmints there with ruck-
sacks on their backs !”
Now here’s the engine steaming in. It’s labelled,
“Special,” too.
And as it’s coupled to the tram the little folk
squeak, “000 !”
. . . “I’ll travel in the engine cab,” the bold
young Cuthbert cries.
(But see the engine driver’s face. He thinks
quite otherwise !)


"ALL ABOARD"
“Now, all aboard the Special Train!” cries
noble Curly Wee.
(The Count is in a khaki shirt, with shorts
above the knee,
But does he look undignified ? Good gracious,
not a bit !
He’s every inch his noble self, although in
camping kit.)
They’re scrambling through the carriage doors,
just see the struggling backs.
They’re jumping up on cushioned seats and
sometimes on the racks,
“No need to push !” cries Gussie Goose. His
words are heard by none—
Besides, they like to shove and push. It’s
more than half the fun !
ALMOST LEFT
The Guard has waved his little flag. The
whistle goes as well.
The travellers from their windows give a loud,
exultant yell.
And from the engine funnel now there comes
a puff of steam . . .
“Wait! Wait! You can’t leave me behind It’s
Patrick Porker’s scream.
A porter picks young Patrick up. A door is
opened
And willing paws are gladly stretched to pull
the pig inside.
(For Pat had been to buy an ice—a sandwich
one, and big—
That’s why he almost missed the train, the
greedy little Pig !)


THEY'RE OFF
Puff-puff! The Special Train is off. The
journey has begun !
The platform seems to move away. “Good-
bye !” calls everyone.
“Good-bye, good-bye!” the mothers cry. And
“Don’t forget to write !”
And, “Don’t forget to change your socks !” and,
“Clean your teeth at night!”
Puff-puff ! Through Fur-and-Feather Town
the Special Engine goes.
Past all the old familiar scenes that everybody
knows.
“Look ! There’s a tram !” “See, there’s our
street !” “That chimney’s on our house !”
“And there’s my own back garden wall !”
squeaks little Michael Mouse.
LUNCH TIME
The Special Train is rushing on towards the
shining sea,
And now along the corridor go Gus and Curly
Wee.
They pause at each compartment door, and,
smiling, pleased as Punch,
They tell the little occupants they must pre-
pare for LUNCH.
“Get off the racks,” grunts Curly Wee. “Sit
nicely on the seat,
For no one who is standing up gets anything
to eat.”
Young Patrick Porker, you may bet, does no
more looking out—
He sits upon the carriage seat and licks his
greedy snout!


WHAT A FEED!
See, Gus is handing out the lunch. And what
a lunch it is !
Tomato, shrimp, and egg and cress, and let-
tuce sandwiches.
A slab of cake for everyone, rich, fruity, thick
and brown.
“And ginger pop !” neighs Cuthbert Colt, "to
wash the fodder down !”
Now not a grunt or squeak is heard as all be-
gin to munch.
For no one is too “journey proud” to eat the
gorgeous lunch !
And no one’s scolded if he stuffs and fills his
mouth too full—
It wasn’t like a meal at home, or, for that
matter, school!
TOO MUCH HURRY
The Special Train is slowing down. The jour-
ney’s almost done !
See, there’s the Seaside Station now —and what
a nice clean one.
The salt sea breeze has blown away all trace
of soot and grime,
And round the whitewashed Waiting Rooms,
pink rambler roses climb.
Oh look, what Patrick Porker’s done ! Before
the train has stopped,
He’s opened wide the carriage door and on the
platform hopped.
That was, as every child will know, a DREAD-
FUL thing to do—
I think his bump just serves him right, and
so, I hope, do YOU,


: -£*‘-^
THERE'S THE CAMP
Now everyone has left the train. They’re walk-
ing through the stile.
“Nice weather for your holiday,” the Seaside
Porters smile.
The Ticket Rabbit smiles as well, for, I need
hardly say,
Officials in a Seaside Town are ALWAYS kind
and gay.
Count Curly’s Camp is on a hill just up above
the shore.
“What funny houses !” Patrick grunts. He’d
seen no tent before.
“Now, when you’ve climbed this grassy hill,”
remarks Count Curly Wee,
“I think you will be very thrilled at what you’re
going to see !’”
"THAT'S THE SEA!"
Young Patrick gains the hill-top first. He gives
a kind of shout.
“Oh, look at that!” young Patrick grunts,
with wildly twitching snout.
“The ground down there is blue and white ! IT
MOVES ABOUT !” cries he.
“Pooh. That’s not GROUND,” neighs Cuth-
bert Colt. “Why, Silly, that’s the SEA!”
Stout Cortez standing on his Peak did not get
half the thrill
That stouter Patrick Porker does this day upon
the hill !
He stands a second, silent, awed . . . But in
a minute more
He’s dashing down through whin and briar
towards the golden shore S


WHAT FUN
“The sea ! The sea ! ” yell all the rest. They
fling their rucksacks down.
Oh, what a day for little folk from Fur-and-
Feather Town !
They follow Patrick to the shore with shouts
and squeaks of glee—
And soon the whole of Curly’s camp is splash-
ing in the sea !
Count Curly Wee and Mrs. Horse begin to make
a fire,
For soon they’ll have the meal to cook . . .
AND dry some damp attire.
“My Cuthbert’s such a careless Colt/’ his
anxious mother wails,
“He always paddles in his shoes—and water
rusts the nails !”
SUPPER'S READY
The fire is lit and burning well, the stew pot's
in its place.
The Horse has tied her apron strings and
neighs with smiling face,
“I may not be a fancy cook of dishes rare
and new,
“But” (see her sip the ladle new), “I make a
GORGEOUS stew !”
Gus puts a whistle to his beak. He blows it
shrill and clear,
The sound that tells the campers all that
supper time is near.
“I wonder if they’ll want a meal . . . for if
they DON’T,” thinks he,
‘T won’t complain . . .” (The greedy goose !)
“There will be more for ME !”


DINNER !!! r-v '
Page 40.
CURLY WEE AND GUSSIE GOOSE.
AREN'T THEY HUNGRY?
The sea is good . . . but so is food. And at
the whistle’s blast
They all come pelting up the hill—young
Patrick Porker last.
(He hadn’t thrown his rucksack off as all
the rest had done—
Uphill, and with a rucksack on, it’s VERY hard
to run !)
Now everyone is sitting round the camp fire,
burning bright.
Not want their meal ? Of course, they do,
with SUCH an appetite !
The bowls, held firm in little paws, are stretch-
ed towards the pot,
And everyone squeaks or grunts, “Please, Mrs.
Horse, a LOT !”
BED TIME
The first hours of the holiday, how fast those
hours have sped!
The campers are quite startled when the Count
calls, “Time for bed !”
He stands beside the sleeping-tent, the flap held
open wide—
And while he waits for them to come, let's
take a peep inside.
Oh, see the camp beds in a row all nicely made
and neat,
With white and downy pillows on a smoothly
turned-down sheet.
For every camper Curly’s bought a fleecy,
scarlet rug,
Enough to tuck him in all round and keep him
warm and snug.


CURLY WEE AND GUSSIE GOOSE.

NO BACON
The first day of the holidays has hardly time
to break
Before the campers by the sea are up and wide
awake.
They brush their teeth (the ones with teeth)
and wash their necks and ears—
At least, some wash a little MORE and others
LESS, one fears !
Then, breakfast out of doors. How good, how
LOVELY such meals seem !
Fresh rolls and butter. Honey, too, and cereals
and cream !
(They don’t have bacon as we do, or sausages
to fry-
And, as the reason’s very dear, I need not tell
you why !)
ON THE BEACH
And, oh, the hours the campers spend upon the
golden sand !
What lovely tunnelled tracks are made, what
forts and castles planned !
“See my mud pies !’’ squeaks Michael Mouse—
“so firm and brown and neat—
Far better than the ones of mud I made upon
the street !”
Of course the campers who can swim spend
mornings in the sea.
And Cuthbert Colt starts showing off, for none
can swim like he.
Breast stroke, back stroke, side stroke as well,
and every kind of “crawl”—
They’re just the same to Cuthbert Colt, who’s
expert at them all.


: - - y
S i \
"TEACH US TO SWIM"
“Oh, Cuthbert,” several Rabbits cry, “teach os
to swim ! Do, PLEASE !”
“Teach you to swim ? Of coarse, I will !” the
willing Colt agrees.
“Just watch the way I do the strokes. . . .”
(NJS. —You understand
That furry folk CAN learn to swim in Fur-and
Feather Land.)
But why does Patrick Porker stand a-shivering
at the brink ?
“Come in, come in !” calls Cuthbert Colt, ‘Til
see you do not sink !”
But why does Patrick shake his head and
sadly turn away ?
“He’s just a little Coward Pig !” comes Cuth-
bert’s scornful neigh.
WHY, HE'S CRYING
Count Curly, trotting on the shore, grunts,
“Goodness, what is that ?
There’s someone sobbing by this rock. Why,
what’s the matter, Pat ?
I thought that you were with the rest, and
“I cannot swim,” young Patrick wept, with
bitter tears of woe,
“And when they said they’d teach me how, I
had to answer, 'No !’
The others called me Coward Pig and Baby
happy all day long. Pig . . . 800-hoo . . .
Come, dry your tears, my little pig, and tell And I am sobbing here because . . . because,
me what is wrong.” you see, it’s TRUE !”


( if A H
-
"I WILL!"
“Now, Patrick,” grunted Curly Wee, “Buck up
and dry your tears.
It’s not a crime to be afraid . . . But yon must
CONQUER fears !
So stiffen up your trembling snout, control each
shaking limb,
“And I myself,” said Curly Wee, “will teach you
how to swim !”
“I can’t ... I can’t !” young Patrick wailed,
“I’m SO afraid !” wept he,
“You don’t know HOW afraid I am of drowning
in the sea . .
Count Curly didn’t answer him. He waited,
calm and still.
. . Then Patrick clenched his trotters tight
“All right,” he gasped, “I WILL !”
THE LESSONS START
So all alone with Curly Wee the swimming
lessons start.
And Patrick slips into the waves with wildly
beating heart.
“One, two AND three,” says Curly Wee . . .
“That’s how you should begin.
Keep up your head, kick out your legs and I’ll
support your chin.”
When dinner time came round that day, the
Colt sneered with a wink,
“Well Patrick, have you been a WALK upon
the ocean’s brink ?”
Young Patrick blushed at Cuthbert’s sneer, and
no reply made he.
But, “Patrick has been out with me,” announced
Count Curly Wee.


NOBODY CAN SEE
Next day the Colt went down to bathe and to
the rest he neighed,
“Huh ! Patrick Porker isn't here because he is
AFRAID.”
And all the Rabbits and the Mice sneered,
“Pity about HIM.
He is a little ma-ma’s pig and too afraid to
swim !”
But, in a cove, a mile away, where nobody
could see.
Young Patrick’s learning hard to swim. No
coward now is he !
Count Curly Wee is VERY pleased. He tells the
puffing Pat,
“You’ve swum three yards all by yourself !
Now what d’you think of THAT !”
ATTACKED BY CRAMP
One day the Colt went out to swim from Curly’s
Seaside Camp,
When all at once his legs felt cold . . . He
Then Cuthbert waved his hoofs on high, “Help !
Help !” he wildly neighed.
hen all at once his legs felt cold . . . He The Mice and Rabbits heard his cries, but, oh,
whinnied, “Golly ! Cramp !” they were afraid.
(And, as you children ought to know, HOWEVER
well one swims,
One simply cannot move a yard when CRAMP
attacks one’s limbs !)
they were afraid.
“We can’t swim out so far,” they wailed. “To
try would be no use !
. . . And Curly Wee is not in sight and nor is
Gussie Goose !”


—
PIG THAT WAS AFRAID
“I’ll save him,” Patrick Porker shouts. And all
the rest squeak “You ?
A Pig that’s too afraid to swim ! Whatever can
YOU do ?”
But Patrick doesn’t bandy grunts. As quickly
as can be,
He flings his shoes and jacket off and jumps
into the sea.
Oh, see the Pig that couldn’t swim, the Pig
that was afraid,
The Pig that everyone had mocked, of whom a
butt was made—
He’s forging strongly through the waves with
steady strokes and true,
To where the slowly sinking Colt lifts up one
(rusty) shoe.
HE'S SAVED HIM !

fn ssy-.'L —
_ __ —5 - / >^‘
Look ! Patrick Porker’s caught the Colt. He
grabs him by the ears.
He turns him over on his back and to the shore
he steers.
The little watchers on the beach are breath-
less with surprise—
“To think that PaPt can swim like that! We
can’t believe our eyes !”
On, on towards the shore he comes, with Cuth-
bert Colt in tow.
Though Patrick is becoming tired, he won’t
give in, you know.
He mutters grimly through his snout, “Just one
last effort more !’’
. . . Hurrah ! His feet have touched the sand.
He’s dragged the Colt ashore !


r
SAVED FROM DROWNING
See, Cuthbert Colt is safe and sound, but on
the sand he lies.
“Restore his circulation, boys !” a clever Rabbit
cries.
They rub his cramped and frozen limbs until
they hear him neigh,
“I've pins and needles in my legs. The cramp
has gone away.”
Then Cuthbert Colt holds out his hoof. And,
“Patrick,” whinneys he,
“I want to thank you from my heart for having
rescued me.
I much regret I called you Funk and other
names like that.
You’re not a coward pig at all. You are
HERO, Pat !”
CUTHBERT OVERHEARS
They’ve had three weeks in Curly’s Camp beside
the sparkling sea,
And every single day has been as fine as fine
can be.
Though Farmer Sheep upon his farm is bleating
out for rain,
The happy little camping folk are glad he bleats
in vain.
Then, one fine morning, Cuthbert Colt heard
Curly say to Gus,
“We’ll start to-morrow with them all ...” in
grunt mysterious.
“Oh, gosh,” thought listening Cuthbert Colt,
“he means to take us back.”
The Colt stuck out his lower lip, and looked
EXTREMELY black.

"LET'S..
“Returning home . . .” groaned Cuthbert Colt,
“Our holiday is done . . .
To-morrow morning brings an end to all our
joy and fun.”
He told young Patrick what he’d heard, and
Patrick grunted, “Oh,
I BET that means we’re going home ! Dash !
I DON’T WANT TO GO !”
“No more do I,” neighed Cuthbert Colt. And
then he gave a grin,
“Look here, suppose we go and live like Huckle-
berry Finn ?
The others can return to town, but . . then
he whispered low . . .
A smile spread over Patrick’s snout. He mut-
tered, “Righty-ho !”
Next morning with the dawning sun the two
young plotters rose.
They did not wake the others as they both put
on their clothes.
They crept outside the sleeping tent and quickly
sped away.
“Though all the rest return,” they laughed,
“WE won’t go home to-day !”
They went into a seaside cave, and there, in
glee, they sat . . .
They giggled when they heard the shouts of,
“Cuthbert! CUTHBERT ! PAT !”
“Huh ! LET them call,” neighed Cuthbert
Colt, a twinkle in his eye.
“They’ll have to shout until they burst before
we make reply I”

THE OTHERS GONE
At last the shouting died away. And Cuthbert
tossed his mane.
“There’s brambles,” cried the Colt at once.

But we need never leave the sea, and here we’ll
live for good !”
“Of course we will,” replied his friend. “But
. . . have you thought of FOOD ?”
and cockles in the shell.
I’ll search for brambles on the cliff, and you
can take your hat
And use it for a shrimping net.” “0.K.” re-
plied young Pat.
LOOKING FOR FOOD
There’s Cuthbert picking brambles now. (And
here, it should be said,
The brambles were extremely hard, and only
faintly red.)
“I’m rather hungry,” thinks the Colt, “I’ll just
have one to eat . . .”
And then he pulls an awful face, for, UGH ! it
fca’t sweet !
With bramble thorns inside his hoof, the Colt
went back to Pat.
“I hope YOU’VE caught a lot of shrimps inside
your shrimping hat ?”
Young Patrick Porker showed his hat, which
now was wet and limp,
And all that lay inside the crown was just one
little shrimp !


THE MORAL
“Oh . . . let’s go home,” neighed Cuthbert Colt.
He too felt most depressed.
“I’m not like Huckleberry Finn,” he honestly
So off the little couple start. And while they’re
setting out
I’ll point the moral of this tale—in case you

“We’ll have to trudge the whole way back . . Don't grumble when your parents say the

SURPRISE FOR THEM
“We’ll have to walk a hundred miles ...” Then
Cuthbert rubbed his eyes.
“They’ve left the tents just where they were !”
he whinneyed in surprise.
“Hello, you two,” called Mrs. Horse, with kind
but casual neigh,
“I wondered when you’d both turn up. Why
did you slip away ?
“There’s someone there beside the tent . . . The rest have gone a lovely jaunt with Gus and

A SORRY PAIR
Imagine Cuthbert’s shame and grief. See how
he bites his lip.
He hadn’t understood the Count was planning
out a TRIP.
“We thought that they were going HOME !”
grunts disappointed Pat—
“To think that through our foolishness we’ve
missed a trip like that! ”
And when the rest came back to camp, the
laughter and the joy.
“Oh, what a lovely jaunt we’ve had. And
what a time ! Oh boy !
You SHOULD have come with us, you know.
Why did you go away ?”
. . . And Pat did not know what to grunt, nor
Cuthbert what to neigh !
RETURN NEXT YEAR
The seaside is a jolly place, but no one will deny
It’s anything but jolly when the weather isn’t
dry.
I won’t describe the journey home, because there
is no doubt
The journey back has not the thrill which marks
the journey out.
