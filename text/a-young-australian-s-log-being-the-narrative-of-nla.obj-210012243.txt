A YOUNG AUSTRALIAN’S LOG.
We started from Melbourne early on the morning
of the 19th of April, 1855, in the steamer “ Pacific,”
which had called at Melbourne on her way to Eng-
land from Sydney, New South Wales. She was
one of the finest steamers on the Australian line.
Her engines were of eight hundred horse-power,
and I believe that if they chose, they could work
her up to one thousand horse-power. She was
commanded by Captain Thomson, and carried as
many passengers as could be accommodated. We
had also a black swan on board belonging to a
passenger, Mr. Lloyd of Sydney, but it died the
first week of our voyage ; it was rather sickly when
it came on board, and was not strong enough to
bear the sea-sickness.
As we passed through the Heads, or entrance to
Hobson’s Bay, we saw papa’s station, and the houses
of the lime-burners, and their lime-kilns, and the
light-house. saw also the wrecks on the rocks
of Point Nepean, which is the eastern side of the
Port Phillip Heads, on which side is the Quarantine
Ground. The other side of the Heads is called


the Bluff, where a small township has lately been
founded.
As we got clear of the Heads it began to blow a
little, and we all felt rather queer, and most of us
went to bed, which is the best place in such cir-
cumstances ; and the rest soon went below, for the
deck got wet with the spray of the paddle-wheels.
I found some biscuits (which mamma, among other
things, had provided for me) of great use, as I
could lie in bed and eat them, when I could not sit
up and eat what the steward brought me. When
I was able to get up, the steward brought my
breakfast and dinner on deck, but he had to cut up
everything for me on account of my bad hand ; and,
indeed, it was difficult enough to eat it even then,
for when the ship rolled, plate, basin, and self,
rolled too, and with one hand I could not hold on
and feed myself at the same time.
About three days after we passed through the
Heads we sighted a large vessel; so we hoisted our
colours, but she was too far away for us to make
out hers.
April 22. The wind is fair for King George’s
Sound, and the weather is very pleasant. I
made acquaintance with some of the passen-
gers. I now for the first time saw the game of
shuffle-board, which consists of a table of figures
chalked upon deck, and some round pieces of wood
polished very smooth, which you slide along the
deck, either to try for some particular number or
to knock off your adversary’s shuffle-board if it is
on a good number. Some of the passengers began


playing for money, and they used to get excited and
would not give the boards to the others, so that the
game was in a great measure put a stop to. My
hand gradually healed, but I had sticking-plaster
all over it for some time after I had left off poul-
ticing it. One of the passengers was taken ill with
delirium tremens from drinking ; and there was no
doubt but that some one had given him drink, in-
tending to rob him, as I was told the Doctor found
a cheque for eight hundred pounds on the floor,
which he had thrown away. Mr. Lloyd, who was
an owner of the “ Pacific,” took the management
partly into his own hands, I believe. He had his
wife and children on board.
On the 25th of April we reached King George’s
Sound. The entrance to the harbour is very rocky,
barren, and mountainous, and we had to go a very
roundabout way to get through it. We anchored
just before dark, and barely had time to catch a
glimpse of the shore. As it was a fine night, they
had dancing on deck, as there was a good fiddler on
board; and then the crew burnt some blue-lights,
and sent up a few rockets. This was the captain’s
birth-day, so he gave everybody wine and cake for
them to drink his health, and then they cheered him
and made some speeches. It was remarkable to see
how fast the passengers recovered from their sea-
sickness when we got into the still waters of the
harbour, and danced about so differently to what
they would have done a few hours before.
On the 26th, I fished most of the day, and caught
a good number of fish, among which were mackerel,


the same as English, and a fish something like a
mackerel with a yellow tail, called “ Yellowtails,”
and one or two “ Leatherjackets,” which have a
skin like leather, and when you catch them make a
noise like the croaking of a frog; they are great
nuisances to fishermen, as they steal all the baits
and rarely get caught. I did not go on shore on
the 26th, but I went next day, as I was anxious to
deliver a letter which was given to me for Captain
Crossman, the chief in command there, by papa,
and also to see something of the country.
Parrots and rugs are very plentiful and cheap here,
the latter being chiefly made of kangaroo skin. I
left the letter for Captain Crossman, but I did not
see him, as he was gone up the country; he called
on board the next day, but I was on shore, so that
I did not see him at all. I climbed to the top
of a high mountain, and on my way I saw some
very curious plants and flowers; and also some
large ant-hills, some of which went down into the
earth about three feet, and were composed of cells,
which were filled with white maggots, as I ascer-
tained by digging one up with a walking-stick ; and
outside it was about a foot high, and composed of
short little sticks neatly cemented together. The
gentleman I was walking with sunk up to his knee
in one of them, and as I was clambering up, I came
to an enormous one, — it was about eight feet high
and four feet in circumference, and so hard, that I
stood on the top of it, and I could hardly make a
hole in it at all; but when I did, I found that the
cells contained little white maggots, and that the


ants were of a very small red kind. I went in the
evening to see a Corroberry; but it was a very poor
one, and there were not more than a dozen black
fellows who did anything particular; and all that
they did was to run up and down a spear held by
the others, stamping and making a hooting kind of
noise; they had a large fire, for they always per-
form at night. The end of the entertainment was
a kangaroo hunt, in which a man imitated a kan-
garoo and pretended to be eating the grass; and
then another man threw a spear at him, and then
they set up a grand yell and dispersed. The natives
here have a queer custom of gashing their children
in slits on their backs with a piece of broken glass,
and then making them rise in lumps the thickness
of a quill. The slits are about an inch and a half
long. All the natives are decorated in this manner.
Their chief food is rice, flour, sugar. They are
very fond of tobacco and spirits, which they will
do everything but work hard to obtain. A number
of the passengers bought opossums here; the one I
had died, and most of the others came to an untimely
end; as they used to escape and annoy people in
the night. There are a good many black swans,
and one of the passengers shot two in the bay close
to the town and brought them on board. I had a
capital day’s fishing on the 28th with Mr. Brookes,
the second mate, and two or three others, in a long-
boat ; we went down to the further end of the bay,
where there is a wrecked schooner aground on a
shoal which runs about a mile out from the land;
the water is about four feet deep. On one side of the
a 2


schooner there was a deep hollow in which were thou-
sands of fish, and some so large, that one I hooked
pulled me off the side, as he took the bait very sud-
denly and I was not holding on. There were a
great many kinds of fish in the hollow—some of all
the colours of the rainbow, and some with a kind of
spines all over them. Suddenly, we saw the Blue
Peter hoisted, and we had to go back to the steamer
as fast as we could, as that flag is a signal for start-
ing ; it consists of a white cross on a blue ground.
As we passed out of the bay we saw Rabbit
Island, which is inhabited solely by rabbits. Some
of the passengers had gone there the day before to
shoot them, but did not succeed. We soon found
our way to bed when we had cleared the Heads, as
we felt the sea-sickness coming on, which was very
disagreeable.
We had two clergymen on board, and we had
prayers every morning, and Church twice on Sun-
days ; their names were Mr. Winkel and Mr.
Smyth, the former was an Episcopalian minister,
and the latter a Presbyterian. We had some very
rough weather, and most of the passengers were
very sick, until the 3d of May, when the weather
became pretty calm.
On the 4th we spoke a large vessel, named “ the
Thomas Feldon,” and we thought that we should be
able to send some letters back to our friends in
Australia; so directly we saw she was coming near
us, and as the captain thought that we might run
alongside her, we got out our desks and began to
write ; but just as we had got to the middle of


. hem, the captain said there was no chance, so we
were disappointed. We heard that the vessel had
eight hundred Chinamen on board, and was bound
for Melbourne, being eighty-live days out from Hong-
kong, China, and that she had only three English-
men on board, the captain and his two officers.
The passengers now indulged in dancing on deck
if the evenings were line; and as the fiddler played
well, it was very pleasant. It was light till after
nine every evening. My hand now got quite well,
and I was able to use it as well as the other, and I
used to go into the saloon (which was a very hand-
some one), and found that I always got better
meals there than on deck or in my cabin, as I think
that some one used to help himself to the best off
my plate.
Between King George’s Sound and the Mauritius,
we sailed without steam for three or four days, as
the wind was strong and fair, and the captain was
very anxious to save the coals. We made eleven
knots (or miles) an hour with our paddle-wheels
dragging in the water, which was considered very
fast, as we had only two masts—the fore and
mizen-masts; we were all very glad that we had a
wind to take us along for a few days. The cabins
on board the Pacific were very small and crowded,
so that at night, with so many sleeping in them,
they were positively unbearable with heat and foul
air. Some of the passengers began to sleep on deck.
The boxes of the passengers being kept in the hold,
I had to take out and put in every Monday all
the clothes I wanted ; and when, on account of bad


weather, the hold could not be opened, we had to
rummage over our stock of dirty clothes and try
and find something more decent to wear.
There were two men put in prison, or irons,
for fighting ; they were the baker and potato-peeler.
The baker charged the other man with stealing
a fruit-pie, and he denied it; so from words they
came to blows, and then they were handcuffed and
put down into a little dark place made for the
purpose.
We had a concert about this time, conducted and
got up by one of the passengers, and it went off very
well indeed; and there were wine, cake, mulled
claret, &c., furnished gratis, (and also on every
Saturday night, when the captain always gave the
toast of “ Sweethearts and Wives,”) and finished
up with “ God save the Queen,” sung by Mr. Don-
aldson, who was one of the passengers ; and it was
chorused by all except two Americans, who would
not stand up, and who kept their hats on all the
time. We just got to bed in time to escape going
in darkness, for the lights were put out every night
at eleven o’clock to prevent any accidents. Two
or three days after this, we had to begin to steam,
as the breeze we had been sailing under died away
into a perfect calm. We had another concert, which
was much better than the former, and conducted
by the same person and in the same manner. I
suppose that the ladies and gentlemen who per-
formed had gained a little more courage, or some
other reason of the same kind.
On Saturday, the 25 th of May, we passed the


Island of Rodrigue, which is about 330 miles from
the Mauritius. We passed very close to it, and
with a spy-glass could see everything quite plain;
it was rather a large island: the side we passed
was quite barren, and only a few stunted trees and
a few spots of green were to be seen in the way of
vegetation. There is a small town on this island,
but we did not see it. We rapidly left this island,
for we were going at the steamer’s greatest speed ;
and you may guess what that was if I tell you that
the lower part of the funnel was red-hot, and some
of the wood near it caught fire, and they had to
work the pumps on it and the funnel, to put out the
one and to cool the other; and when the water
touched the funnel, it made such a thick steam that
it quite hid the funnel from view.
We first began to see flying-fish now, and one
very large one flew on board; and the first mate,
Mr. Glover, and the captain, said that they had
never seen such a fine one before; and Mr. Glover
got the Doctor to put the fish all right for stuffing
for him.
On the 21st of June we came in sight of the
Mauritius. As we passed along the coast we saw
the beautiful country spread before us like a pano-
rama ; and the sugar-manufactories, with tlicir im-
mense chimneys, and groves of sugar-cane and
cocoa-nut trees; and the pretty little villages, with
a neat little church in the middle, with its tapering
white spire, made it look like a picture, but for the
smoke curling from the chimneys, and the men and


horses and carts moving about, and the waves
breaking npon the shore.
We passed close by the Parsee burying-ground,
which is a small island of about three acres in extent,
and on which is a sort of tower with a grating on
the top, on which they lay the body, and after some
time the bones drop through and lie bleaching in
the sun at the bottom; when they have a funeral,
there is a long procession of boats filled with the
relatives and friends of the deceased. The mouth
of the harbour was completely hidden by two sandy-
looking hills, and there were a great many conjec-
tures as to the time when we should anchor, as the
passengers were all very anxious to get on shore as
soon as possible, both to secure lodgings and get
fruit and other things.
We heard from the pilot who took us into port,
that the Emperor Nicholas the First of Russia was
dead, so all the passengers and crew gave three
cheers for it.
We arrived at St. Louis, which is the capital
town of the Mauritius, on the 22d of June, after
a passage of four weeks exactly from King George’s
Sound. I did not go on shore the first day we
arrived, as it was hardly worth while, as I could
only have stayed a couple of hours at the most, and
because the Captain, who was my banker, was very
busy settling about coals, and I had no money in
hand.
There is a very high mountain here called
Peterbotte, which towers over the rest, and at the


top is a large rock in shape like a decanter-stopper,
which looks as if it was balanced on one end ; only
two or three people have ever been to the top of
it, and I believe that they were sailors. Almost
directly we got into the harbour a number of
boats came alongside, and a great many of the
passengers went on shore, among whom was Mr.
Lloyd, who was anxious to secure apartments for
his wife and children, as there were scarcely any to
be had.
I went on shore the day after we arrived with
the Doctor. The first thing that we saw was a large
fountain, which is always pouring water into the
sea, which is very convenient, as ships’ boats can
get their casks filled without landing them. There
is a very large shed at the landing-place, where
they keep all the sugar till it is shipped, and all
about the ground was nothing but spilt sugar and
molasses. The Doctor went to the hospital and
took me with him; it was not a very pleasant place,
and the inmates were chiefly poor blacks, who were
lying all about the place on wretched beds with
hardly any covering, and with all manner of
diseases; and at one place there was a wooden
frame covered over with green baize, where, the
warder informed us, that Dr. R kept his can-
cer patients ; but I would not go in, as I was getting
quite unwell. After we came out of the hospital,
we went for a walk through the town and the
markets, which are very fine ones. Their names
are the Fish-market, the Fruit-market, and the


Meat-market. In the Fruit-market there is a
bazaar for the sale of fancy articles. All the trades-
men in the markets are blacks. The markets are
covered over with roofs supported on pillars; the
people bring their piece of matting, spread it on the
ground, and then place their wares all around it and
squat down in the middle. They talk a mixture
of English, French, Malay, Hindoostanee, and
Madagascan; there are also people always loiter-
ing about the gates, who, for a few halfpence, will
translate for you and carry for you all the things
that they possibly can, and be well satisfied with
what you give them.
If you wish to get anything worth having, you
must get up at four o’clock in the morning, and go
on shore, for that is the time most of the residents
get up ; but they do not work in the middle of the
day, but take what is called a siesta, or noon-day
sleep, and work in the evening. The town of St.
Louis is divided into two parts ; one of which is
called Black Town, where all the poor blacks live;
and the other St. Louis or White Town, where all
the wealthier class of people live. The former is
built of small huts made of brandies and plastered
on the outside with clay; they generally had some
trees planted round them ; and a tame parrot which
is the children’s playfellow. Some parrots are so
tame, that they are let loose. I asked two or three
of the people if they would part with their birds,
but they would not on any account, though I offered
one man ten shillings, which is thought a good


deal there; for the most that they can earn is from
three to five dollars a month, which is equivalent to
fifteen and twenty-five shillings.
The children in Black Town mostly go about
naked, but all the men and women wear clothes, and
the women particularly are very fond of any gaudy
clothing. As I passed along one of the streets, I
saw a barber’s shop, which consisted of four poles
stuck in the ground and a mat at the top ; and his
instruments consisted of a thing like a dagger, a tuft
of hair cut off the head of a customer, and a glass
bottle broken in half, filled with a filthy black
mixture (something like what Neptune’s barber uses
on crossing the line), to serve instead of soap-suds,
with which he scrubbed away at the faces of his
customers, and then scraped it off with the curious
razor. I rubbed my smooth chin, and felt happy
that I did not require his services.
The white part of the town was rather pleasant,
with a few nice French shops in it. Some China-
men had some shops there where they sold every-
thing, and most likely cheated as usual. They had
a square board behind the counter, where they used
to sit, and anything you wished to buy, that they
could not reach without getting up, they told you
with a grin that you must go without.
The markets were the most busy places in the
town. There was a fat Frenchman walking up and
down with a poor Malay behind him, and making a
great to-do when they asked too much, as indeed
they all did. When you go through the Bazaar you
find yourself seized by some half-dozen tradesmen,


who tell you that they are your black brothers, and
how much handsomer you look than when they saw
you last, &c. &c.; and stuffing your pockets with
scent and all kinds of things for presents, as I
thought; but as I was quietly walking out of the
Bazaar thinking how kind they were, a lot of them
came to me and asked me to pay them; and when I
asked them “ what for,” they said that I had bought
different things of them ; so I immediately emptied
my pockets, and then they had a grand squabbling
for whose was who’s things; so that they got
nothing from me by that trick.
I bought a lot of birds here, and they were very
beautiful, though very small; but on our passage
somebody let loose the best of them, and the small
ones either get starved or died from change of
climate ; for the sailor who was taking care of them
for me neglected them, so that long before we reached
England, they were all strayed, stolen, or destroyed.
I lost numberless little articles, among which was
a very curious silver coin given to me by papa
the last day when he had to go on shore from
the steamer, and pots of jam, fruit, eggs, &c. &c.;
which also disappeared in a very marvellous
manner.
One day I went along with three other boys for a
sail on the bay, and we landed at a cemetery. At
first we thought that it was some gentleman’s gar-
den, as over the high walls you could see trees
covered with fruit of different kinds, and sugar-
cane, and cocoa-nuts growing in great luxuriance.
There were two gates, and at each gate was a lodge,


in which lived two or three people, whose sole duty
was to keep the trees, plants, walks, and graves in
order, and to see that nobody stole the fruit, &c.
After giving one of the men a sou or two he allowed
us to walk through it. On every grave was a cup,
jug, or vase, in which the relations of the deceased
put a fresh nosegay. On all the graves there is a
crucifix, and on one there was an image of our Sa-
viour nailed to the cross. There was the tomb of
one of the governors with a long inscription on it;
it was very handsome, and something like Dr. Hob-
son’s in the old cemetery at Melbourne.
After coming out of the cemetery we went along
a path into a grove of cocoa-nut trees and came to
a hut, and I asked the man who came out, if he
would let us have some cocoa-nuts; but he said
that they were his master’s, and he would not sell
them. It was to this man that I offered ten shillings
for his parrot, but he smoothed it down with his
hand and said, that he would not part with it.
The people who possess cocoa-nut trees cut off
the small twigs, and then tie a bottle or tin can on
to the end, into which exudes the juice, which is
called cocoa-nut wine, and they sell it at the road-
side ; when I tasted it, it nearly made me sick, but
the people seemed to enjoy it very much.
All the washerwomen here are English; they
hire the native women, who wash your clothes by
dashing them between two stones, and mangle them
pretty well into the bargain,—so I would not send
my clothes.
There are some very curious fish at the Mauritius,


one kind is quite red, and the other blue, and the
people skin them before they cook them, and all the
scales come off with the skin. The people seemed
to be great fishermen ; for, tied to the buoys that
marked the passage in, there were generally two or
three canoes full of people fishing. A canoe is
made out of the trunk of a single tree. There was
a ship in the harbour, full of donkeys, which are
very cheap there at times, some of which were per-
fectly white; it was very amusing to see them
hoisted out by twos and threes at a time, and one
load went clean into the sea, but they were soon
hauled out. While we were at St. Louis, the
Queen’s birthday came round; and there was a
great firing of guns, and those on shore were an-
swered by a French frigate that was in the bay at
the time; and there was a review on a small plain
called the Champ de Mars, arid all the soldiers
marched through the town, and the artillery brought
their guns down to a square by the water’s edge,
where we always landed from the steamer. The
soldiers on shore fired the royal salute, and then the
Frenchmen replied; and, taking it altogether, it
was a pretty sight.
Some of the passengers went to see the tomb of
Paul and Virginia, the hero and heroine of the
Mauritius.
After having made a stay of three days, we
started again on the 25th of June, 1855, bound for
the Cape of Good Hope, and had to go through
that very disagreeable thing, sea-sickness again ; but
after the first day or two we recovered, and began


to play at draughts, chess, backgammon, and shuffle-
board, with great vigour, as they were almost the
only things you could do, except reading. One
night, I and two or three others who were on deck
smelt a great smell of burning, and on looking down
into the saloon, we found it full of smoke, though
the passengers were sitting down as usual; so some
of the gentlemen told them of the smoke, and then
there was a great confusion, and the ladies screamed
as usual, and some of them fainted, and the car-
penter got the donkey engine which was worked by
steam all ready; but the cause of all this alarm was
found to be, that there was no globe to one of the
lamps in one of the saloon cabins in which the port-
hole was open, and the wind blowing through had
blown the flame against a damp towel, which had
set fire to a hassock composed of shavings, that had
smouldered and made all the smoke ; so that happily
the engines were not wanted. Nothing of any con-
sequence happened after this till our arrival at the
Cape, except a very curious current that we passed
through; it was about one hundred feet wide (at
least so it seemed to me), and extended as far as
the eye could reach on either side, and when we
had passed it about half-a-mile, it looked just like
an immense belt of foam, for the wind was blowing
hard against it.
We saw Cape Lagullas, the most southern part of
all Africa, as we were going round the coast; and
certainly it did not look very promising, as it seemed
to us to be a dreary, barren rock. But when we
entered Table Bay, there were two or three nice


little villages to be seen by the help of the telescope,
among which was Wineburg on the road to the
famous Constantia, where the Constantia wine is
made. Table Bay is not much sheltered, and some-
times it is very rough there, and a good many ships
have dragged their anchors and gone on shore, and
I believe that in one instance there were a great
many lives lost; but there is a bay about five miles
off called Symonds’ Bay, which is perfectly shel-
tered and safe, and a good many ships go in there
in preference to Table Bay.
When we were hardly anchored, a number of
large boats (something like the English pilot-boats)
came racing alongside, and nearly all of them ran
into one another, and then ran into us, and nearly
stove in the best life-boat; so the captain put a man
on the bulwarks with a large bar of iron, and
threatened to sink some of them if they did it
again, so they came more cautiously alongside after-
wards. At first they asked a great deal for a
passage on shore, but afterwards they were more
reasonable. We were very much amused by a fat
Dutchman, who could not bring his boat alongside,
as he had broken his bowsprit off in the melee , but
was shouting out to the passengers all the time,
that his was the best boat among them. At last
he got alongside, and as he promised me a free
passage on shore, I jumped in, and as there was no
room in the other boats, his boat soon got filled,
and we got on shore at last.
The first thing we saw after we landed, was a
large church which they were repairing ; and very


nearly opposite was a shop called the “ old curiosity
shop,” where they sell all the curiosities of the coun-
try ; some enormous lion skins are in front of the
shop, and some very large horns of different kinds,
—such as Cape Buffalo, Gemsbok, Springbok, Oryx,
&c.; and also of a tiny little Antelope, which has
horns about the length of your little finger. Hung
all round the shop, you might see Ostrich eggs of
every size, and some of them you would see in the
window cut into ornamental baskets, cups, &c.;
there were also some very fine Rhinoceros horns,
out of which they cut riding-whips, walking-sticks,
ramrods, and other little things.
There is a fine cathedral here, called St. Mark’s,
which is well worth going to see; and some of the
passengers who heard it said that the music was
very good. I saw two Hottentots drive a bullock-
dray, in which I counted sixteen bullocks, into the
market; but I was told that that was no uncommon
number.
The people here have rather a curious custom of
selling everything, however small, by auction; and
for this purpose there is an auctioneer who goes
round to all the stalls in the market in their turns
and sells the goods. It was now about half-past
two, and the table-cloth was settling on Table
Mountain, which hides all the top of it; and all
the time that I was there it used to come over two
curious hills—one called the Lion’s Head, and the
other the Lion’s Rump, which were very like a
lion couchant. As it was getting rather late, I
went on board with a few curiosities that I had


bought, consisting of a Kaffir basket, an ostrich-
egg basket, and a pair of land-tortoise shells, to
which I afterwards added a bundle of porcupine
quills, a pair of ostrich egg-cups and a pair of
springbok horns. When I got to the ship I found
it smothered in coal-dust, so I went down and got
my railway-rug and slept on deck, which I had
to continue during all the time that we were at
the Cape.
The next day I went on shore with the Doctor,
and we took a couple of horses for the day and set
out to pay a visit to Constantia. The road runs
through Wineburg, in which some of the houses of
the early Dutch settlers still remain. We passed
by a famous nursery-garden ; so, as the Doctor
wanted some specimens of the different kinds of
flowers, we went in and saw some very beautiful
flowers, particularly a scarlet cactus in bloom,
which was very large and handsome: well, we
went on, and at last came to a board on which was
pointed out the way to “ Groot Constantia,” —so
called to distinguish it from another Constantia,
which has recently been planted. We were not
there at the time when the grapes were ripe, but
the oranges were, for which you paid about six-
pence a hundred; and I was told that other fruits
in their season were equally cheap. After having
drunk a glass of Constantia, where it is made, we
started off for Cape Town, and on our road, had
dinner at an inn in Wineburg. I just got into
town in time to take a short walk and then to go
on board; so, after paying a visit to the curiosity-


shop, I went down to the pier, and, at first, none
of the boatmen would take me off to the steamer
under half-a-sovereign, but at last one of the boat-
men, having another passenger, took me off for
half-a-crown. As it was very rough, and the
waves came rushing into the boat two or three
times, we got very wet; but after knocking about
for about half-an-hour, we got alongside.
The next morning we saw two penguins close to
the ship; but I do not think that they had the
different-coloured feathers that some have, and of
which some were being sold alongside. We had
arrived at the Cape on the 6th July, 1855, and,
after a stay of three days, we started on the 9th, on
our way to St. Helena. During the voyage nothing
of any consequence happened except the occasional
breaking of connecting-rods, which belong to the
paddle-wheel, as those which had been provided
were not sufficiently strong. We had some nasty,
disagreeable weather, just before we reached St.
Helena, and it was very cold. At last we saw the
island, which was just like an immense rock as it
gradually appeared. As near as I can remember it
was about six o’clock in the evening when we an-
chored, and the only thing that we saw distinctly
was the hull of a captured slaver, which had been
taken by a British cruiser some time before, and
though dismantled of masts, sails, &c., she still
looked the very model of a clipper.
The next morning we all got on shore, and went
for a walk through the curious little town, and then
some of us went up to see a fort, to reach which


you had to ascend a kind of ladder which had 656
steps in it, each about a foot apart, and which is
quite a journey to the top. When we had got up,
a very civil man asked us whether we would like
to go over the fort; so we went, and among other
things saw some enormous cannon, into which a
man could almost crawl; we also saw a very curious
telescope, with which the signalman said that he
could sometimes see vessels 69 miles out at sea.
Among some prints in the print-shop, I saw a view
of the immense wave which had risen at the mouth
of the harbour, and carried all the ships, slavers, &c.
on shore with it, on to the rocks beneath the fort
before mentioned. As you scramble round the
rocks you might see anchors, pieces of masts, tim-
bers, &c., half imbedded in the rock, which seemed
like lava. In the distance behind the town you see
Longwood, the residence of Napoleon during his
exile, and it looked a very pleasant place. On some
of the cliffs there were very large cannon, and
really you might wonder how ever they could get
them up such steep rugged-looking places; but up
one that I saw there was an iron tram-way with a
windlass at the top, so that they could haul cannon,
provisions, &c., up with very little trouble com-
paratively speaking.
There is also a fine fort on the left-hand side of
the town, under which there is a kind of cave into
which the boats go, and then the different things
are hoisted up by a pulley.
Circumstances prevented me going to see Na-
poleon’s tomb, but some of the passengers went, and


brought away bits of stone, earth, and willow, and
other things as relics; and they said that there was
quite a hole where the grave was, for people had
taken away stones and earth as relics.
There was a very fine Dutch man-of-war in the
harbour, and the number of Dutch ships passing in
and out of the harbour was almost incredible; and
they were constantly appearing and disappearing
round the two sides of the island. We did not stay
at St. Helena very long, as we coaled rather faster
than usual. We arrived on the 16th of July, 1855,
and after a stay of three days started on our way
to St. Vincent’s, Cape de Verde Islands.
As we approached St. Vincent, we saw some
wild goats (of which there are a good number in
the island) among the rocks. At last we got into
the bay, but we could not see anything but a
steamer in the harbour, as it was so dark. One of
the passengers persuaded me (as he had been there
before) that it was such a beautiful place ; so of
course, I scrambled up in the morning to see what
it looked like, but I was very much disappointed
when I saw the barren country and miserable
attempt at a town, which consisted of a few wooden
cottages without the slightest appearance of any
gardens, fruit, or anything in the way of vegeta-
tion, except two aloes, which they were trying to
make grow in front of the Governor’s house, but
even these seemed to be in a bad way.
As there were no passenger-boats, we had to
use the steamer’s boats to go on shore with. As
we were very thirsty, we thought we might as well


go and have a bottle of lemonade (all the lemonade
in tropical countries is in champagne bottles)
among us; so we went into the only shop in the
village and found that it was very dear, and after
we had opened it, quite undrinkable; but the man
drank it up, and I dare say he thought it a great
treat, as the people have sometimes to leave the
island and go to San Antonio, which is just oppo-
site, on account of the famine. San Antonio looks
(from St. Vincent’s) just like a large cloud, it is so
lofty : indeed, I thought that it was one when I
first saw it. I was told the Governor here receives
only 80 1. a-year. There is a little fort here which
mounts two or three guns, and two or three dozen
soldiers who do nothing but lounge about the
village and keep guard, which is rather tedious on
account of the burning sun. I picked up some
pretty little shells here on the beach, and that with
bathing, walking, and chasing wild goats, were the
only amusements here. There is a remarkable
mountain here called “ Washington’s Head,” which
is just like an enormous giant’s head, and they said
it was like Washington. There had been a steamer
here waiting for three months, having broken her
paddle-wheel and then lost it at sea, she was
on her way to Lisbon via Madeira; and as she
started two or three days before us ; we were all
very anxious to be off both to leave such a dis-
agreeable place, and to try and beat the other
steamer. We arrived here on the 30th July, 1855,
and started for Madeira, after a stay of two days.
Some of the passengers who were up early one


morning thought that they could distinguish the
Peak of Teneriffe, but the captain thought that
they must have been mistaken. We saw a great
number of flying-fish as we sighted Madeira, which
was about ten o’clock in the morning of the sth of
August. Ido not think that there could be two
more different places than St. Vincent’s and Madeira.
As we anchored, to the left of us was a curious
fort, built upon a rock rising almost perpendicularly
out of the sea: straight in front of us was the town,
and higher up the splendid hill, at the foot of which
the town is built, and to the left, a pretty little village,
which looks from a distance as if it was built in a
niche in the rock. We were soon surrounded with
bum-boats of all descriptions, some containing birds
particularly canaries; others, work done by the
nuns; others, feather-flowers and other things; but
those who sold their goods the fastest were the
fruiterers —as the fruit was very nice, particularly
cherries, pears, and strawberries. The town is
very curiously built, and the streets are not mac-
adamised, but have little round flint-stones driven
in all over them. The people here do not use car-
riages, but sledges drawn by oxen, which go pretty
fast. The place tailed the Parade is very pretty,
having nice gravel walks, and trees planted all
over it. The beggars here are very disgusting to
strangers—showing all sorts of sores to get a few
pence.
The convent and cathedral are very fine, but I
did not go over either, as there was no time, but I
saw the priests and their attendants in a procession


at the door of the cathedral. The passengers all
crowded to a house in a corner of the Parade, for
the luxury of a strawberry-ice and a glass of real
Madeira. We were told that most likely there
would be no more Madeira wine made, except of an
inferior class, because of a blight which has injured
the vines. There was an American man-of-war in
the harbour, and her sailors were riding about,
quite tipsy, all the time we were there; they were
all fine-looking men.
The dresses of the mountain-peasants and peasant
girls are very picturesque, as I saw two of them
riding into market on donkeys. There seem to be a
great number of carpenters here (who manufacture
pretty little desks, work-boxes, rulers, paper-cutters,
&c.); into which they put specimens of all the woods
grown in Madeira, and which are made something
in the same manner as Tunbridge ware.
I was told that the nuns make a great deal by
the manufacture of feather-flowers, and a kind of
lace-work, in both of which they excel. The pri-
soners in the jail make a great number of the infe-
rior kind of feather-flowers, as they are allowed to
work at their trades, and sell the things through
the iron gratings which look out upon the street,
but I believe that they have to pay a part of their
earnings to the jail.
The way of landing here is very curious, as there
is always a heavy surf running on shore; when
you get near, a lot of men rush in, and with the help
of the waves land the boat, high and dry, on shore,
stern foremost; and if the boat is too heavy for the


men, they make the gentlemen jump out, and then
carry the boat with the ladies on to the dry shingles.
The people here will take any kind of old rags
for their wares, and you could get a dozen work-
baskets which packed one inside the other, for an
old shirt. There were numbers of canary birds in
very elegant cages, made of a peculiar kind of reed,
being sold alongside, and bulfinches which had been
taught tricks, some of which were very amusing;
one of them would lie down on its seed-box and
pretend to be dead, and open the lid, and do many
other things when it was told; and all the bulfinches,
and some of the canaries, hauled their food and
drink out of little wells with windlasses and buckets;
and the little chains to the buckets were quite a
foot long. The steamer from St. Vincent’s had not
arrived when we left.
I obtained a good many curiosities while I was
here, such as baskets, a workbox, paper-cutters, and
a number of feather-flowers. The captain bought
a fine young bullock here, so we had fresh beef
for a good while during the rest of the passage to
England.
There was a place at Madeira which they showed
us, where a beautiful house, belonging to an
Englishman, had slipped with a large piece of land
into the sea. The garrison here are Portuguese,
and none of them are large men, being on an aver-
age from five foot six to eight inches high.
On leaving Funchal (the capital town of Ma-
deira), on our way to Plymouth, we passed all the
rocky coast of Madeira, and by some barren islands


called the Desertas, where there is a rock called
the Needle Rock, which rises perpendicularly out
of the sea, to about the height of the Monument in
London.
As we were now nearing England, there were,
as is usually the case, a great many raffles, lotteries,
and bets as to the time when we should anchor in
England. We began to see a great number of
ships as we passed by the straits of Gibraltar, and
we caught glimpses of the coast of Portugal all the
way up, and once with a telescope could see the
fields and a village quite plainly.
At last we arrived at Plymouth, and as we only
stayed there two or three hours, I have not much
to say about it, but that I went ashore and won-
dered at the narrowness of the streets, and the
quantity of merchandise hurrying all about, and
admired the Breakwater.
After taking in a few fresh provisions, and land-
ing passengers who wished to proceed to London
by rail, we steamed up the Channel and the
Thames, and the gentleman to whom I was con-
signed came on board at Millwall, where we were
fast on a mud-bank off Plough-wharf. I landed in
London, where I met with very kind friends indeed,
who took care of me, as I was not able to go to
school, from the 10th of August, 1855, till the
arrival of mamma, with my brothers and sisters, on
the 21st of April, 1856.
