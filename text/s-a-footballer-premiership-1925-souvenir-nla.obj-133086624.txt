The S. A.
TORRENS SURPRISE PORTS
Superior Dash Brings Victory
To-day’s Great Battle!
“The Wizard.”
THE League got a splendid at-
tendance of 35,000 spectators
for the second semi final be-
tween Ports and West Tonens.
Although the number pales into in-
significance beside the 60,065 people
who passed through the turnstiles at
the Melbourne Cricket Ground last
Saturday to watch the struggle be-
tween Essendon and Collingwood.
The day was almost ideal for foot-
ball. The ground was certainly a
trifle soft and slippery, but it had
dried up wonderfully under the influ-
ence of the sun and wind, and the
breeze, although fairly strong at
times, was not sufficient to interfere
with the plajr. Ports were the favor-
ites and their supporters would not
hear of defeat. True they were with-
out the services of Galliford, who had
been ordered by the League Commis-
sioner to stand down for three
matches, and their follower, Hoff-
man, was unable to take the field
owing to illness, but their opponents
were in just as bad a plight as O’Mal-
ley and Adams had also incurred the
displeasure of the Commissioners and
were compulsory absentees. But once
again the favorites suffered defeat.
Torrens were quietly confident. They
had been training hard and well and
were carefully coached, and before
the game was over they showed that
their self denial and attention had
borne fruit. The game was won and
lost in the first quarter. After a de-
sultory opening the Blue and Golds
suddenly became galvanised into life.
Brown at the centre, started the dash
and the players, following his axample,
led to the ball all over the field. Their
superiority in the general play was not
thrown away, . owing to some smart
snapshooting by O’Grady up forward,
and excellent work by Reid, a new-
comer in the half forward lines. Rush
after rush was successful and for a
time the Magpies were nonplussed.
They fumbled the ball badly and
failed to pass with either direction or
object. With Mills getting the knock
out, Karney roving with dash, Brown
beating Allingham in the centre, and
Fleet and McCarthy backing him up
well on the wings, the Blue and Golds
were undoubtedly the masters of their
opponents, and at quarter time the
board read, Torrens 4.4, Ports 1.2.
With the wind behind them in the se-
cond term and Adams and Bampton
battling hard, the Magpies made up
some of their leeway, but they were
still playing much below form and did
not look like winning. Their oppo-
nents were almost invariably first on
PRICE SIXPENCE.

to the ball and frequently caught the
Magpies out of their places. Brown’s
centre work and O’Grady’s roving
were features of the game and at half
time Ports were still behind the scores
being—Torrens 5.5, Port 3.7. On
these tallies it was still anyone’s
game, but whereas the Seasiders were
playing poor football, the Blue and
Golds were making fewer mistakes and
exhibiting greater dash and cohesion.
Realising that matters were becoming
desperate Ports started in with a will
immediately after the long interval. A
free to Keal bringing a welcome goal.
Brown, who had injured a leg at this
stage, went up forward, Karney taking
his skipper’s position at centre, but
still Torrens held sway. Keal realis-
ing that his defence was becoming dis-
organised brought Bampton in to his
old place in the half back line and the
advantage gained by the move was
quickly apparent. Logan, who had
been closely watched, suddenly woke
up two clever snaps, each bringing the
maximum, and at three quarter time
the Black and Whites led by a simple
point, the scores being—Port 7.9, Tor-
rens 7.8. The Port supporters were
now full of confidence. The Dayman
brothers were bringing down some
of their famous high marks, and the
whole team seemed inspired by their
example. When the side dashed away
at the bounce it looked as though their
hopes were justified. C. Dayman had
a try but kicked out of bounds and
then Fitzgerald only managed a point
from an easy try. This was the end
of Ports. Their centre man, Ailing-
ham, in flying for the ball came down,
twisting an ankle, and was useless for
the rest of the game. Keal at once
took his place, but from this point
Torrens gradually forced their way to
victory. Broderick, taking mark after
mark in the half back line, easily beat
back the Magpies attacks, and after
three points had been added it was fit-
tingly left to O’Grady to put the
finishing touch with a goal, the final
scores being—Torrens 8.12, Ports 7.11.
The Umpiring.
Quinn kept a firm control of the
game and his decisions w r ere quick and
impartial. He, however, did not in
my opinion reach the high standard
which he set in the match between
Norwood and Sturt, and he made
more mistakes.
Will Torrens Win?
Now for to-day’s great struggle be-
tween Norwood and Torrens. Should
the former win it will mean the end of
the season, but should they suffer de-
feat there will be another match with
an epic contest for the public to wit-
ness. That the Red and Blues will
win is the general opinion, but I am
not so sure that it will be the easy
thing for the Easterners that many
people expect. True Ports were below
form last Saturday, but it must not be
forgotten that Torrens were upset by
the loss of Adams and O’Malley. The
team as a whole played quick, dash-
ing football, pounced on the ball like
lightning, and passed better than
Norwood has done in any game this
season. The two problems which they
wall have to solve will be to stop Till
and Bent and overcome the and
Blue’s strength in the air. The first
of these will be a knotty point to solve.
Brown has several useful solid men
who can shadow Norwood’s elusive
forward, but who will stop Till?
Brown tried it himself without success
at Norwood, and Mills was equalty in-
effective. It has been suggested that
Karney might do the trick but 1 do
not think he is strong enough in the
air. It occurs to me that the man for
the job, if he can be spared from the
ruck is Lock. He is a solid, dashing-
player, can bump hard, and is good in
the air. If I were Brown I should be
inclined to try the experiment. It
must not be forgotten that the Nor-
wood team is in great heart and con-
tains many champions. The players
will go into the play with the com-
fortable feeling that even if defeated
they have another chance, a feeling
which may lead to less anxiety and
more effectiveness on their part! All
things considered I expect, given fine
weather, to see a great game, and if
the final bell leaves Norwood Premiers
for 1925, the honor will be well won
and well deserved.

NORWOODS, although they have
not displayed their dashing
form of 1933, are undoubtedly a
force to be reckoned with; they still
exhibit the dash to the ball and the
fighting spirit and courage which has
on so many occasions carried the Red
and Blue colours to victory. The side,
as-a whole, has learned how to bump
a man without putting hands on him,
and though the players have made
rather a fetish of the system it is
nevertheless a valuable qualify to
possess. White still leads the side,
and if his football is not what is was
he has lost none of his skill as a skip-
per. Bent, when in the mood, is still
a match-winner; whether placed for-
ward or roving, and W. Scott is still
the king-pin of the defence lines. By
reason of Dili’s fine high marking and
long kicking the central position is in
good hands, and his play won him the
Magarey Medal this year. While
Symond’s brilliant and dashing foot-
ball on the wing has great strength
to the team on the flanks. The weak-
est department is. in the ruck. Potts
is- not the footballer he was, while
Wadham, Westley, and Plunkett are
not brilliant, but the new rules have
obviated the need for ruckmen to a
great extent, and the Red and Blues
are fortunate that it is so. Schumaker
did most of the roving work, and al-
though he has received more than his
fair share of injuries he has stuck
gamely to his task—till he is now
probably at the top of his form. The
team is playing its best football at the
right end of the season, and will be a
hard nut for Torrens to crack- —the
side will doubtless play with plenty
of dash, but the one department where
the Red and Blues may fail is in their
passing—an art at which their op-
ponents are adepts. But should Nor-
wood lose to-day, they have the tre-
mendous advantage of another chance,
and it will take a very strong side to
beat them twice. As usual the affairs
of the Club were well looked after.
As I have said, White has lost
none of his skill as a skipper.
Mr. W. Cope was an energetic,
painstaking and courteous Secre-
tary, and with Mr. E. H. Tassie,
tcrests on that body. Mr. J. H. Gosse,
as President and Chairman of the
Committee, always took the keenest
interest in the welfare of the Club,
and he will be a pleased man if the
Red and Blues once again succeed in
winning the premiership—and their
chances of doing so are certainly very
rosy.


PORT ADELAIDE FOOTBALL CLUB

Premiers eight times (six times since the inception of League Football).

PORTS have had a good season;
they were not quite brilliant
enough to win the premiership,
but they were not far behind the best
of them. At times they showed
flashes of brilliant football, but a cer-
tain lack of cohesion, one probably to
inexperience, lost them top honours.
The side’s mainstay has undoubtedly
been L. C. Dayman, whose high-mark-
itlg was a revelation, and it was ex-
ceedingly unfortunate for the Magpies
that he was unable to take part in the
struggle against Norwood, on the re-
sult of which depended the destina-
tion of minor premiership. His bro-
ther Clem was good in patches, and
his form at half-forward was brilliant
at times. Peter Bampton had a won-
derful season; he played fast, dashing
football, and so good was his form
that he tied with Lill for the Magarey
Medal. Allingham, Hodge, and Bils-
borrow were a strong centre line.
Hodge is a junior who has the mak-
ings of a champion. He is light but
fast, and plays clever, brainy football.
Other juniors who promise well are
Logan and Fitzgerald; the former
has come to the front with tremen-
dous rapidity. He scored 54 goals in
the first round, and was second on the
list of League goalkickers. Fitz-
gerald, in my opinion, is one of the
coming champions; he plays with an^
amount of dash, handles the ball well,
and whether roving or forward is a
hard man to beat. Dewar has kept
goals splendidly, and his kicking in
both as regards length and reliability
was probably the best of any goal-
keeper in League football. Hoffman
gave L. C. Dayman great assistance
in the ruck. He plays solid football,
and gives promise of even better
things to come. Keal kept his side
well together, and made a capable
skipper. As usual the two
“Macs,” Mr. C. McArthur, the
popular Chairman of Committee, and
Mr. A. McKelvie, the energetic and
hard-working Secretary, have been
the very life and soul of the Club.
Nothing has been too much trouble
for them—they represent the Black
and Whites on the League, and in
every way have done their utmost for
the side. Mr. Skipper, as President,
has been of service to the Club in
many ways, and the officials and Com-
mittee have worked hard and success-
fully to keep things running
smoothly. They have rightly set their
faces against importations, and by en-
couraging the many juniors in the dis-
trict are developing the team on right
lines. Ports nearly succeeded in win-
ning the premiership this year; per-
haps next season they will realise
their ambition.

TORRENS so far have not had
such a successful season as they
had last year. The team started
off badly by suffering a defeat at
the hands of Glenelg in the very first
match of the year, and the seasiders’
first victory in League matches. The
new handball rule appeared to bother
the players for a long time; it was
the fast, quick flick of the ball which
carried the side to victory last year,
and not unnaturally with their strong-
est point frustrated by the new inter-
pretation the team was almost at sixes
and sevens for a while; in fact, it was
touch and go whether they would gain
a position in the four. But that it
would have been unfortunate had they
not done so was dearly proved by
their form against Ports last Satur-
day- they have trained hard and
been well coached, and are now right
at their top -with the result that des-
pite the fact that the team was weak-
ened by disqualifications by their su-
perior dash and combination they
fairly and squarely defeated the Ports,
and by their form showed that they
are the one side which has a chance
of overcoming Norwood. The team is
a remarkably even one. Brown has
been below form at centre, but sti
knows how to lead his men. Marvell
has got most of the goals, and had
remarkable success in some of the
games. O’Grady gained a place m
The inter-State side, and has generally
played fine football; he has certainly
done nothing better than his game
last Saturday. Mills has been patchy.
On this day his forward work was
brilliant, but at other times he failed
to hold the ball or to kick even pass-
ably well, Karney, Adams, Lock,
Osborn, Minear, Davies, and, in fact,
most of the side, have done good solid
work, and in P. Reid the powers that
be have unearthed a very promising
forward. The team is now playing its
best football, and even if Norwood
manage to beat them the Red and
Blues will have to be all out to win.
The Blue and Golds are fortunate in
their officials, the backbone of who is,
of course, the energetic and capable
Secretary, Mr. H. W. Tomkins, who
with his collegiate, Mr. J. Harley,
took hold of matters when things
were going rather badly, and the pre-
sent form of the side shows how suc-
cessful those efforts have been. The
speaker, Hon. J. Mclnnes, M.P., has,
as President, taken a great interest in
the teams’s doing, while a hard-work-
ing and capable Committee has, as
the result of its labors, pulled the
Club right to the front. The Blue and
Golds won their first premiership last
year, and will go very near to gaining
their second this season. And if they
do succeed not a little of the credit
will be due to Mr. Tomkin>s and Mr.
Harley.

THE Double Blues have once more
been near the top of the tree
without quite getting there.
They bad a wonderful opportunity of
doing so, as they had the game against
Norwood in the final round within
their grasp, but threw away a wonder-
ful opportunity. The side has played
some great games during the season,
and their system when in working
order was probably superior to that
of any League team, but the team, as
a whole, has had too many off days
to quite merit top honours. It was
unfortunate for the Club that Jackson
was unable to play at the start of the
season. Once he did take his place
he picked up his form immediately,
and as the result of his inter-State ex-
perience, which has been invaluable
to him, has developed into a first-class
forward. The chief reason for the
side’s failure to go top has been the
inability to unearth a centre-man to
take Vic. Richardsons place. Hutton
and Bullock were both tried out, but
though they played good football they
had no chance against men like Lill,
IticGregor, or Purler —the powers
that he will need to concentrate their
efforts towards filling the gap during
the recess. The team’s defence lines
were rugged and strong. Golding had
a wonderful year, and the older he
gets the better his judgment as a goal-
keeper seems to be. C. Scrutton was
a dashing and effective half-back, and
Beatty gave his captain great assist-
ance. Snowy Whitehead was a bundle
of energy in the ruck, and is one of
the best followers in the State to-day,
while Barron, G. Scrutton and Leak
all roved cleverly and effectively. The
first-named won his spurs in inter-
state football, and well justified his
inclusion, while G. Scrutton did splen-
did work up forward. S. Scrutton
was one of the State’s best wingmen
for the year. He handled the ball
well, and passed it out cleverly and
effectively to his forwards. The side
is undoubtedly a good one, and
should be well in the running next
year. With the old hands and the
many promising juniors which the big
district possesses the Double Blues
will always be a force to be reckoned
with. Mr.. J. K. Alderman, as Secre-
tary, has again guided the destinies of
the Club, and by his tact, courtesy
and hard work has kept things run-
ning smoothly. His genial colleague,
on the League, Mr, F. Fould, has
given him great and loyal assistance
and has been untiring in his efforts
for the Double Blues. Mr. E. R.
Brown, as President, has evinced the
livliest interest in the team and its do-
ings, while a hard-working and ener-
getic Committee, under the Chairman-
ship of Mr. Gould, has spent much
time and thought in attending to the
numerous matters which arise in the
course of a football season.


WEST ADELAIDE FOOTBALL CLUB
“The Wizard.”
SEVENTH in 1924
FIFTH in 1925
Premiers 4 times, Runners-up in 1922. Played 14, Won 7, Lost 7. Points for
889, Points against 877, Premiership points 14.
WEST. ADELAIDE very nearly
gained a place in the final four.
They are a good side, but a
fatal weakness up forward robbed
them of victory on many occasions.
They have not been without their
share of misfortune; the absence of
their crack rover, Bobby Barnes, be-
ing a severe blow to the team. In
McGregor they have a champion. He
has played in all positions—centre,
following, and half-forward—and he
has shone in them all. His high-
marking and long-kicking being a fea-
ture of his play. Harry Lee and Hux-
table have been the mainstays of the
defence lines. The former picked up
his best form, and towards the end
of the season was one of the best de-
fenders in the State, Huxtable played
his usual solid and dashing game; he
as a rare battler, who is never beaten.
I. Bishop has been a tricky and elu-
sive rover, who helped his side out of
many a tight corner and headed many
an attack. His one fault being a ten-
dency to hang on the ball too long.
The forwards have been weak right
through the season. W. Martin gen-
erally marks well, and worked hard
for his goals, but his kicking was
erratic, and he received little support.
The lack of sharpshooters alone has
kept the Red and Blacks out of the
four. The powers that be will no
doubt concentrate their energies dur-
ing the recess in seeking to overcome
the defect, and if they succeed the side
will be a well-balanced one, and will
take dny amount of beating next sea-
son. V. Peters, although his football
has fallen right off, handled his men
well. In the Hon. W. J. Denny, as
Patron, and Mr. C. Giffen, as Presi-
dent, the Club had, as two of its lead-
ing officials, supporters who took a
keen interest in its welfare. Mr. A.
Kenny was an untiring and indefati-
gable Secretary, and with Mr. Hains
as his co-delegate carefully safeguard-
ed the interests of the Red and Blacks
in the deliberations of the League.
Some new blood was infused into the
Committee at the start of the season,
and the members, with Mr. Hains as
Chairman, dealt effectively with all
the questions and details of manage-
ment which came before them for
their consideration. As I have said,
two or three good forward* will have
to be unearthed before the Club can
hope to improve its position. A solu-
tion of the difficulty might well be
formed in training up a. man to take
Bruce McGregor’s position at centre;
this would leave McGregor free to
play at centre-half-forward, and the
move should make a big difference to
the side, which only needs to im-
prove in this department to be the
. equal of the best of them.


NORTH ADELAIDE FOOTBALL CLUB
“The Wizard.”
SIXTH in 1924.
SIXTH in 1925.
Played 14, Won 6, Lost 8. Points for 949, Points against 981. Premiership
points 12.
Premiers, 4 times; Last occasion, 1921; Runners-up, 4 times.
ALTHOUGH North Adelaide did
not improve their position on
the League scoring sheet, they
can look forward to the future with
a certain amount of hope and confi-
dence. They improved out of all
knowledge during the latter part of
the season, winning their last three
matches against Torrens, Sturts, and
Glenelg, but they made their run too
late, the deciding factor against them
being two one-poinf defeats in suc-
cessive games against West Adelaide
and Norwod. At the start of the year
the play of the Red and Whites was
ragged and unconvincing. Their backs
were loose, their forwards weak, and
the whole side showed a lack of de-
cision and without any defined sys-
tem. When a man had possession of
the ball he appeared to be at a loss
to know what to do with it. But
gradually the team improved, and
their work in the air and dash and
pace makes them on present form the
equal of any League side. The princi-
pal improvement has been in the for-
ward ranks, where Munn has been
very successful. His high-marking
prowess enabled him to get the ball
for himself, and when he puts more
vigour into his work he should de-
velop into a champion. Morris has
had a great season in defence. He
made good in his first inter-State
game, and should have been per-
severed with. Conrad improved as the
season progressed. He was handi-
capped at the start by an injured
ankle, but at the finish his high mark-
ing was excellent. Dilliway is one of
the promising juniors of the side. He
plays a cool and effective game in de-
fence, and never fails to get his kick.
Lewis, although his judgment in leav-
ing his goal was at times at fault,
made a dashing full-back. Across the
centre Furler played brilliant football.
He handled the ball well, but needs to
improve in passing out to his for-
wards. Effick and Hargreaves are
two juniors who have made good.
The bulk of the ruck-work was done
by Townley, Moyle, and Lowe, all
good, solid workers and fine high
marks, while Kinnear and Thomas
made a pair of clever and capable
rovers, who, however, should both rid
themselves of the tendency to hang
on to the ball. A pleasing feature was
the success of the “B” team in win-
ning the premiership of “B” Grade,
and with the young members of the
“A” team coming on and many prom-
ising juniors to try out, the prospects
for next year are exceedingly bright.
They must learn to get rid of the ball
quicker, and to more advantage than
they do at present. A good coach will
soon teach them this, and when they
have learned these two lessons they
will, indeed, be a hard nut for any
side to crack. With Sir Lewis Cohen
and Mr. R. Lewis, as Patrons, and
Mr. C. L. jessop, as President, the
Club has lacked nothing in the
strength and interest of its leading
officials. Mr. Young has always been
a capable and courteous Secretary,
and he and his co-delegate, Mr. J. F,
Bennett, have been two of the
League’s strong men. The Com-
mittee, with Mr. Bennett as Chairman,
have -worked hard and untiringly in
the Club’s interest right through the
season.


SOUTH ADELAIDE FOOTBALL CLUB
“The Wizard.”
FIFTH in 1924.
SEVENTH in 1926.
Played 14, Won 4, Lost 10. Points for 883, Points against 1151, Premiership
points 8.
Record—Premiers, 8 times; last occasion, 1899; runners-up, 10 times.
SOUTH ADELAIDE had a bad
year. Season after season they
start out with high hopes, only
to see them dashed to the ground be-
fore the finals. It is now 36 years
since the Club held the position of
premiers, and all supporters of foot-
ball would be delighted to see the
Blue and Whites once more at the top
of the tree. They met with misfor-
tune when they lost their skipper,
Caust, and matters were not improved
by the unfortunate accident which
kept Aistrope who was playing excel-
lent football on the wing, out of the
side for the remainder of the season.
But in spite of these misfortunes one
cannot help feeling that the Blue and
Whites should have done better than
they did. They have two brilliant
footballers in men in A. J, Ryan and
Moriarty, Vickers and Daly played
fine football across the centre, and
their rucks and defence lines are rug-
ged and strong. Yet the team failed
in match after match. They could
never be taken lightly, and always
gave their opponents a hard fight,
but seldom succeeded in being ahead
at the finish. In my opinion the rea-
son is that the majority of their
players are too slow and heavy for
present-day football. Certainly a
team needs a sprinkling of big men
who can bump hard and do the heavy
slogging work but to succeed a side
must Contain a number of smart,
nippy players, whose work is full of
dash and fire, and who will smarten
up the whole eighteen. These men
South Adelaide lacked, and this factor
proved once more to be their undoing.
It has been the same with the Blue
and Whites for many years past, and
the officials should, during the recess,
devote their attention to the acquisi-
tion of smart juniors, who will liven
up the side which at present is rather
in the doldrums. The one bright spot
has been the wonderful success of
“Bulla” Ryan, who, in spite of his
Club’s lowly position, headed the list
of League goalkickers with the record
tally of 57 majors to his credit, all
earned as a result of brilliant football.
After many years in office Mr. J. F.
Dawes relinquished the position of
Honorary Secretary, and the pos4 was
capably filled by Mr. C. C. Ryan, who
with his co-delegate, Jsfr. J. Cooke,
efficiently represented the Club Blue
and Whites on the League. The
Club suffered a severe blow by the
loss of their esteemed Patron, Mr.
James Marshall, who always took a
keen interest in the players and their
doings. In Mr, S. J. Jacobs, Souths
have a President second to none, and
a hard-working Committee, with Mr.
Cooke as Chairman, has left no stone
unturned to improve the team’s posi-
tion and make things run swioothly.


GLENELG FOOTBALL CLUB
“The Wizard.’’
Position, eighth. Points for 797, Points against, 1249, Played 14, Won 2,
Lost 12. Premiership points 4,
ALTHOUGH Glenelg is once
more at the bottom of the list,
now that the Club has opened
its winning account there is no reason
whj-, the team should not be built up
to League standard. When the Tigers
succeeded in defeating last year’s
premiers, West Torrens, in the very
first match of the season there was
great rejoicing in the seaside camp,
and hopes were held by at least a
position in the final four, but unfortu-
nately expectations were not realised.
They followed up their victory by a
sterling fight against Port Adelaide at
Alberton, but gradually fell away after
that, and their only other victim for
the season proved to be South Ade-
laides. They put up some good fights,
but a lack of system and combined
effort and a deplorable weakness up
forward, which was largely due to an
injury to Owens, their crack goal-
kicker, proved to be their undoing.
The lack of any definite system can
be remedied by good solid coaching
anl hard training, and energy should
be devoted to seeing that the side gets
both these, and to the acquisition of
one or two reliable forwards. The
principal strength of the team has
been in the defence lines, where J.
Handby has had a wonderful year.
Time and again he has carried prac-
tically the whole of the defence work
on his own shoulders, and has come
through with flying colours, so much
so that he came very close to winning
the Magarey Medal. Lloyd is a
dashing and effective wingman, who
more, than held his own with his op-
ponents, and when given his chance
in inter-State games played brilliant
football. Hoft, Toms, Gotts, Samp-
son, Fuss, and Owens all played well
at times, and formed a good, solid
backbone to the side. It was un-
fortunate that the services of the last-
named were not available for many
games, owing to injury, and had he
been availabl right through the Tigers
might have won more matches than
they did. They certainly work under
certain disabilities, but hard work and
perseverance will overcome these,
and now that they have broken the
ice and have proved that they can win
matches there is no reason why they
should not climb further up the lad-
der. The Hon. H. Tassie, as Patron,
and Mr. Frank Smith, as President,
have as always taken a keen interest
in the doings of the Club, and have
supported it through thick and thin.
Mr. E. A. Rugless, as Secretary, has
worked as hard as any of the players
for the success of the team, and with
his co-delegate, Mr. Kappler has
done everything possible to win
success. The Committee, with Mr.
Mclntosh at their head, has also
worked untiringly in the interests of
the side, and it is to be hoped that be-
for long they will see the reward for
their labors —a reward which they
have certainly earned.

CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING

“RAPIER.”
AK44 Att us srs&rs
Wrestling Championship, so that this may be the last opportunity to see Sol
h.er B.Uy m action. Walter Miller is also off to the land of Stars and Stripes.
Monday night will prove whether or not a 12.7 man can successfully combat the marvel
ous.strength of .Burnt, ster who turns the scale at 14.4, and who claims that he is perhaps
he s congest living man Wrestling is an old Cornish sport, but the style of the older davs
is entirely diffeient to that practised by the modern wrestler. Meeske soon ascertained the
rue position when he went up against the champions from America. Russia and other Countries
who tried their skill and man craft in Melbourne last winter.
BILLY MEESKE.
t .w ly nu M if eske " as bo ™ S , outh Melbourne 35 years ago. He is still an ardent supporter
“ at Club . moreover he is the physical trainer. He began a wrestling career among the
amateurs, and included in that class who met defeat when contesting with him were Geo.
Beattie, Tom Tonkin, F. McDonald, A. Briggs, J. Fullingham, Embling, Jassund and Hard
wick. Jitrtblmg became Amateur Champion of Victoria. In all his bou’s, which numbered
67, no amateur had the satisfaction of throwing Meeske, much less defeat him for a trophy.
t had heard that Billy had laid claim to the title of champion all round athlete of Aus-
tralia and when he entered my den on Tuesday, I asked the Aussie wrestler to mention a
few of his sporting attributes quite apart from the “mat-world.” Billy said he held a motor
cycle paced record for one mile, the time being 1,29; had swum three miles in the river
Yarra; achived distinction as cross-country running ; contested the final round of the Victorian
Amateur Boxing Championship; excelled at Jiu Jitsu, Weight Lifting, Gymnastics, Acrobatics,
rootbali, and seveial o.her branches of sport. In nineteen profsstonal boxing contests he had
won eighteen, the other ending in a draw. 'That is ample evidence of Meeske’s all-round
prowess.
His first contst as a professional wrestler was in 1915, with Van Enden (a round the
world walker) at the Melbourne Stadium. When Meeske inlisted his services were in demand
as a physical instructor at the Royal Park Camp, and under his watchful care the physique
oi his charges improved considerably. When abroad he met and defeated many notable
wrestlers from other countries. Ralph Pacault, Parco, Ramons, Polk and Smith were all laid
on the mat in turn. The last named had won the £lOO prize for being the best developed
man in England. One of the most sensational bouts was the Meeske Ternin clash. The Aus-
tralian wrestled for a £l,OOO purse, which was. subscribed by his comrades in camp. The
match was decided in France and two falls in mins, were credited to the Aussie champion
The Frenchmen gesticulated wildly, but all for no purpose. Meeske’s share of the spoils was
£5OO. Since he returned from the war zone he has defeated McNardo (three times) Koosch
(3), Honroth (2), Tonkin, Smith, Bailey, and All Summi (Champion Wrestler of India)
SAM BURMISTER—STRONG MAN.
Sam Burmister borders on the hercules. He does those things quile easily which the
ordinary strong man would never dream of attempting. Who else would dare to stretch him-
self on the ground and allow boards to be placed on his inflated chest and be content to stay
there while two motor cars passed over him. The writer was shown photographs of this unique
happening. Another extraordinary feature of liurmister’s many risky, carefree tricks is to
engage a young bull in combat, not with the red rag and a dagger, but in a rough and ready
wrestling bout. This happened at Footscray recently. So confident is the wrestling champion
of the Orient that he “fears no foe.” Sam was born in Esthonia, near the Baltic Coast, and
he has wrestled in China, Japan, Russia, Germany, Poland, Norway, Finland, the Phillipiim
Islands, and in many other lands. It is therefore but natural that he is confidence personified.
To see him standing with his feet planted on the sward with a team of men on either
side palling and tugging, gives rise to the belief that nothing can hurt this wonderful man.
Five hundred people watched the two wrestlers give exhibitions at the Y.M.C.A. and at
Weber, Shorthose & Rice’s rooms during the early part of the week, and members of Tatt’9
Club were also afforded an opportunity to judge for themselves just how the great struggle
will end on Monday night at the Exhibition Hall.
Better be there, sir, for these bouts certainly thrilled Melbournian sportsmen.
