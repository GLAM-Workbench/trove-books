Commission,
The 'V. H. o. '•
Concrete House,
■rf
System used in
several of the
V. H, G. Housing
Estates (see
remarks below),
TYPE OP CONSTRUCTION
FOUNDATIONS
Precast concrete piers are set at predetermined
points to carry the floor and superstructure.
FLOORS
Construction is by usual methods.
WALLS
1 Walls of reinforced concrete 3" thick with greater
'thickness to form beams at top and bottom, and wltl
i off set to take floor construction, precast on larg«
j tables on which door and window frames, plates,
! vent holes, etc. are set prior to pouring.
Walls are reinforced and set as beams between the
pier supports.
When concrete is sot, table is rotated to bring
wall into vertical position. It is then carried
from slings by a mobile crane and placed in posit-
ion on piers. Wall sections are bolted together
at angles and joins.
ROOF
Roof construction in timber by the usual methods,
covered with tiles.
Ceiling of timber joists sheeted with fibrous
plaster.
ANY SPECIAL
FEATURES OP
DESIGN.
Walls are cement paint sprayed and are not
plastered internally or externally.
RESULTS OF TESTS
BY O.E.B.S. (IP
ANY).
-
INFORMATION
REGARDING COSTS.
Costs vary slightly but generally considered as
somewhat cheaper than brick construction. More
economical under mobile plant conditions to
construct a number of houses on adjoining sites.
A precastJLng depot for mass production is now
established.
REMARKS IN-
CLUDING PRESENT
STAGE OP PRQ-
GRBSS AND PRO-
DUCTION PLANS.
The Fowler Patent is wholly operated by the
Victorian Housing Commission and has been used in
the construction of projects on various Metropo-
litan estates, e.g. Newport, Oakleigh, Brunswick
and Fishermen’s Bend Estates,

V-shaped space between slabs provide, to some
degree, continuity of reinforcement.
RESULTS OP

Construction structurally stable and durable. Under
conditions of mass production, costs and time of
construction should be considerably less. Full

A contract has been let to McDonald & Greer by
the Housing Commission for the erection of one
experimental house at the price of £96 per
square. The contractors are at present con-
fident that they will be able to undertake
future contracts for the same price. It is
their intention to establish a factory and
secure equipment which will enable a rore
efficient manufacture and handling of slabs,
(A.P.O. f s September report). The first
experimental house is a?;aiting roofing material
and the walls of a second house have been
erected. It is anticipated that costs of
these houses will greatly exceed the contract
price of £96 per square, but contractors are
confident that improved equipment and certain
modifications will .reduce the cost to well
below £100 per square.

By the use of steel forms it is proposed to produce a
wall slab which will not require plastering internally
or rendering externally? but will take colour in each
case. All concrete will be electrically vibrated
which will give greater strength and density.

Messrs. Clements Langford are prepared, provided the
Government will find £20,000 for steel forms, to under-
take to build 500 houses per annum at the cost above-
mentioned, but they are not prepared to find the money
for steel forms as a speculation, as they consider the
present conditions of the building trade too uncertain
to justify such an outlay. (A.P.O. 's report dated
20/8/’46). (A.P. 0. 's minute 30/10/’46) The Commission

The Builder has not approached the Housing Comm-

(Prom abovementioned report). The-major
defects apparent in the houses erected at New-
port in 1944 have been largely overcome by the
latest modifications to the system as
demonstrated in the houses at Ormond and
Glenhuntly, Requiring smaller quantities of
timber and bricks, at present in short supply,
this form of construction presents certain
advantages over normal methods of building.

The sizes of slabs have not been very carefully con-

handled might be used. They should be more rigidly
fixed before pouring is commenced. If No-fines
concrete is used, external walls should be thicker.
Subject to improvements in the design of slabs, and

(O.E.B.S. Report No.314/1. October 1946) It is felt
that the general type of construction, with certain

simplicity of manufacture and design, its speed of

The house at Granville is completed. No information
as to plans for production (December 1946), In future
houses, the firm is proposing to adopt traditional
construction for floors and ceilings. In this case, the
thermal benefit of the concrete ceiling would dis-
appear and the bracing effect of the concreue floor
and ceiling would be lost. Difficulties would then
exist in making the walls comply with the requirements
iof the Station’s code.

Fmmd'-tions are constructed with piers at $ tt, centres or as’a continuous
foundation wall. Footings are laid with 12»* x 12« x V blocks, and piers
or foundation walls constructed with 9’ 1 x 9 W x If" blocks.
Floors are constructed with -
(a) Precast concrete bearers 5” x 2*.
?b) precast concrete joists if" x y" at 2if" centres.
(o) Precast concrete floor slabs 1; " thick, 12" wide and if 1 long.
The floor slabs are rendered on the upper surface after the floor is laid,.
ETERNAL WALLS.
External walls have if" x if" precast concrete studs spaced at 2J n centres
supported on 7" x 5" precast sills. The studs arc dowelled to the sills
at the bases and held in position at the head by if" x 2" timber plate,
the rods in the studs projecting through the plate with the ends turned
over.• The studs are sheeted on two sides with precast concrete slabs li"
thick, 12" wide and ip 6" long, the slabs being bedded on top of each other
and secured to the studs with cement mortar. As a preliminary-a nail is
driven into the stud to hold the slab in position. A stud is provided at
each side of door and window openings and there is no special lintel over
these.
BITERNAL
PARTITIONS.
Internal Partitions are built in the floor with precast slabs 2?- rt thick,
12" wide and 5’ 9” long. Every .alternate slab is bonded into the ,
external walls by inserting between two studs.

The Roof is framed in timber in the usual manner. The roof covering is
of precast concrete slabs j/8 n thick x 15" x A’ 0" laid from the eaves up
to - the ridge with a lap of JP a nd supported by timber battens. The slabs
are not nailed, but the lap is sealed with cement mortar, as are.the butt
joints at the ends of slabs. Ridges are covered with a shaped preoast
concrete ridge capping.
SPECIAL
FEATURES OP
DESIGN.
Extensive use of precast concrete units made up with ash or cinder
aggregates.
RESULTS OP
TESTS BY
C.E.B.S.
A number of existing houses have been inspected and these are all
cracked to a greater or less degree, only one being considered to be in a
really good condition. 'While some of the oraoks are undoubtedly due to
foundation movements, the same form of cracking is symptomatic throughout.'
The general standard of vrorkmanhhip appeared, with some exception, poor.
The almost universal cracking is considered to bo due to the use of
poor aggregates and unsatisfactory methods of manufacture and curing of
slabs,
iiue* to its dependance on joint details have shearing'
and tensile forces of some magnitude transferred through them, and which
are made with mortar having no meohanioal key, the system is not considered
entirely structurally sound and the Station cannot recommend it in its
present form.

The stability of the whol.. building is . shade doubt-
ful as no system of bracing appears to have been de-

being relied upon to a good extent for rigidity.,
(A.P.O's report on experiment; 1 house dated 5/I1/46).

Estimate an output of 100 a week when the organ-
isation is running at capacity. (14/1/1946),

(prices for the construction of further houses by
ithe firm too high, and nothing further has trans-
(pired in the matter. The experimental house at

expressed the view that unless some absolute
protection could be maintained against external
weather conditions, water reacting the plaster 'would
