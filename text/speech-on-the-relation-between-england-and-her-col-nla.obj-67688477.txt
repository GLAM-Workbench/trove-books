SPEECH.
Me. Mayoe, Ladies, akd Gektlembu,?l am here to-night to
present to Sergeant-Major Martini this silver cap, which I have given as
a prize for rifle shooting, and in doing honor to him who so well
deserves it, also to do honor to the corps to which he belongs, the Launceston
Artillery, that little band which, under my friend Captain Harrap, survived
the winter of neglect, and kept alive a spark of military feeling in Tasmania.
(Applause.) In promising this prize I said that I desired to encourage the
revival of the manly exercise of rifle shooting, in the hope that it might lead
to something more, to defence organisation, to the rise of that spirit which
should ever go hand in hand even in the smallest communities with political
rights, and I have not been disappointed.
Standing before you on an occasion like this, at a time
when the question of defence occupies all men?s thoughts, when your
statesmen are consulting, and your citizens coming forward to offer
their services, when every telegram from Europe comes throbbing
with hopes and fears for the peace of the world, and the honor and
welfare of our common country ; standing here now at such a time it
were wrong for me to be silent, or to leave untouched the many considera-
tions which so naturally arise out of the occasion which has called us together.
It is very seldom, and the subjects are very few, upon which a Governor can
wisely, or even constitutionally speak his mind, and I confess that
unless I can speak plainly out, I prefer a ?golden? silence even to that ? silver?
speech to which I lay no claim. You may ? hear me for my cause,?
for it is your?s and England?s, a subject which alike involves Imperial and
Colonial interests, and which is no party question. (Applause.) I will
therefore propose for your consideration some thoughts upon the relations
between England and her Colonies in reference to defence, and upon your
position, interests, and duties in that regard.
I have throughout my life held strong and decided opinions on these ques-
tions, and have acted upon them, as those, whether in New Zealand or
England who best know my career, best know, and as a Governor I have
ever steadily urged them. Briefly, it is, in my opinion, the duty of erery
loyal subject of the Queen, and indeed of every citizen of a free country, to


take his share, by head, by arm, by purse, or in whatever way his abilities,
his avocations, his bodily powers, and his circumstances may permit, in the
defence of his country. It is very well to talk of loyalty, lip loyalty is cheap,
this is the test we want of loyalty, and by this test, if I mistake not, we are
prepared to stand. Small indeed, poor indeed, few indeed, we are, when
compared to great and powerful communities; but we are not so small, so
poor, so few, as to be indifferent to ? all that doth become a man,? or to be
unable too to do it ; for we shall be measured, not only in our
own self-respect, but also in all fair minds by how far we do
our best with the means that are given to us, quietly, unostentatiously, and
in a business like manner. If we do this, and I trust that we shall, no
noble or generous mind will despise our efforts. Part of my youth was
spent in Switzerland, among a kindred race, whose institutions "to this day,
as the historian Freeman points out, are closely analagous to those of our
Saxon ancestors. It happened sometimes that I then heard ignorant and
vulgar sneers at their citizen soldiery, but I remembered that the stout
peasantry, townsmen, and gentry of little forest cantons far smaller, and
some of them scarce numbering a population larger than Tasmania, and
girt by no ? strip of silver sea,?? protected by no mother country, had,
shoulder to shoulder, maintained their independence and liberties for cen-
turies, sometimes against rival cantons, sometimes against a foreign enemy.
Boy as I was, my heart warmed to them, and now as a man my measure
of respect for a country is largely dependent upon the amount of readiness
shown by a people tocome forward and fulfil their duties, be they in peace or war.
Duties observe, I call them ; Nations have duties, Provinces or
Colonies have duties, Men have duties.
It is the duty of the mighty empire to which we belong to uphold her
position amongst the nations of the world, not from the mere vanity of lust
of glory or of empire, though pride in the glory of our country is
good as strengthening the state, but, because when a great and powerful
nation is in the full strength and vigor of its energies it cannot stand still, it
must either advance or decay, and because this great empire, whose off- shoots
gird round the world, has a high mission and a high destiny to which she
must be faithful or fall like Carthage, ?absit omenl? fall perhaps in a ruin of
which the world has hardly seen an example, if ever, for the Roman was
chiefly a military not also essentially a commercial, naval, and manufacturing
nation.


As to Colonies it is their duty to co-operate with the protection afforded
to them by the mother country to such extent, however small, as may be
commensurate with their means. It is their advantage as well as their duty,
as I shall hereafter show.
Men as individuals, moreover, owe protection to their families, and if
they have self-respect they must feel that nothing is more contemptible than a
community that will not raise a hand for the honor and safety of its wives
and daughters, that only cries for some one to protect it whilst it lives
in ease and makes money ; money, perhaps, after all, as bees make honey,
?Vos nonvohis, mellificatis apes? a spoil to the first strong hand. So it has
been before, so it may be again.
It may be objected that lam mainly appealing to sentiment. Men who
theoretically despise sentiment are usually and unconsciously moved by it,
and an ounce of true and honest intuitive spirit is often worth a cart-load of
balanced arguments. ? Enthusiasts they have called us,? retorted John
Eobert G-odley, ? when was anything great ever done without enthusiasm ??
(Applause.) But lam not going to rely upon sentiment, though when
sentiment is true, it is the mother of, and ever runs parallel with practical re*
suits. lam coming to argument; argue I may on this question, for it is no
party one in our Tasmanian politics; I think no one will think of taking
office on the basis of proposing to tax you to provide ways and means for
paying ransoms in the event of war. Our Opposition, ? Her Majesty?s
Opposition,? will, I doubt not, be true to their action when in office, and
loyally support the Crown and Ministers in a well considered, real and solid
scheme of defence, not as a spasmodic effort, but as a permanent and durable
scheme, to be one of the institutions of the country, capable of expansion in-
deed in time of danger, but for that very reason to be efficiently maintained
in time of peace.
I return then to the three heads that I have already laid down, Imperial,
Provincial, and Personal, and I will inquire next how far our interests coin-
cide with our duties.
And firstly, regarding our relations as an integral part of the empire.
We may be drawn into war by the connection ; and also, indeed, England
may be drawn into war to protect us; what do we gain in return ? It has
been held by some that we lose by this connection, and it has been, on the
other side, urged even more frequently that England loses by it. I have a
knowledge of Colonies and colonists extending over thirty years and colonists


never yet, to my knowledge, have been dragged into a war of which they dis-
approved. England will never seek war, and she can never go to war unless
public opinion is decidedly in favor of it as just and necessary. Englishmen
residing in colonies think very much as Englishmen residing in England do
on these questions. War does not suit them, but they are ready to accept
the state bf war rather than submit to national humiliation, or sacrifice na-
tional interests. (G-reat cheering.) I will go further, and I will say that
I should be surprised to learn that even native born colonists took anything
like the same interest in any possible local question, as they would in the
success of British arms in a war even waged at the, to them, other
end of the world. During part of the Crimean War I was in New
Zealand, and during part of it in England, and I believe that the
news of Alma and of Inkerman was received as enthusiastically in
Wellington or Otago as it was in York or Edinburgh, and so I
think it would be again here or in any other of the Colonies, Caelum
non animam mutant qui trans mare currunt ; And though this is not
the time or place for me to discuss questions which will solve themselves in
the future when they are ripe for solution, I do repudiate the idea that
colonists are to make up their minds that their children are to be members
of petty states without a past and without a future, instead of citizens of a
powerful empire rich in deeds of great price, with a glorious past, and, I
fondly trust, a yet more glorious future. (Loud cheers.) What do we gain by
the connection ? Not only that elevation and the breadth of view that it
gives, but the substantial, the very substantial benefit of immunity from
insult, plunder, annexation, or the alternative of a military and naval
expenditure disproportioned to the means of a young country. Have we ever
realised what it would be to lie at the mercy of a foreign state, or to be
governed, silenced, gagged, drilled, and disciplined at the will of a foreign
prefect ? Little do ordinary Englishmen know of systems which are not
theirs, how little thankful are we when we whine about evils which it rests
with ourselves to remedy. It is said that ? our weakness would be our
protection.? When was weakness protection ? Is nature changed ? Has
history no lesson ? Does the strong man always respect the weak ? I
Naboth?s vineyard ever safe from greed ? Does no wolf ever harm th S
lamb ? Alas ! even in this nineteenth century of the three R?s and science
primers, we have used the great advances of physical science, not only for
peaceful objects, Ijjt to make war more terrible. Millions and millions of


armed men, torn from peaceful avocations and from all family ties, confront
one another on the Continent of Europe, awaiting but the signal for slaugh-
ter. Look at the wars of the late years of this century, fire, rapine, outrage,
unheard of war imposts, and then tell me if you will that ?our weakness
will be our defence.? (Applause.) Of the numerous weak states that
existed in Europe at the commencement of this century, how many remain as
yet unabsorbed in despotisms, or in systems nominally free but which to
them, and to us, if we knew them, would seem intolerable? What saves
those which remain ? Simply the conflicting interests and jealousies of power-
ful neighbors, and their own patriotic sacrifices, sacrifices really dispropor-
tioned to their means; and we, situated as these Colonies are, in a position
where naval preponderance is all powerful, certainly cannot estimate too
highly the advantages of being protected by the might of the Queen of the
Seas. No power, however great, can with impunity insult the meanest set-
tlement or outrage the humblest British citizen of the smallest British Colony,
without being liable to be called to account by the greatest naval power in
the world. No hostile armament could attempt to attack or occupy the most
insignificant of our Colonies, without the almost certain prospect of being
anticipated by a more powerful British fleet, and the yet more certain one of
ultimate destruction. Can any man argue that this is no advantage for the
Colonies ? Politically, too, it is ray opinion that the connection is of very
great advantage. The system of Responsible Government under Governors
who represent the Crown, and who hold a balance between political parties?
as Lord Dufferin pointed out two years ago in a well-known speech?is a
means by which many complications and difficulties are avoided. Effect is
thereby given to the ultimate will of the country in a way the most quiet, the
most simple, the most effectual. Instead of a possible conflict between an
elected president and his officials with an elected legislature?lnstead
of the enforced submission of the popular will to that of their elected
chief for his term of office, and that of his officials, or the alternative of
threats, or riots, or revolution, you have a change of Ministers, and after
a mild excitement all settles down and everything goes on as smoothly
as possible. (Applause and laughter.) I have been a colonist myself, and
have spent my life in constant communication of the most intimate nature with
colonists, and I have never yet heard a colonist maintain that he would prefer
to live in a small republic and elect his own president for a term of years to
living under a representative of the Crown aud a free Constitution, I have


heard many colonists of late years decry Responsible Government, but were
that the general feeling of colonists, nothing prevents them from modifying
their own domestic institutions. (Applause.) For my own part, having
lived under as a colonist, and administered as a Governor, the three
various systems of Government that have succeeded each other in
these colonies, I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that I should
be very sorry to cast my lot under any other as yet tried but
Responsible Government, and I firmly believe that under no other
that I know of would these Colonies have made such progress, nor
have been so generally free from disturbing influences, nor have remained so
loyal as they are to the British Empire. Blots there are in all human insti-
tutions?wrongs even, but under Responsible Government the remedy is in
the hands of the country, and I have yet to learn that persevering ability,
joined with public spirit and high character, has sought and failed in these
Colonies to command respect and secure attention. I will not further re-
capitulate the material advantages to the Colonies of their connection with
England, the power, for instance, of reference for the highest political,
military, and legal advice or appeal. What do Colonies give up in return ?
Nothing that I know that they care to have.
But if lam asked what England gains ? I reply, the advantage of
being a growing power, instead of entering the path which might lead to
her becoming a waning one, for when the sap that invigorates the spray
and leaflets fails and decay sets in, branch after branch falls off, and the
bare trunk alone is left, shorn alike of beauty and of vigor. I might ex-
pand this reply under numerous heads, commercial extension, consequent
naval and military power, with growing population, and means to support it,
energies with objects and outlets to develop and support them, moral
influence, in international affairs which depends so largely on power, an
influence which no nation is likely so constantly to use in the interests of the
peace of mankind. Begin by giving up the Colonies, where will the
integrating process end ? To what lengths will your logic carry you ?
Why keep India, and next why not further reduce army, navy, and ? leave us
naked to our enemies ?? On the other hand it is certain that the Colonies
will be able in a few years more largely to add to the actual strength of
England, and then the question of relations between different parts of the
empire will assume a new phase, and will find its own solution. I hope, as
an Englishman, in a sense other than that of disintegration, and time and


prospects may draw closer the relations between all the peoples of our race
and language*; it should be our objects to make them do so, did we not.
I might almost say that we should be guilty of treason to onr race, nay,
more, considering its peaceful, free, and order-giving influences, of treason
to the interests of mankind. (Cheers.)
Now let me take you to what more personally and directly concerns ns, my
second point, the duties of a Colony as regards self-defence, and after what I
have said I may confine myself to our own case. lam asked, Will England
not defend us ? Are we worth attacking ? Can we defend ourselves ? and,
Can we afford the expense ?
England will no doubt defend us, but it is impossible that her fleets
should be everywhere, and you cannot expect her single unarmored ships of
no great size, to lie in ports where they would not be assisted in case of need
by batteries, and might bo caught in a trap by a superior force. Were such
a ship for instance lying at Hobart Town, and was there reason to suspect a
probable visit fiom a more powerful enemy, it would be clearly her duty to
put out to sea, where she could escape or manoeuvre, unless there existed a
local system of defence with which to co-operate. It must also be remembered
that it may often be the duty of a naval commander to keep his force well in
hand, ready to direct it on any point that might be threatened, or himself to
attack an enemy, for offensive operations are often the best defence. I think
that it may be reasonably expected that in a war England would be able to
prevent any powerful expedition being directed against the colonies : Such
an expedition could not be fitted out and get to sea secretly, it would
probably never get to sea at all, and if it did, it would almost certainly be
taken or destroyed. I doubt not also but that England would take vigorous
measures by the employment of swift cruisers to protect commerce and to
capture hostile cruisers or privateers; indeed we already hear that she is
prepared to do so, but the seas are wide, and even in the old days of sailing
vessels, at the end of last century and beginning of this, when we had clouds
of cruisers and privateers of our own on the seas, we never did absolutely
succeed in clearing them of small hostile cruisers and privateers though we
did clear them of hostile fleets ; We must not forget Paul Jones, and we all
remember how much injury the Alabama inflicted upon the commerce of the
Northern States before she was met and captured, though several vessels were
solely occupied in her pursuit; therefore I do think that it is probable that
some vessels of that class for which telegrams tell us a national subscription


is now being raised in Russia, may succeed in eluding English cruisers for a
while, and may attack and levy subsidies upon, or in default, plunder, British
settlements that are not ready to resist them.
Are we worth attacking ? The bullion in the banks would be
a rich prize, as has been noted in Russian newspapers which have
lately published the Colonial Bank returns, but the bullion in the banks
would by no means be necessarily the measure of the subsidy required?the
measure of the ransom would be the measure of the strong man?s cupidity
and the defenceless man?s fear. Moreover, the destruction of shipping and
of stores, the interruption of commerce, the collapse of public works and of
public and private credit, would only be remedied by time and by the impo*
sition of heavy taxation. I once asked an eminent merchant what he would
do under these circumstances, and he said, ? Well, it might happen, and if
it did, I think I should arrange my affairs as well as I could, and move off
to safer quarters.? (Laughter. ) I said, ? would it not be wiser to pay a
small insurance in the form of defence, and make things safe ?? Bemember
too, that to pay subsidies and ransoms is the surest way to invite future visits.
It is a policy as fallacious as it is disgraceful ; it has ever had the same
result, it is like offering a premium for robbery. And further, bear in mind
that having once bought experience, people would raise an outcry for de-
fence, for locking the door after the purse was stolen, and very little left
wherewith to buy a lock.
Tasmania is exposed to attack, on account of her strategical position,
which Captain Columb in his lecture at the United Service Institute pro-
nounced, without contradiction, to be one of the eight or ten most important
ones in the foreign possessions of Great Britain, and I have not failed to
bring this circumstance under the consideration of the Imperial authorities,
as also when Governor of "Western Australia I brought the strategical im-
portance of King George?s Sound under their notice. I hold these two
positions to be the most important strategical ones in Australia, and the
occupation and fortification of Hobart Town, or of King George?s Sound
which could be made almost impregnable, would entail great efforts and an
immense expenditure for their recovery. I hope that our delegates at the
approaching Australian Conference, will bring the subject of defensive
federation before it, for the hostile occupation of Hobart Town or of King
George?s Sound, would, in the very highest degree, affect the
interests of all Australia. I do not, under present circumstances, anticipate


as at all probable or possible, an attempt at such an occupation, but
nevertheless it were wise to provide against it, as altered circumstances
may arise, and to do so is beyond the unassisted means �f Tasmania, whilst
Western Australia cannot fairly be called upon to protect King George?s
Sound, a small isolated settlement out of her line of trade with England
(though in that of most of the rest of Australia,) at a cost,
far beyond her means. A company of local rifles to aid is all that could be
expected from her, and that from my knowledge of the spirit of Western
Australians in military matters, I am sure would not be asked in vain.
Hobart Town is further liable to a hostile visit from small cruisers, because
it can be more easily attacked than the ports of other neighbo ring colonies,
whose preparations for defence have rendered, or will rend er, their principal
ports unassailable for unarmored vessels. Colonel Scratchley, R.E., said
to me a few days ago that he considered that Hobart Town was the most
likely place in the Australian Colonies to be attacked, and at my request
he authorised me publicly to quote that opinion; the opinion I need not tell
you of an exceedingly able military man, who has made an especial study of
such questions.
Can we defend ourselves ? In the opinion of the most competent
authorities, of His Excellency General Sir W. Jervois and Colonel
Scratchley, R. E., we can, against such a foe as is likely to molest us, or
rather, in my opinion, as would be likely, were we unprepared, for such
vessels will not, I think, run serious risks at a distance from any friendly
harbor, affording means for refit. Our batteries would soon destroy any
vessel they once crippled, if they made half as good practice as I have heard of
here, and have seen made by Western Australian Volunteers, and if the enemy
escaped to sea, she would probably fall an easy prey to an English ship,
and if requiring to bedecked, her case would be almost desperate. These
are great risks to run, few men would unnecessarily incur them ; moreover,
we may confidently rely upon England being ready to assist those Colonies
especially, which help themselves, as she has already done in the case of
Victoria.
Can we afford the expense ? Look at the matter as a matter of in-
surance, at the unprecedentedly sound and progressive position this Colony is
now in, consider whether it would be wise to risk a check to this prosperity
to save a trifling outlay, for it is trifling compared to your resources. I
leave the answer to yourselves.


And now I come to my third point. The more fully we realise that
we and all men have duties, and make our lives lives of duty, the better,
higher, and happier we shall be. Let us honor those who worthily fulfil
self-imposed duties for the general good. I hope that the men of the North
will not be behind their brothers of the South, who have come forth so well and
nobly to take an active part in serving the country. (Cheers.) lam glad
to hear that cheer; healthy rivalry is good for the public at large. (Ap-
plause.) Now, no man does this but at the cost of some personal sacrifice,
and yet in a few days far more men offered than we asked for, and I doubt
not but that in ihe event of danger threatening, any required
number of men of the best sort might be obtained. I am sure
the men of Launceston will not hang back. Some may say, as I
have heard it said, ? but in the event of a fight we would turn out
to a man,? but unfortunately a custom prevails of hanging or shooting any
persons not in the uniform of a regularly enrolled corps who may be taken
in arms ; and in the French war the Prussians, by no means an uncivilised
enemy, in such cases shot hostages selected by lot from among the un-
armed inhabitants, when they could not or would not deliver up those who
had so fired on them, and levied extra contributions besides. Fancy our
friend, the Mayor, in such a predicament. (Laughter.) At Bazeilles they
gave up the village to the flames, and men, women and children perished or
were slain. But putting aside this little inconvenience, the fact remains
that undisciplined men, acting on their own devices, might most often be as
much or more in the way of friends as of foes ; no Government would bo
justified in entrusting them with arms unless put under strict control
in purely defensive positions, and even then, it would be a great risk, and
very doubtful gain, if any. I doubt not men?s bravery, but I would most
strongly impress upon Volunteers that though our race is a fighting race, and
comes of ? fathers of warproof,? it is one singularly impatient of control,
perhaps even more so in colonies than at home, and therefore I say
that obedience and strict discipline and respect to officers is the
first and most essential requisite. You may shoot well, you may
drill well, you may march well, but unless you bring to your work
strict discipline, and unquestioning and implicit obedience, you are a pow-
erful piece of machinery under no control, out of gear, with wheels
working wildly in different directions, and consequently utterly useless.
You may be sure that there is no man who does not better himself by


gaining that self control which is necessary for discipline and obedience,
more especially if he gives that obedience because it is a self imposed duty,
possibly to one in many respects his inferior ; and if this is a lesson to men,
so also morally as well as physically it is a valuable training for boys, and I
wish all our schools would have cadet corps. I would give every encourage-
ment in my power to them.
When I speak of discipline and drill, I do not want undue
attention and time to be given to what I call show drill. You
must drill to become perfect in the handling and use of your wea-
pons, and you must drill in order that you yourselves may be readily
and easily moved and handled, for all such purposes as are likely
to be practically useful in the particular kind of services which you
are likely to be called upon to render. This attained, I advise much practice
in the actual operations and on the actual ground where you might be called
into action, and I strongly advocate the institution of an annual camp, which
I consider will be most essential. I would suggest to my friends, the hunting
men, the formation of a very small corps of Irregular Cavalry, select riders,
armed lightly, and mounted on picked horses ; they might be of great use in
conveying intelligence and orders, and in the event of a landing, as scouts,
patrols, and videttes. (Applause.)
There is another point that I wish to impress upon those of my hearers
who are about to take part in the Volunteer movement. Very much depends,
almost everything depends, upon the officers. Now a man is not necessarily
fitted to be an officer because he is a gentlemanly man, a good fellow, or even
a valuable member of society. These qualities may be advantages, but what
is above all wanted, is a man who can unite firmness with tact,
who possesses coolness and nerve, who has good sense and military
aptitude, and who will give up his time to study and learn his work
thoroughly. Sir Garnet Wolsley, in one of his admirable
hand-books, which I hope will be read by all Volunteer officers, says that a
complete theoretical knowledge of his work and duty is even more essential to
a Volunteer than to a regular officer, and he gives good reasons. A Volunteer
officer ought indeed to be an enthusiast at his work, and should any officer
neglect the duties that he has voluntarily assumed, I should certainly advise
him to resign, or approve his dismissal. (Great applause.) I want you to
make the thing a reality. If it is not to be a reality better have nothing at all
to do with it (cheers), and I tell you you cannot make it a reality without ear-


nest work, discipline, and diligence for the men, painstaking exertion for the
officers. Difficulties will arise, this and that may at first go wrong but patience,
forbearance, and public spirit must smooth down obstacles and pave the
way to success, a success, I earnestly hope, solid and permanent, and destined
to influence the future character and destiny of those who are to come after
you in Tasmania, who I trust will grow up self-reliant, and consequently
self-respecting, and will look upon their defensive organisation, not as the
outcome of any sudden panic, but with a just pride as the fulfilment of a duty
co-relative with the possession of political freedom.
His Excellency sat down amid loud and continued cheering.
Before leaving the Town Hall the Governor presented his prize, a Silver Cup, to
Sergeant-Major Martini, and a Service of Plate, the Artillery Company?s prize, to
Sergeant Prosser. His Excellency promised another Cup to be competed for next
year, and said that Mrs Weld and his daughters had authorised him to say that they
would work Colors for the Defence Corps when it was fully organised.
