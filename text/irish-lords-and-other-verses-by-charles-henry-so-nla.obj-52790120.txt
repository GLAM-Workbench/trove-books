There’s something that I leant to say;
If I only knoo the words!
And a song I’d like to sing some day;
If I only knoo the toon!
W’en the clouds, at sunrise, paint their tips
With crimson botes (like Emma’s lips),
I could sing about it, like the birds,
If I only knoo the toon and words!




HALF-SEAS OVER.
Halt-seas over I was born,
Rolling through the Spanish Main,
On a dull October morn
(And the old man “Drunk again!'')
“Half-seas over!” Blissful state,
Master, bo’s’n, cook and mate,
Do n’t know Singapore from Dover,
And do n’t care—when “half-seas over”!
“Half-seas over” —on my back;
Ether mask upon my face;
Whitened ceiling turning black, —
What care I for time or place!
“Half-seas over’’ —state sublime!
All is recklessness and rhyme!
Thank the Gods and Mr. Clover
That have sent me “half-seas over”!
“Half-seas over!" When I die,
All I ask of yon, ray dear,
Is to kiss me where I lie,
And mv soul shall know no fear.


“Half-seas OA r er” I shall see
All at last is Avell Avith me.
Though I 've ever been a rover.
Kiss me—when I’m “half-seas over”!
THE BONNY DEE-SIDE.
Green groAvs the grass, and slow Avaves the corn;
Shrill calls the plover to the still grey morn;
Swift speeds my horse, as lonely I ride,
But I would I w r ere again by the bonnie Dee-side 1
Clear trills the laverock hy Banchory’s hraes;
Broom is in blossom, and heather’s ablaze.
Blue curls the reek where my auld freen’s bide.
And I’m wearying for hame, by the bonnie Dee-
side!
Soft sighs the wind and fair falls the night;
Sweet smells the Avattle and the moon shines
bright,
Clear gleam the stars, and calm Aoavs the tide,
But I would I Avere in Cults, by the bonnie
Dee-side!
Oh, for the heather, and, oh, for the whin!
Oh, for the burnie in the lang lone lynn!
Oh, for the peat-reek at eventide,
And the auld freen’s at hame,
By the bonnie Dee-side!


MY CURRICULUM.
For years I drudged and hoped and prayed,
And drank and smoked and spent and played,
And sat up till the cows came home,
And mugged through many a musty tome.
I slept through lectures dull and long, —
Filled notebooks full of notes, all wrong,—
Dissected bodies, ground at bones,
And studied drugs and bugs and stones.
I bought weird clothes and “did the block,”
Drew sketches, on my cuffs, of “Jock,”
And fell in love and failed my “first,”
And thought my little heart would burst!
I sat on beds and sounded lungs,
And counted pulses, looked at tongues,—
And danced till four and slept till ten,
Then worked till eight and danced again,
I lounged through wards, attended “mids,”
And vaccinated screeching kids.
I “ground,” I “wasted,” “lazed,” and worked,
I “stewed” for weeks and then I shirked.
I played the fiddle and the fool, —
And also cards, and likewise pool,
Until with headaches, tears, and damns
At last I scraped through my exams!


Then came the “capping”—the DEGREE!
Me voilii ! X.Y.Z., M. 8.!
* * * *
And through long years of joy and pain,
I’ve nearly learned it all again.
WHAT!
What do you say with your eyes,
Looking right straight into mine?
Is it “I love you!” or “Do you love me?’
What are you looking at? What do you see?
Is it delight or surprise,
That makes them gleam so, and shine?
There comes a shadow between,
So that I cannot see in!
Is it another’s, or is it my own?
Now it has gone again! Where has it flown?
Whose was it? What did it.mean?
Was it the shade of my sin?
Plash! There’s the message again!
What is it? What do you mean?
How to decipher it! How to divine!
How? If I have not the key? Is it mine ?


Is it a portent of pain?
Is it the love that has been?
Look! Here! Eight straight into mine
What do you say with your eyes?
Is it a challenge, a warning, a fear?
Is it a wish, that for words is too dear,
Born of a passion like wine?
Is it the love that denies?
Oh! but my very soul dies,
Calling to yours for a sign!
Must that inscrutable, fathomless gaze
Taunt me and haunt me the rest of my days?
What do you say with your eyes.
Looking deep down into mine?
O'HALLORAX HILL.
There are three trees on OTlalloran Hill,
All stark and stiff beside the sea,
And ’twas beneath the middle one
Love caught my love, and he caught me.
And once I looked upon the sky,
And once I looked upon the shore,
And once into the eyes of him
That left me there, and came no more.


The leaves that kissed above our heads,
And smiled to see two lovers meet,
Have dried and fallen, one by one,
And now lie crushed beneath my feet.
The blossoms that made sweet the air
To stir my heart like golden wine,
Are withered as the joys I knew,
And wet with tears and salt with brine.
There are three trees on O’Halloran Hill,
All stiff and stark, beside the sea;
I would that I lay in the sand,
Deep down beneath the middle tree.


ON THE LAND




THE SAMFIRE FLATS.
Do you ever wish you Avas back agin on the
Samflre Fiats, Eliza?
Do you ever think of the limestone hit on the
Samflre Flats, my dear?
You’ve been a long time gone, an’ you was
never a one for Avritin’,
An’ avc ’aven’t ’ad no neAvs of you for gettin’
on a year.
Do you recollect the old log by the big bend
on the river?
Do you ever fancy you ’re settin’ there with
me, like you uster do?
—I seen some “So long, Marys” a-growin’ down
there last Sunday;
I was settin’ there an’ thinkin’ till it seemed
like you Avas there too.
An’ the silver beet in the garden’s cornin’ up
first-rate, Eliza ;
An’ old Moll’s a foal by Darky as’ll make
a A. 1 ’ack;
An’ I’ve cleared a bit of the mallee by the big
Majuba sand ’ill,
An’ Daisy’s ’eifer’s blown ’erself. She got
to Thompson’s stack.


But if’s awful quite and lonely now at the
Samflre Flats. Eliza;
It’s ter’ble quite and lonely since you left us
in the spring;
An’ the sun don’t shine so bright, since, nor
the flowers ain’t near so pretty,
An’ the earth don’t seem to smell so sweet,
an’ the birds don’t seem to sing.
An’ oh! w’en are you cornin’ ’ome agin to the
Samflre Flats, Eliza?
W’en are you cornin’ ’ome agin to the lime-
stone ’ut, my dear?
You’ve been a long time gone, an’ you was never
a one for writin’,
An’ we ’aven’t ’ad no news of you for gettin’
on a year!


THE MALLEE FIRE.
I suppose it just depends on where you 're raised.
Once I met a cove as swore by green belar!
Couldn’t sight the good old mallee-stump I
praised;
Well! —I could n’t sight belar, and there you
are!
But the faces in the fire where the mallee-
stump ’s a-blinking
Are the friendliest I ever seen, to my way o’
thinking!
In the city where the fires is mostly coal —
There! I can’t a-bear to go and warm my feet!
Spitting, fizzing things as hasn’t got no soul!
Things as puffs out yaller smoke instead of
heat!
But at home —well, i t i s home when the mallee-
stump’s a-burning,
And the evenin’s drawing chilly and the season
is a-tnrning.
And there’s some as runs ’em down because
they’re tough.
Well? And what’s the good of any think as
ain’t ?


No. It’s nary use to serve ’em any bluff,
For they’d use up all the patience of a saint.
But they ’ll split as sweet as sugar if you know
the way to take ’em ;
If you don’t, there is n’t nothink in the world
as ’ll make ’em.
They ’re tremenjus hard to kindle, tho’, at first:
Like a friendship of the kind that comes to
stay.
You can blow and blow and blow until you
burst,
And when they won’t, they won’t burn, any-
way!
But when once they gets a start, tho’ they make
no shovvv flashes,
v /
Well, they’ll serve you true and honest to the
last pinch of ashes!
SMITH’S EMILY.
As I was gallopin’ into town,
From Simpson’s place out back o’ the hill,
I met Smith’s Emily drivin’ down
For bran an’ pollard from Thompson’s mill.


“Gidday,” says Emily : “Day,” says I,
An’ pulls me nag up into a walk.
“An’ ’ow’s the folks at the Errenbri?”
(She ain’t a gal as is give to talk.)
Oh, Emily, Emily Smith!
A lot I cares for yer kin or kith;
But there in yer cart r
You’ve got ’old of me ’eart, !/
An’ I longs to kiss yer, Emily Smith!
She looks me up an’ she looks me down,
An’ “Middlin’, thanks,” she says, with a smile.
’Er eyes are tender an’ bright an’ brown,
An’ keeps a-mockin’ yer all the while.
She plucks a spray from a passin’ bush,
An’ starts to chew the tip of a twig,
An’ says “I reckon I’ll make a push”;
(’Er mouth screwed up an’ ’er eyes all big.)
Oh, Emily, Emily Smith!
It’s ’ard to say w’at yer does it with;
But, right way or wrong,
Yer can pull me along,
An’ I think yer knows it, Emily Smith!
I says, “Oh, w’at’s yer ’urry?” saysl;
Then —“Don’t yer know as I love yer so?”


Yes, just like that, an’ I don’t know why —
But she only laughs, an' says “Yes, I know!”
Then “Will yer marry me, Em’?” I says;
(The cart was stopped an’ I ’eld ’er ’and)
“I’ll love yer true to my dyin’ days” —
She only says, “Ain’t the sunset grand!”
Oh, Emily, Emily Smith!
If life’s a muddle, and love’s a myth,
It’s nothing to me
W’at the answer may be,
For you ’re all I cares for, Emily Smith!
CHURNING.
“Yes! I’ve ’card yer say all that before!
Giddaway! There ! You great silly crane !
There’s a panful o’ milk on the floor!
Di’n’t I tell yer you’d capsize the lot if
you did that again?
“Oh, clear out! You ’ll turn all the milk sour!
You . . . My cripes! Billy Baker, you do !
You’ve been tryin’ that caper this hour;
Just you do it, an’ see if your arm isn’t
pinched black and blue!


“Oh, of course! You coves reckon us girls
Believes anythink yous like to say,
W’en you put all your front ’air in curls,
An’ come grinnin’ around all the time like
them blokes in a play!
“But we is n’t all barmy! Giddout!
Le’ me go Bill! Oh, d o n’t! Le’ me go!
(What a mercy there’s no one about!!
We 11... just one, you great clumsy ... Now
clear out! You hinder me so!”
SOLD UP.
Who’s a biddin’ for the gin-case? W’at d’yer
say?
(All right, missus!) Here! I’ll start it at a
pound.
Now then, gents, it’s goin’ lively. Fire away!
Look alive, or s’elp me bob, I’ll knock it
down!
Just a common bloomin’ gin-case? No, it
ain’t.
Hand it up ’ere, mister. Thanky! Look at it —
Half to pieces,—old and shaky,—not much
paint—
But it ain’t a common gin-case. Not a bit!


See that lanky half-grown saplin' by the door?
He’s ’er eldest son; six foot, if ’e’s an inch;
But she rocked ’ini in that gin-case, on the floor;
An’ there’s been two of ’em in it, at a pinch.
An’ the gal out there, a-leanin’ on the fence—-
Them there rockers was put on w’en she was
born.
W’at say? Half-a-crown, sir? You was nigh
too late!
Sev’n an’ six, gents! Look alive before it’s
gone!
Are you done at three half-crowns? At eight
an’ six?
Just another eighteenpence to make it ten!
Much obliged, sir! . . . See them marks there
in the bricks?
Them ’ere rockers made them. Tom was in it
then.
Well, a pound I’m bid! I ain’t a-goin’ to dwell—
An’ it’s goin’ at a pound, this little bed,
(Twenty-five! No half bids! Now I’m goin’to
SELL!)
Where she uster to rock the little one that’s
dead.
Little hands that move no longer played along
Where the wood is wore all shiney on the side,


As the cradle rocked in time to mother's song!—
(The song she hasn’t sung since baby died!)
No, it ain’t a common gin-case, ain’t this ’ere,
But it’s goin’ at two pound! at two p’un’ ten!
Two pound Three! At FIVE! And now
it isn’t dear —
Except to her as uster rock it then!
An’ it’s Goin’! Goin’!! Third an’ last time—!
GONE!
* # # *
Oh, here, missus! Here’s a present from the
chaps!
What? Eh, something in it? There now; don’t
take on!
It may come in useful for the gal, per’aps.
DONOVAN’S NIECE.
The parson says, Sundays, as Heaven’s a place
Where all them that gets there ’ll meet, face
to face,
An’ never fall out nor feel gallied nor that,
But pal up harmonious, like peas in a hat.
Well, parson, he oughter know how it’ll be.
But say it’s like this. Suppose Billy an’ me


An’ Steve o’ the mill, an’ big Donovan’s niece
Pre-empted in Heaven upon tbe same piece.
Now you know as Billy stuck up to that gel
Since —how long ago it is, I couldn’t tell.
An’ Em’, well she seemed not to hate it too bad:
But Bill was about the first bloke as she had.
Then me. Well, it wasn’t as I went about
With other coves’ heifers a-cuttin’ them out.
But Em’ knocked me endways, first innin’s!
Gord’s truth!
To think she was Bill’s was like losin’ a tooth!
So me an’ Bill quarrelled, and me an’ Bill
fought—
Got drunk, and done lots of things coves didn’t
.Thought;
< An’ Em’ would love William, for maybe a week, <
i c
Then give me a fortnight while he chewed the
leek - /70
That’s how things went on for a
or more,
Till both of our feelings was pretty well sore!
She said “Yes” to me, an’ she said “Yes” to
Bill—
An’ then took an’ hooked it with Steve o’ the
mill!


It’s all very well for the parson to say
There’s no rows in heaven. But I want to lay
That we ’ll make it willin’ up there on our lease,
When Steve comes to glory with Donovan’s
niece!
REAPING.
There’s a week in the year when your troubles
never trouble,
When you’re up with the sun and a-working at
the double,
And there isn’t time to grumble while you slip
along the stubble
On your old blue stripper in the morning!
Then it’s turn out, boys, to the cleaner and the
heap,
For it keeps a-growing taller and there’s plenty
more to reap!
Oh, the world seems bigger when you 're in waist-
deep
On the old blue stripper in the morning.
You may talk of the times when the concer-
tina’s playing,
When the boys give a spree at the shanty where
you ’re staying,


And Matilda Maud’s a-blushing at the things
as you 're a-saying.
Like a rose what never had a thorn in.
But there’s whips more fun at the cleaner by
the heap,
When the birds begin to warble and Ihe day
begins to peep!
Oh, your life’s not long enough, and joy seems
cheap
On the old blue stripper in the morning.
There’s a day in the week when you ’ye finished
all the carting,
When the last bushel’s bagged, and the teams
is all a-starting,
And you seem to lose a friend when the minute
comes for parting
From your old blue stripper in the morning!
Then it’s good-bye, chaps, to the cleaner and the
heap,
For we got to leave the paddocks to the milkers
and the sheep,
And the rooster’s crowing, and the dust lies
deep
On the old blue stripper in the morning.


“JUST BECAUSE" JANE.
‘Must because” Jane was lissom and tall,
Her eyes were a deep-sea blue, —
Heavily fringed with lashes of black, —
And they looked you through and through.
Frank and free was her sunny smile,
Her laughter was honey-sweet,
And she moved with an easy undulant grace
On her slender little feet.
Jane! Jane! ‘Must because” Jane!
Came to our dance at Warrigal plain,
And every lad was merry and glad
Just because Jane was there!
‘Must because” Jane was tender and true,
But nobody thought she was.
When she said “No,” and people asked “Why?”
She would answer “Just because!”
Fancy-free was the heart of her,
And never a care had she;
But woe to the youth who fell beneath
Her innocent Avitchery!
Jane! Jane! “Just because” Jane!
Captured all hearts at Warrigal plain,


And eye challenged eye that met and
passed by,
Just because Jane was fair!
“Just because” Jane looked sideways at Tom,
And under her lids at Jack;
Will squeezed her hand behind the hall door
And he thinks she squeezed his back.
Dick and Jim got a smile a-piece,
And Michael a withered flower,
And everyone thought that he was the one!
—For a brief and blissful hour.
“Just because” Jane! Jane! Jane!
Gentle and kind to every swain!
And many a lad goes sorry and sad,
Just because Jane don’t care!
KEZIAH.
There’s a time o’ day I knows,
W’en I ’ardly don’t suppose
Most o’ yous would think o’ movin’ from your
beds,—
When the magpie starts to sing
An’ to ruffle out ’is wing,
An’ the sky is full of yallers, greens and
reds.


It’s the early break o' day,
—‘W’en it’s wakin’, you may say—
An’ all nature seems a-stretchin’ out an’
yawnin’;
W’en the mist is on the pass,
An’ the dew upon the grass,
An’ Keziar calls the cows up in the mornin’.
Oh Keziar! dear Keziar! You ’ave set
this ’eart a-flre!
Love ’as collared me without a word o’
warnin’!
All my feelin’s is in pawn,
An’ me peace o’ mind all gorn,
Since I seen yer call the cows up in the
mornin’.
She’s that awful soft an’ sweet,
An’ so light upon ’er feet,
That the trefoil ’ardly bends beneath ’er tread;
An’ she sings that loud an’ clear,
That the birds w’at’s chirpin’ near,
Seems to feel ashamed, an’ want to go to bed.
An’ ’er gentle ’azel eye,
Like a summer midnight sky,
In the sunny southern country she were born
in,


Looks a body through an’ through,
Till ’e don’t know w’at to do,
W’en she goes to call the cows up in the
mornin’.
Oh, Keziar! sweet Keziar! There! So
’elp me! I’m a liar
lf I knows ’ow many bits me ’eart is
/ // torn in!
As I’m sittin’ on the stile, Lor! I’d
p die for just one smile,
W’en yer goes to call the cows up in the
mornin’.
PUM’KIN-TIME.
Prop the winder open with the bread-tin, Mary;
Sit the baby down upon the floor.
Go an’ take the shutter down be’ind the dairy,
Stick the wash-tub up agin the door.
Bobby! Look if you can see your father cornin’!
Ain’t that pum’kin in the oven yet?
Wash them dishes, Mary! Look alive! No slum-
min’!
Emma! Please the baby, there’s a pet.


’Ere’s them ’ens been layin’ in the flour-bag,
Joolyer!
Watcher say? Ole Specky wants to sit?
Sool ’em out! Oh, shut yer mouth, or I’ll soon
school yer!
Now then, Mary! Shift yerself a bit!
“Ow’s the meat an’ taters do-un? ’Ere comes
father!
W’ere’s that boy to? Bob-6ee/ W’ere’s he
to?
’Nuff to keep a body in a perfeck larther!
Hemma! Go an’ please the baby, do!
Stick the meat an’ pum’kin on the tin-dish, will
yer?
’Ow much longer are yer goin’ ter be?
Bobby! Leave that child alone, or else I’ll
kill yer!
* * * * *
Now then, Dad! Sit up an’ ’ave yer tea.
MUMMER’S SICK.
’Ave yer fed them ’orses, Percy?
Martha! Jus’ go in ter Mum.
(Now then, Stan; don’t cry, my sonny!
Pnpper’s goin’ ter give yer some.)
Perce! You go an’ put the saddle
On the yaller mare; he quick!


Ride across to Andy Hogan’s;
Tell yer Auntie, Mummer’s sick;
Leave the panel down. ’Ere, Stanley!
Let the dawg alone, my son!
Come along and play with pupper,
An’ ’e’ll let yer see ’is gun.
Is the kettle boilin’, Martha?
Take yer Mummer in some tea,
Then you go an’ get yer supper,
No, yer needn’t wait for me.
Pupper put his hoy to bye-bye?
Daddy undress little Stan?
See if we can git ’is boots off!
That’s ’is Daddy’s little man!
Lay down, Patch! (I’m cornin’, Mum-
mer !)
Martha, fetch a bit more wood,
(All right, Mummer!) Good night, Stanley!
Go to bye-bye and be good!
’Ere’s a bit o’ somethin’, Mummer!
There now! Let me raise yer ’ead!
W’at was it the doctor told me?
W’y, ’e said —’e said—’e said- —!
Oh, my Gawd! ’e couldn’t mean
it!
Bess! you ain’t a-going ter die?


Bess, my darlin’ ....
All right, Staunie!
Pnpper’s coinin’! Don’t yon cry.

THE CHANTEYMAN.




BOUND FOE SOURABAYA!
Oh, the moon shines bright, and we sail to-night,
And we’re bound for Sourabaya!
So it’s “Farewell, Jane!” for we’re off again
With the turning of the tide!
Oh, the Java girls haven’t got no curls,
But they’ll meet us on the Praya,
And, Malay or Dutch, well, the odds ain’t much,
And the ocean’s deep and wide!
We’re bound for Sourabaya, boys,
Where the girls are kind and brown!
By the break of day we’ll be far away!
Farewell to Sydney town!
Oh, the girls look glum, when the parting’s
come,
And we ’re bound for Sourabaya!
And they weep and wail, ’cos the ship must sail
With the turning of the tide!
But we soon forget, when our sheets are wet
And the dancing dolphins play-ah,
And the gale pipes high in the mack’rel sky,
And the ocean’s deep and wide!


We’re bound for So or a bay a, boys,
Where the girls are kind and brown,
And they hope and pray that we’ve come
to stay!
Farewell to Sydney town!
When the coin’s all gone, and the hatches on,
And we’re bound for Sourabaya,
There’s a kiss for Nell, and a long farewell,
With the turning of the tide!
But there’s not much wrong, and it don’t last
long,
Tho’ she mourns you for a day-ah!
And she wears no black if you do n’t come back!
For the ocean’s deep and wide!
And we’re bound for Sourabaya, boys,
Where the girls are kind and brown,
So we’ll drink once more,
While we’re on the shore,
Farewell to Sydney town!


OFF TO RIO JANEIRO.
(A t’gau’s’l chantey.)
Have ever you lingered in Adelaide town?
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love well!)
T was there that I met pretty Emily Brown,
(And we’re off to Rio Janeiro!)
She gave me a wink and a slap on the hack,
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love well!)
Her lips they were red, and her eyes they were
black!
And we’re off to Rio Janeiro!
Hay! Ha! Bully boys all,
The sailorman hasn’t a care, oh!
A quid for your pal, and a kiss for your
gal,
And we ’re off to Rio Janeiro!
She looks me all up and she looks me all down,
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love well!)
ler skin it was white, and her hair it was
brown,
(And we’re off to Rio Janeiro!)
; asked for a kiss and she let me have two,
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love well!)
! made up the dozen; what else could I do?
(And we ’re off to Rio Janeiro!)


Hay! Ha! Bless the gals all!
The sailor gets kisses to spare, oh!
A pipe and a glass, and a rollicking lass,
And we’re off to Rio Janeiro!
She vowed she loved truly; I said so did I!
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love well!)
I promised to marry her, “Wish I may die!”
(And we’re off to Rio Janeiro!)
But kisses come easy, and promises break,
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love well!)
And both are forgot, like the foam in your wake,
(When you’re off to Rio Janeiro!)
Hay! Ha! Hear the pipe call!
Our money they ’re ready to share, oh!
They take what they can, and then find
a new man,
And we’re off to Rio Janeiro!
BLUE PETER.
There’s a flag flying there with a little blue
square,
That’s the best jolly flag in the world!
She’s the sailor’s delight, and the joy of his sight,
When she’s up at the truck, and unfurled!


She’s as blue as the sea, and as merry and free,
And I take off my hat when I greet her!
Tho’ it’s true that she’s small, she’s the flower
of them all,
And we call her the little Blue Peter!
She’s at home in all ports, and on craft of alb
sorts, /i
Prom the tramp to the floating hotel!
And the message she flings on the wind’s
willing wings,
Is a message the sailor loves well!
Give a kiss to your hart, and make ready to start,
Tho’ there’s never a Pollie to beat her,
For it’s hail, snow, or shower, we must sail in
,jn hour!
“G-efc-aboard!” says the little Blue Peter!
So good-bye to my dear! Let me dry the salt tear
With a kiss, for I’m soon coming back!
Then aboard, and away, for a year and a day,
(Or for ever, what matter to Jack!)
You bid Molly farewell, Avhile you’re thinking
of Nell,
And how long it will be till you meet her —
“Lay aloft, there! Make sail! Slacken buntline
and brail!
Homeward bound!” says the little Blue Peter!


So we ’ll empty a glass, to the flag and the lass,
( Tho ’ I can’t tell you which is the sweeter!)
Here’s to Nellie and Poll! And to Susie and
Doll!
And hurrah for the little Blue Peter!
TAWPS’L HALYARDS.
Oh! the girls of Melbourne town, my boys!
Ah hay! Ah lay!
With eyes of blue or brown, my boys!
Ah ha! Yaha!
Are taut an’ trim, an’ tidy craft,
An’ rigged both square an’ fore-an’-aft,
An’ some they cried, and some they laughed—
Farewell, my love, farewell!
They love the handy sailor-man,
Ah hay! Ah lay!
The navy chap, or whaler-man,
Ah ha! Ya ha!
His hands of Stockholm tar may smell,
He mayn’t talk sweet or tog up swell,
But he knows the way to treat ’em well —•
Farewell, my love, farewell!


When the sailor comes to port, my lads,
Ah hay! Ah lay!
An’ he spies a girl to court, my lads,
Ah ha! Ya ha!
He don’t say “May I make so free?”
But sits her down upon his knee,
An’ gives her kisses, one, two, three —
Farewell, my love, farewell!
Then he wastes no time in foolery,
Ah hay! Ah lay!
But he buys her lots of joolery,
Ah ha! Ya ha!
He loves her while he’s on the shore.
And kisses her a great deal more,
Then bears away for Singapore—
Farewell, my love, farewell!
But they all love Jack in spite of it,
Ah hay! Ah lay!
An’ I think they’ve got the right of it,
Ah ha! Ya ha!
He don’t stay long in any clime,
But while his pocket holds a dime,
He gives the girls a bully time—
Fareivell , my love . farewell!


FROM THE SEA.
Tlie agent's off. the anchor’s up,—
The old man ’s come aboard.
By four bells in the dog-watch
He’ll be drunk as any lord!
We’ve all sail set, and drawing well
And Paddy Doyle’s been paid.
We’re full and sound, A 1 at Lloyd’s,
7 »' 7
And bound for Adelaide!
For Adelaide! For Adelaide!
She is the sailor’s joy!
She’s fresh and fair, is Adelaide,
And plump, and not too coy!
I’ve sailed the blessed world around;
Loved gals of ev’ry shade,—
But none so fair as can compare
With saucy Adelaide.
There may be dirty weather due,
Before we cross the line;
The rations may be none too good,
The limejuice none too tine!
The mate is handy with the spike,
The bo’s’n’s Boston-made,
But we’re on a bowline, doing ten,
And bound for Adelaide!


For Adelaide! For Adelaide!
She’s just the rosy peach!
She loves the whole ship's company,
And keeps a kiss for each!
I wouldn’t take a thousand pounds
For just one single braid
Clipped from the shining little head
Of bonny Adelaide!
The westerly has thrashed us o’er
The Great Australian Bight;
The old man reckons we’ll be off
The Semaphore, to-night!
Since last I saw the Obelisk
Far round the world I’ve strayed,
But always kept my heart’s best love
For little Adelaide!
For Adelaide! For Adelaide!
So sweet and sound and rare!
So trim and tight, with eyes so bright,
And gaily waving hair!
I’ve just about been ev’rywhere,
And many games I’ve played,
But now I’m singing “Home, Sweet Home!”
Hurrah! for Adelaide!


A CAPSTAN CHANTY.
All you jollies as are homeward-bound,
(With a Hai-ya! we’re shovin’ ’er along!)
And all you Pollies as’ll spend a pound,
(Halleyeh! come pull ’er over!)
We’ve signed our articles for London Town,
And the tide will serve before the sun goes down,
And I ’ll shout for Polly with my last ’arf-crown!
(With a Hai-ya! Johnnie is a rover!)
Then up with the anchor! (Tweedle-eedle-
eedle-eedle!)
Round with the capstan (Dolly is a daisy!)
Out with the spanker! (Tweedle-eedle-eedle-
eedle!)
Hey! for the jollies that are homeward
bound!
Eh! W’at-cheer, Polly, with the eyes so blue!
(An’ a Hai-ya! we ’re shovin’ ’er along!)
Here’s Jack a-swearin’ ’e’ll be always true!
(Halleyeh! come pull ’er over!)
Just kiss him cheerily, and say good-bye,
He’s a wife and family in Peckham Rye,
But he ’ll soon be back again, so do n’t you cry!
(With his Hai-ya! Johnnie is a rover!)


We’ve girls in Melbourne and in Sydney too!
(With a Hai-ya! we’re shovin’ ’er along!)
An’ at Nagasaki an’ at Timbuctoo!
(Halleyeh! come pull ’er over!)
At Santiago an’ at Wei-hai-wei,
At San Francisco an’ at Table Bay,
An’ we’re true to all until we gets away,
(With our Hai-ya! Johnnie is a rover!)
So good-bye ’Lizabeth an’ good-bye Moll;
(With a Hai-ya! we’re shovin’ ’er along!)
An’ farewell Emily, an’ farewell Poll!
(Halleyeh! come pull ’er over!)
The drink’s all swallered an’ the coin’s all done,
We’ve paid our footin’ an’ we’ve ’ad our fun,
And we ’ll be hull-down before the mornin’ sun!
(With a Hai-ya! Johnnie is a rover!)
So up with the anchor! (Tweedle-eedle-
eedle-eedle!)
Bound with the capstan (Dolly is a daisy!)
Out with the spanker! (Tweedle-eedle-eedle-
eedle!)
Hey! for the jollies that are homeward
bound!




IRISH LORDS.




IRISH LORDS.
The clover burr was two feet high, and the
billabongs were full;
The brolgas danced a minuet, and the world
seemed made of wool;
The nights were never wearisome, and the days
were never slow,
When first we came to Irish Lords, on the road
to Ivanhoe.
The rime was on the barley-grass as we passed
the homestead rails;
A Darling jackass piped us in, with his trills
and turns and scales;
And youth and health and carelessness sat on
the saddle bow—
And Mary lived at Irish Lords, on the road to
Ivanhoe.
On every hand was loveliness, and the Fates
were fair and kind;
We drank the very wine of life, and we never
looked behind;
And Mary! Mary, everywhere, went flitting to
and fro,
When first we came to Irish Lords, on the road
to Ivanhoe.


The window of her dainty bower, where the
golden banksia grew,
Stared like a dead man's glazing eye, and the
roof had fallen through.
No violets in her garden bed. And her voice
—Hushed, long ago!
When last we camped at Irish Lords, on the road
to Ivanhoe.
