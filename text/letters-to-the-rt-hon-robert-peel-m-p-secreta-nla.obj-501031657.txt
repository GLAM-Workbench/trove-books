PREFACE,
&c.
The inefficiency and expensiveness of the
Colonies in New South Wales and Van Die-
men’s Land, as Penal Settlements, have been
the subject of frequent remark and general
belief both in and out of Parliament; whereas,
in fact, no Penal System, whether imprisonment
in Hulks, Penitentiaries, or Jails, hitherto
adopted in this country, has proved any thing
like so effective and economical, and probably
no other that could have been adopted would
have proved so; and the prevalence of the
contrary opinion can only have arisen from not
having compared or contrasted the system of
transportation to New South Wales with the
system of imprisonment in Hulks and Peniten-
tiaries in their management and results, an
omission which is attempted to be supplied in
these Letters.
The incalculable value of those colonies are
capable of becoming to the mother country (in
consequence of being made a receptacle for


convicts,) and the means the Government pos-
sess of gradually taking off and subsisting, an
establishing as settlers there, the ie un an
population of Great Britain and Ireland aie
circumstances which have, I believe hither o
entirely escaped observation, and which, it made
apparent, (as it is trusted they will be m these
letters,) are evidently of very great importance
and general interest. _
It will be seen that all the authorities relied
on in these Letters are public and parliamentary
documents, and the details of colonial matter,
arise from the personal experience of the author,
who has resided for more than ten years in
Australasia, and now makes this humble effort
to afford all the information he may possess, on
a subject which has been hitherto but little
known or understood.
FIRST LETTER.
Sir,
Perceiving that a very considerable degree of
misconception prevails relative to the colony of
New South Wales, with reference to the pur-
poses of its original formation as a penal settle-
ment, for the punishment and reform of cri-
minal offenders ; and happening, from a resi


dence of several years there, to possess some
local knowledge of the means, resources, and,
as I conceive, the peculiar advantages of that
colony for those purposes, I beg leave to
submit the same to your consideration, Sir, a?
being the minister of the crown at the head ol
the police of the country.
I conceive the object of all penal infliction to
be, the punishment of the offender in such wise
as will, in the first place, deter others from
offending; and, in the next place, have the
effect of reforming the offender himself. Every
system of penal infliction, whether extending
to life, as capital punishment, or to liberty, as
confinement in hulks or penitentiaries, will be
effective only so far as it answers one or both
those objects, punishment and reform ; nor, in
an extended system, should the expence or
economy attending it be forgotten ; for although
it may not be the primary consideration in penal
establishments, yet it is one of very consider-
able importance. I shall therefore proceed to
shew how far the colony of New South Wales
has been found to answer as a penal settlement
in those three principal points—punishment,
reform, and economy.
Transportation is in itself certainly the most
severe punishment, next to death, that can be


inflicted. It is banishment from family, home,
friends, and all the endearing connections and
social ties of life; a man is torn from the land
of his fathers, the scenes of all Ins early associa-
tions and happiness, and doomed to be banished
to a country at the other side of the globe, o(
which he has but little or no knowledge, un-
certain of the fate that awaits him, except m tins
that it will be painful and penal in the highest
degree. He has to undergo a six months
voyage over boisterous seas and through every
variety of climate, during which he is subjected
to every privation consistent with the preser-
vation of life, to strict controul and summary
punishment in chains and irons, in a word, to
all the horrors of a sea prisona prison on
shore is bad enough, what therefore must a sea
prison be? On his arrival in the colony he is
put to hard labour; placed under the most
rigid controul, subjected to summary punish-
ment, flogging, working in irons, solitary con-
finement for every instance of disobedience,
idleness, or neglect. He has no friend to con-
sole him; no refuge to fly to ;no chance ol
escape; no alleviation of his misery, unless by
good conduct and reform. Now I would seri-
ously ask, is there any thing in confinement, in
hulks or penitentiaries, to equal this ?1 he
labour at New South Wales is more severe, the
privations greater. A man confined in hulks


or penitentiaries occasionally sees, and always
hears of and from his friends. He undergoes
no tedious, dangerous and painful voyage. He
leaves not his country or connections. When
his period of punishment expires, he returns at
once to both. In every particular, therefore,
transportation to New South Wales is a far
greater punishment than imprisonment of any
kind, however severe. If a man has not lost
all his better feelings, banishment must be the
greatest of all punishment, short of death; and
if he has lost them, yet being 'permanently re-
moved from even his vicious connections, pur-
suits and habits, will be to him very painful;
certainly more so than when only partially
removed, and with the certain prospect of re-
turning to them at the expiration of his impri-
sonment.
With reference to the reform of offenders,
the very local circumstances of New South
Wales are most favourable to it. The offender
is broken off from all his old vicious connec-
tions, habits, indulgences and pursuits. The
convicts are so widely distributed in New South
Wales, that men from the same town or neigh-
bourhood are not often associated together, and
if they should happen to be so, there is nothing
to reunite them, as there is neither time, oppor-
tunity, or material to plunder; neither have


they means or opportunity of indulging in the
vices of gaming, drunkenness or debauchery;
they are in short forced, from the want of means
and opportunity, to abstain from the vicious
and immoral habits which they had been accus-
tomed to indulge in. The offender acquiies
habits of useful industry. As soon as he arrives
in the colony he is immediately assigned over to
the government superintendent of works, or to
the settler, and employed in agricultural or
domestic labour, of such a kind as is serviceable
to the employer, and beneficial to the offender,
as it will enable him, after the term of his sen-
tence expires, to become a settler himself, 01
obtain an honest livelihood. Such men as
happen to be assigned to settlers have peculiar
advantages as to reform ; they become domes-
ticated in the family; have an example of good
order and industry constantly before them ;
are* subject to a more strict, and at the same
time a milder superintendence; they must
work, and work well, for the settler, but at the
same time they are better treated, they are used
more like domestic servants than compulsory
labourers; and if the convict has one spark of
moral feeling, or even ambition, remaining, he
will be most powerfully stimulated to reform ;
when he sees, what now happens in the greater
number of instances, that the very master he is
serving was once in his own condition, and


rose to be a master and a settler by a course of
obedience, industry and good conduct. Ano-
ther great circumstance is, that the offender
cannot return to his vicious habits if he would.
In New South Wales, a new infant colony, there
is but little opportunity to plunder, and still
less temptation if there was opportunity. The
difficulty of concealment, and facility of detec-
tion, it is obvious must be infinitely greater in a
country where every person is known, where
there can be no regular receiver of stolen
goods, and where they cannot be disposed
of when stolen, than in the crowded cities and
towns of England abounding with wealth and
temptations to plunder; so that, in fact, from
the mere scarcity of materials, if I may use such
an expression, the difficulty of concealment and
disposal, and the certainty of detection and of
punishment, crime is rendered unsafe, unpro-
fitable, and not worth pursuing; and is conse-
quently abandoned, excepting in the instance
of men so totally hardened in vice as to be in-
capable of reforming their habits under any
circumstances.
A regular system of reward for good con-
duct, and consequent encouragement to reform,
has been established in New South Wales, and
successfully acted upon hitherto. The con-
victs, upon their arrival in the colony, are put


to domestic and agricultural labour, in the
service of the government or of the settlers;
after a certain period of time, from three to five
years, if a man has conducted himself with
diligence, sobriety, and faithfulness in his ser-
vice, and upon obtaining a certificate to that
effect, signed by his master, the district chap-
lain, and a magistrate, he obtains what is called
a “ Ticket of Leave,” whereby he is dispensed
from compulsory labour, either for the govern-
ment or the settler, and permitted to employ
himself for his own private advantage and sub-
sistence. After holding this “ Ticket of Leave”
for a certain time, three or five years more, if
there has been no complaint or charge against
him, and upon a further certificate of continued
good conduct and industry, he obtains what is
called an “ Emancipation,” that is, a pardon
upon the condition of his continuing to reside
in the colony ; whereby he becomes freed from
all the penalties of transportation, and restored
to all the privileges and capacities of freedom.
He then also becomes entitled, by the king’s
instructions to the governor, to a grant of land
in perpetuity, a certain number of acres for
himself, his wife, and each child, if he has any,
and to provisions for his subsistence, until he
can raise a crop, and seed, and implements to
bring his land in cultivation ; and thus becomes
a settler or freeholder, possessing an estate sut


licient for the maintenance of himself and his
family by honest industry. By such a regular
system of gradual reward held out to indus-
trious, faithful and honest conduct, it is obvious
the greatest possible stimulus to reformation is
provided, and full and fair opportunity given to
every well-disposed man to reform his conduct,
and atone for his offences. Indeed the system
which prevails in New South Wales, and which
certainly was intended by its establishment and
by its founders, is such as to be in fact a school
of correction and reform. The offender is
punished, and severely punished, by banishment
from his country and connections; under-
going a long and painful sea-voyage, confined
in a sea prison, compelled to hard labour and
severe privations, and subject to rigid controul,
summary and severe punishment. And he is
reformed by being broken off from the possi-
bility of indulging his vicious and immoral
habits, and by being compelled to acquire a
respectful demeanour, habits of labour and
economy, of self-denial and sobriety, and the
employment he is engaged in is healthy in itself
and beneficial to him, as it prepares and enables
him to procure an honest subsistence for him-
self at the expiration of his sentence. And
when his sentence expires, or is remitted, in-
stead, as is the case in England, of being
thrown back with a tainted character upon


society already overflowing with men of un-
tainted character in want of employment,
where there can be but very little prospect in-
deed of his succeeding in obtaining honest
bread, and therefore almost a certainty of being
again driven to criminal practices or star\ ation ;
instead of being placed in such untoward cii-
cumstances, the emancipated convict in New
South Wales has the certainty of either becom-
ing an industrious freehold settler on his own
estate, or of obtaining an honest and comfort-
able livelihood for himself by his labour, in a
country abounding with good land, to which
emigrants are continually flocking, and where
there is employment and subsistence for every
hand.
The extent to which reform has been effected
among the convicts heretofore sent to New
South Wales, is not, I believe, generally or in-
deed at all known ; I shall therefore just give
a sketch of it. The number of persons trans-
ported to New South Wales, from its establish-
ment in 1788, to the end of the year 1815, was
13,801 men, and 3,265 women, total 17,066 ; of
these 6067 became free by pardon, and service,
1688 held tickets of leave, 3813 still continue
convicts, and the remainder 5498 had died,
a considerable number having previously be-
come free. Those who had become free with


their children who had come to maturity, 194 T
persons, formed in 1821, 3478 families, having
7212 children, and possessed 251,941 acres of
land in pasture, 34,769 acres in cultivation,
2447 horses, 59,469 head of horned cattle,
168,960 sheep, 26,568 swine, 3,478 houses, 15
decked vessels, of various burthen, 87,000/.
w orth of agricultural dead stock, and 300,000/.
invested in trade ; the estimated value of their
entire property being 1,562,201/. sterling, all
the creation and fruit of their own industry; and
they employed and subsisted 4,640 convict la-
bourers, making thereby a saving to the govern-
ment of 116,000/. per annum j as appears by the
colonial general muster of population and proper-
ty, for the year 1821. Here the reformation that
has taken place among the convicts, transported
to New South Wales, appears both in its nature
and degree. Of 17,000 persons transported in
thirty years, nearly 5,500 have died ; 3,800 are
still convicts ; 1,700 are so far reformed as
to have obtained the first degree of reward and
indulgence, and 6067 have become heads of
families, householders, and proprietors of landed
and other property, to the value of above one
million and a half sterling ; have upwards of
nine thousand children, who are in the course
of being educated in industrious habits, and
employ, and subsist, and thereby relieve the
crown from the expence of subsisting more


than 4600 convicts. Whatever the private
morals or failings of these people may be, and
the greater number of them are not worse in this
respect than their unconvicted fellow colonists,
they have been politically, and as far as human
laws are concerned, morally reformed. They
have become fathers of families, they possess
considerable property, created and acquired b}
industry and honest exertion, and fulfil all the
political, social, and domestic duties of citizens,
and their children are in the course of becoming,
and will become, equal to any other description
of people in any part of the king’s dominions. I
do therefore conclude, upon consideration of
these facts, that New South Wales, as a penal
settlement, has been productive in an eminent
degree of substantial and beneficial reform in
the persons transported thereto.
With regard to economy, or the expence of
the system, it can be justly appieciated only by
contrasting it with the expence that has attended
the other systems of penal infliction adopted
in England, Hulks, and Penitentaries. In the
reports of the parliamentary committees, on
transportation in 1812, on the state of gaols in
1819, and the papers laid before parliament
1819, 1821, and 1823, we have the entire ex-
pences of New South Wales, and the number of
persons transported. In the twenty-eighth finance


report, in the second report of the police of the
metropolis, and in the several reports of the su-
perintendent of hulks, we have the expenditure,
and numbers confined in the hulks. And in the
reports to parliament, by the committee of the
Millbank Penitentiary,!Bl9 to 1823, we have the
expense of that establishment, and numbers con-
fined in it. Now in order to ascertain whether New
South Wales has been more or less expensive, we
must estimate the average annual expense of
each person confined there, in the Hulks, and in
the Penitentiary, and compare the one with the
other ;or estimate what the number of persons
transported to New South Wales would have
cost, if they had been kept in hulks or peniten-
tiaries, at the same rate of expence as those who
actually were so kept. The average expence per
head per annum in New South Wales has been
from 1787 to 1y97, 28/. 3s. 6d. ; from 1797 to
1810, 18/. 145. 4 d. j and from 1810 to 1821,
251. ss. 7 \d, including subsistence, clothing,
superintendence, and the civil government, naval
and military expences of the colony, as well as
the transport of the convicts out. The ave-
rage expence per head, per annum, in the hulks,
has been from 1787 to 1797> 23/. 195. o d.\ from
1797 to 1810, 27/. 15. Bd.; and from 1810 to
1821, 3 31. 125. o d. The expence of Millbank
Penitentiary has been very great. The cost of
erecting it, including the interest thereon,


amounted, when completed for the reception
and confinement of 1000 persons, to 571,460/.,
the annual interest thereon, at four per cent.,
comes to 22,858/. being an annual expence for
lodging 1000 persons, of nearly 22/.175« 2d. each;
the expence of subsistence and superintendence
has been in 1818, 41/. 17. 21 d. per head; in
1820, 38/. 15s. 41c/., and 1821, 31/. os. 7 \d. ;
average of the three years, 33/. 17. B \d. y to
which add the interest of the cost of building,
22/. 17s. 2c/., and it makes the annual average
expence of every person confined in Millbank
Penitentiary amount to 56/. 15s. o d.
Finding the expences of Millbank Penitentiary
to have been so great, I have ascertained, as far
as parliamentary documents will enable me, the
expences of other gaols, penitentiaries, and
houses of correction, and I find them as follows,
including the interest of the cost of building,
superintendence, salaries of officers, clothing
and subsistence :
The Refuge for the Destitute, average
of the years 1815, 16, 17, 18, and
1819, per head, (see first report £. s. d.
on the police of the metropolis.) 37 2 3
The Philanthropic Institution, see se-
cond report on ditto - - 36 17 fi


£. s. d.
The London Female Penitentiary,
(see ditto) - - - - 41 6 4
The Magdalen Hospital, (see ditto) 42 8 0
Newgate, average, 1815, 16, 17, and
1818, (see Lords report on gaols) 32 15 7
Cold bath Fields House of Correction ;
Clerkenwell Prison, and Tothill-
fields Bridewell, average per head,
without clothing, (see Lords re-
port on gaols - - - 31 2 0
Bridewell Hospital, (see report on
Prisons of the metropolis) - 42 5 8
Worcester Gaol and House of Cor-
rection, (see Lords reports on gaols) 28 2 41
Maidstone Gaol, Penitentiary, and
House of Correction, (see ditto) 39 310
Taking the average of these several prisons, and
of Millbank Penitentiary, it will give a ge-
neral average, per head, per annum, for
Penitentiaries of 38/. 145. o d.
The following table shows the comparative
expence of the convict establishments of New
South Wales, the hulks, and penitentiaries.
The first column shews the actual number of
convicts confined at New South Wales in
each year; the second column contains the
.entire expences of that colony, civil, naval,
military, and transport clothing, and subsis-
VQL. n. b


tence of the convicts. The third column
shows what the expence of the same num-
ber of convicts would have been, d confined
in the hulks, estimated at the same rate per head
which those confined in them actually cost.
And the fourth column shows what the expence
would have been, if they were confined in peni-
tentiaries, estimated according to the actual
average expence of Millbank Penitentiary, and
other goals and penitential ies.
The actual expence of the hulks, has been
from 1787, to 1797, average per head, per an-
num 23/. 19s. o d. ; from 1798, to 1810, gradually
advancing from 23/. 19s. o d., to 30/. 4s. A z d., ave-
rage 27/. Is. B d. ; from 1810 to 1821, as per ac-
tual yearly expence, varying from 43/. 7s. 9 id.,
to 27/. 18s. 7| d., per head, per annum. The
expence of penitentiaries, from 1787, to 1810,
is estimated by comparison with that of hulks,
there being no penitentiaries then in use, upon
the supposition that if penitential ies had been
in use, the same rate of excess in expence would
have occurred, thathas been found to prevail since
both systems have been adopted. The expence
of penitentiaries would have been, Iheiefoie,
from 1787, to 1797, 28/. 10s. 0 d, t average, per
head, per annum j from 1797, to 1810, 31/. 4s. o dj
and from 1810, to 1821, 38/. 14s. o d.

The entire expence of New South Wales fiom
its settlements in 1788, to December 1821, has
been 5,3 01,023/. IQs. 3d., for which 33,155 poi -
sons have been transported, and subsisted, an
all the civil, naval, military, and othei expences
of the colony paid. To have kept the same
number during the same period, in hulks, would
have cost the nation, including the fitting up o
the necessary number of hulks, forty at least,
7,214,486. 35. Qd. And to have subsisted and
managed them in penitentiaries, erected and
supported, not at the same rate of expence as
Millbank Penitentiary, but, upon the most eco-
nomical plan, would have cost for superinten-
dence and subsistence only, 7,943,221/., and the
expence of erecting the necessary number of
.penitentiaries, forty at least, upon the least ex-
pensive plan yet effected, I mean on the plan of
the Maidstone Goal and Penitentiary, the erec-
tion of which, for the accommodation of 4.50
prisoners, notwithstanding the utmost atten-
stion to economy, and simplicity of style, cost
would have cost the further sum of
8,366,640/., making a total for penitentiaries,
of 16,309,861/. sterling.
In this estimate I have taken no account of
the value or produce labour of the convicts, be-
cause the labour performed in New South
Wales, is much more valuable than that of
prisoners in hulks or penitentiaries, can possibly


be. In the present state of the labouring popu-
lation of England, where the number of labour-
ers is greater than there is adequate employment,
and subsisting wages for; the employment of
convicts at labour, is of no benefit whatever to
the country; for if the work to be performed be
necessary or useful, it will afford employment
and subsistence to a certain number of labourers;
employ convicts in performing it, and you throw
out of employment an equal number of free un-
convicted labourers, who must therefore come
on the poors-rate for subsistence, and a greater
expence will be incurred thereby, in the shape
of rates, than any possible saving which the la-
bour of convicts may effect in their maintenance.
But allowing the labour of convicts in hulks and
penitentiaries, to be of all the value that it has
been estimated at, what does it amount to when
put in comparison with the value of the colony
of New South Wales. That colony is certainly
the fruit of the convicts’ labour. It now con-
tains a population of more than 40,000 souls,
who occupy upwards of 700,000 acres of land,
and possess upwards of 5000 horses, 120,000
head of horned cattle, and 350,000 sheep ; it
contains five thriving towns, and several villages;
it consumes British manufacture annually of
the value of 350,000/ ; its exports amount to
100,000/. per annum ; it employs upwards of
10,000 tons of shipping, and yields a colonial
revenue of more than 50,000 a year : whereas it


the same convicts had been kept m England,
either in hulks, penitentiaries, or any other bet-
ter system of correction, and employment, theii
labour, instead of being productive and valuable,
would have been in itself of very little value,
and, as coming into competition with tree and
unconvicted labour, would have created a far
greater expence in the shape of poors-rate, for
the subsistence of those whom it would have
thrown out of employment, than any possible
saving that would have been derived from it.
The convict in England, so far as his labour is
concerned, becomes a competitor with the fiee
labourer. The convict in New South Wales,
becomes not a competitor with, but an employer
of the free labourer of England, to the full
extent of the expence of his, the convict s
maintenance ; because all the money expended
in New South Wales, has been diiectly 01
indirectly expended in the purchase and con-
sumption of British manufactuics.
From these facts I think it cleaily appeal s,
that transportation to New South \A ales, has
been the least expensive penal system adopted
by this country. That up to the present time a
direct and positive saving of above two million
sterling has been made thereby, compared
with the other most economical system, that of
the hulks ; and as compared with the expence
of penitentiaries, the saving has been above


eleven millions sterling'; and that in every future
year, the saving will be more considerable; for
taking the average of three years, 1819, 1820,
and 1821, the expence per head, in New South
Wales, has been 20/. 13s. 7 d, ; in the hulks,
SO/. 6s. 7 d. ; and in Millbank Penitentiary,
561. 15s. 0(7., and this average of 20/. 13s. 7 d.
per head, for New South Wales, includes not
only the subsistence and superintendence of
the convicts in the colony, but also the entire
expence of the transport out, as well as that of
the government of the colony, and of the naval,
and military forces there ; in short, the entire
expence of every description which the colony
is of, both as a penal settlement and colony, to
England. The mere subsistence, and superin-
tendence of the convicts, has for the last twelve
years, cost upon an average, not more than
12/. 13s. 6d. per head per annum ; and for the
last three years 1819,1820, and 1821, 11/.65. o d.,
per head per annum; whereas the whole ex-
pence in hulks and penitentiaries, has been
merely for the superintendence, subsistence and
lodging of the convicts.
It is 1 conceive beyond doubt, that New
South Wales, as a penal settlement, has been
superior in point of economy of expence, to any
other system, and I think the same superiority
will appear in reference to its advantages,


both for the punishment and reformation of
offenders.
As a punishment, confinement in hulks or
penitentiaries, where the labour is light, the
food good, and the privations temporary, in a
man’s own country, and not cut off from friends
or connections, is not at all equal in duration,
suffering, or degree, to' transportation to New
South Wales, with all the suffering and priva-
tions attendant upon banishment from home,
connections and friends, the perils and dangers
of a long sea voyage, and the certainty of hard
labour, rigid controul, and strict discipline in a
strange land, with very little or no prospect of
ever being able to return to home or country..
As to reformation, it has been seen to what
extent it has taken place in New South Wales ;
and it certainly remains yet to be seen whe-
ther it has been effected to any extent in hulks
or penitentiaries. That reformation has taken
place in some instances in those establishments
is certain, and so far satisfactory ; but the in-
stances have been few, and, until a late period,
when an improved system of management was
adopted, the hulks were considered to be, and
in fact were, schools for vice of the very worst
description. How few, if any instances can be
shewn of men leaving those prisons, and become


ing sober and industrious fathers of families f
bringing up their children in moral and indus-
trious habits, and becoming themselves honest
and useful citizens. I very much doubt whe-
ther one-half the whole number of persons who
have been confined in those establishments have
become, upon their discharge, industrious use-
ful citizens, as has been the case in New South
Wales; for one-half the number of persons
transported to New South Wales, up to 1815,
had in 1821 (a sufficient period to allow for
reforming, six years,) become free, and were
heads of families, householders and settlers*
Indeed it is impossible, from the existing state
of the labouring population of England, that
men discharged from hulks and penitentiaries
can, even if they had been reformed while in
those establishments, continue honest. How
can a man, coming out of a hulk or penitentiary
with necessarily a tainted character, obtain
honest employment and subsistence in a coun-
try, where men of untainted character, and the
most sober and industrious habits cannot, with
all their efforts, obtain employment to subsist
by ? The consequence is, that however well-
disposed to be honest, the man is compelled to
resort to his former practices and connections,
or starve. And a greater mischief cannot be
done to any convict in England, if he has nut
the means of subsisting himself honestly, than


to keep him back from New South Wales, con-
fine him in a hulk or penitentiary, and, at the
expiration of his sentence, set him at large in a
country where he cannot get honest bread, and
consequently must return to his evil habits.
Whereas in New South Wales, the instant a
man’s term of transportation expires, he can
get full employment, and abundant means of
subsistence.
There is another circumstance belonging to
New South Wales, which makes it peculiarly
valuable as a penal settlement, and that is the
difficulty of the convicts returning from thence
after their term of transportation expires. All
those persons confined in hulks or penitentiaries
are, at the expiration of their imprisonment,
thrown back again upon the public; as has
been observed, they cannot obtain honest sub-
sistence ; they must therefore, and they do with
very few exceptions, return to their old habits
of theft and plunder, often with enlarged
vicious connections and increased talents for
mischief, so that the country is relieved from
the mischief of their theft and plunder, only
while they are in actual duress. Not so with
the convict transported to New South Wales.
He never comes back to renew his career of
iniquity, and the country becomes at once, aiid
for ever , relieved from him. It has been con


sidered, by what I hesitate not to call, a false
and spurious humanity, as a peculiarly hard fea-
ture in transportation ; that, although it may
be nominally inflicted but for a term of years,
yet it becomes, in fact, a punishment for life,
as there is no possibility of the return of the
transport at any time. Now this very circum-
stance is the peculiar advantage of transporta-
tion. How seldom do regular, old hardened
offenders, whose sole business is thieving, ever
commit themselves so as to become subject to
the higher punishments. It is well known that
transports for seven and fourteen years are,
generally, regular town thieves of the very worst
character. It becomes a real benefit to the*
country to have such persons sent out of it,
and kept out of it; and it becomes a real benefit
to themselves ; for if they remained in, or could
return to the country, they are sure to come to
destruction ; but at New South Wales they
must live without plundering, and they may
live comfortably by honest industry. Suppose,
for instance, that the 33,000 convicts which
have been transported to New South Wales had
been kept in hulks or penitentiaries in England,
what would they have been when discharged
from those establishments ? What would it have
cost the public, in the shape of plunder, to
subsist them ? What would the 10,000 children
of the convicts in New South Wales have been


if in England ? They would have been regularly
brought up to thieving and plunder. The de-
gree of mischief and extent of plunder pre-
vented by these persons being sent to, and
remaining at New South Wales, is in itself (put-
ting out of view all other considerations,) of in-
calculable benefit to the country ; and the sav-
ing to the public effected thereby is far greater
than the whole expence of the establishment of
that colony, were it even wholly unproductive.
Whereas, in fact, no money has been expended
with more advantage to the state in every point
of view.
It has, I think, been fully shewn that New
South Wales, as a penal settlement, has been
eminently successful, and completely answered
every object of effective punishment and effec-
tive reform, at a very reduced scale of expence,
that could have been reasonably expected;,
most certainly in a far greater degree than any
other penal establishment, whether hulks or
penitentiaries adopted in England : and withal
a most valuable colony has been created, has
rapidly risen to comparative wealth and pros-
perity, and possesses means and resources
capable of making it one of the most valuable
dependencies in the possession of the crown, as
will be shewn in another letter which I shall
address to you. Sir, especially on that subject-


In the meantime I beg to offer a few observa-
tions on the proposed project of making Nor-
folk Island a penal settlement, or “ Penitentiary
on a great scale.”
Mr. Bigge, in his Report on the Colony of
New South Wales, states that, in consequence
of the very considerable numbers transported in
the years 1818,1819, and 1820, the convicts had
become more numerous in the colony than at
that time, 1820, there was profitable employ-
ment for ; for after supplying all the demands
of the settlers for labourers, and of the govern-
ment works, there were then no less than four
thousand male convicts at the disposal of the
government, for whom employment was to be
procured. He therefore recommends, in the
first instance, that every facility and encourage-
ment shall be given to the emigration of settlers
from England, to the breeding and improve-
ment of Merino sheep and fine wool; and to the
extension of agriculture in the colony ; most
justly observing, that it is the truest interest of
the mother country to promote, by every pos-
sible means, the increase of settlers and the ex-
tension of agriculture ; as it was by such means
only that employment and subsistence could be
found for the convicts, and the government
relieved from expence. And, in the next place,
he recommends that three new settlements


should be formed at Moreton Bay, Port Bowen,
and Port Cartels, on the coast to the north of
Port Jackson, where all the convicts not em-
ployed at the principal settlements of Port
Jackson and Van Diemen’s Land should be
sent, as well as all convicts of idle, refractory,
or other bad conduct and habits, there to be
employed in the clearing and cultivation of
land, in cutting and preparing wood, preparing
and reducing bark, and in the cultivation of
flax and tobacco, all for sale on account of the
government. From some circumstances which
have not been made public, his majesty’s go-
vernment are, it appears, of opinion, that it is
either not prudent or impracticable to establish
the settlements recommended by Mr. Bigge ;
but Norfolk Island has been selected as a place
well calculated for all the purposes of a penal
settlement, a “ Penitentiary on a great scale,”
for the now unemployed convicts at New South
Wales, and such as may be hereafter sent out.
Who it was recommended Norfolk Island for
such a purpose I know not; but I conceive
there is not another place in the entire colony
of New South Wales so wholly unfit for a
penal settlement as Norfolk Island.
The climate of Norfolk Island is warm, vet
7 %/
good and healthy. The soil is rich and fruitful,
and will grow sugar-cane, coffee, cotton, maize,


and garden vegetables ; wheat cannot be de-
pended on as a regular crop, and the island is
subject to droughts and blight. It was origin-
ally settled at the same time with Port Jackson,
but in consequence of the entire want of a har-
bour, even for boats, and the consequent diffi-
culty of communication, as well as the increas-
ing infertility of the soil from its exposure, by
cutting down the trees, to the winds from the
sea, it was found necessary, after being settled
for twenty-five years, to abandon it altogether,
and the settlers were removed to Van Diemen’s
Land at a considerable expence to the govern-
ment.
Norfolk Island is situate about 1200 miles
from Port Jackson ; it contains between ten and
eleven thousand acres of land, and there is not
one spot on the island where even a boat can
land with safety. It must be obvious that,
from these tw r o circumstances alone, it is entirely
unfit for the employment of convicts upon an
extended scale. In the first place, supposing
every acre in the island to be capable of culti-
vation, which it is not, there would not be em-
ployment for more than between seven and
eight hundred men. Agricultural labour is
the only sort that can be carried on; (for I
cannot suppose that there can be any intention
of establishing a great manufactory to be con-


-ducted by convicts on a solitary island in the
midst of the Pacific Ocean, where there exists
neither machinery, materials, or demand for
manufactures,) five to seven hundred men may
be employed therein ; if a greater number be
employed it cannot be at hard labour ; that
number cannot possibly consume the pioduce,
it must therefore be exported, a circumstance
not to be easily performed for want of a har-
bour or shipping-place of any kind. Norfolk
Island, in order to be any thing like a penal
settlement or penitentiary, ought to have no
greater number of prisoners there than can be
employed at continual hard labour ; the produce
of the land would be far more than sufficient
to supply food for the laboureis ’, the suiplus
would have to be consumed elsewhere, to be
exported, and this cannot be effected foi want
of a harbour; so that even to the extent to
which it may be possible to find employment
for labour, it cannot answer by reason of the
difficulty of converting the produce of that
labour to any useful purpose. The first requisite
in a penal settlement, should be the means of
continual and increasing employment at hard
labour: and the second, a facility of bringing
the produce of such labour into profitable, or at
least some degree of useful consumption, nek
ther of which can be effected at Norfolk Island.
If three or four thousand convicts are to be


placed on Norfolk Island, what will be the con-
sequence ? They may be found in partial em-
ployment the first year in clearing the land, and
in erecting huts and buildings ; but when that
is done, there will not be employment for one
fourth the number, supposing the whole Island
to be cultivated as a garden: and the result
must be universal idleness with all its unavoid-
able evils. In short Norfolk Island, from its ex-
tremely confined limits, its entire want of any
labour, its solitary situation, and too great dis-
tance from the principal settlements, is the least
fit of any part of the territory of New South
Wales, for a penal settlement, and if attempted
to be carried on there on any scale, (except one
so extremely limited, as not to be worth attempt-
ing?) I hesitate not to assert, that it will, and,
from the peculiar circumstances of the island,
must assuredly fail.
The plan suggested by Mr. Bigge is in prin-
ciple the true one for employment, and conse-
quently the punishment and reformation of cri-
minal offenders. The convicts in New South
Wales should be considered as being, what they
really are, a great body of labourers at the dis-
posal of the government; and the great object,
so to employ them as to make the employment
penal and reformatory to them, and as useful
and unexpensive as possible to the state. The
VOL. ii. c


assignment of the convicts to the settlers, to be
employed in agricultural and domestic labour,
effects those purposes with the greatest advan-
tage. The convict assigned to the settler, is
compelled to continual labour; he is out of the
way of evil example ; he cannot indulge in
habits of idleness, dissipation, or theft; he gra-
dually acquires habits of industry and sobriety;
his labour is turned to profitable account; an
the government is entirely relieved from the
expence of his subsistence. The first object ol
the government therefore, should be to promote
the emigration of settlers to the colony ; and
to give every possible encouragement to its
produce.
From this view of the case it is obvious, that
the opinion, which in some degree prevails, that
the growth of New South Wales as a colony ,
renders it so jar unfit for a penal settlement, is
entirely erroneous, for the reverse is the truth ;
the more the colony increases in free population
and wealth, the more employment theie will be
for the convicts, and that kind of employment
which will be both penal and reformatory to
them, unexpensive to the state, as it will provide
them ; with subsistence, and valuable to the em-
ployers ; whereas, if you have not settleis to
employ the convicts, they must be congregated
in large gangs, and employed on immense


government farms, where they cannot be sub-
ject either to the vigilant superintendence or
strict controul of a private master; and where
habits of idleness and vice must prevail from
the very circumstances of their situation.
In the present state of New South Wales, all
the convicts cannot be distributed to settlers,
and there is therefore a considerable number still
at the disposal of the government; in 1820 that
number exceeded four thousand labourers ; at
this time 1823, it exceeds probably ten thousand.
The consideration is how or where to employ
them ; Mr. Bigge recommends the formation of
three new settlements, the convicts to be em.
ployed in cutting and preparing timber and
bark, and raising flax and tobacco, on the
government account for sale. To this plan of
employment there are some obvious objections.
As to timber,when procured, the quality is such,
and the expense of freight so great, as to make
it not worth carriage to any market in time of
peace. The cultivation of flax and tobacco
requires no ordinary industry, accuracy, and at-
tention ; these cannot be expected from compul-
sory labour, particularly of the character here to
be employed ; and I fancy immense government
farms of such a nature, would be found most
expensive and unprofitable. The formation of
an establishment at Norfolk Island, for the pur-
c 2


pose of employing the disposable convicts at
Port Jackson, is absolutely impossible, lo any
extent, and some other mode of employment
must be devised. Now there is a mode of em-
ploying the convicts to great advantage, which
is not open to these objections, and that ts, m
clearing and preparing farms for emigrants.
The operation of cutting down the trees, and
burning them, which is called clearing, is of the
simplest nature; the work is easily and soon
learnt, it is capable of being measured and
tasked, it can be accommodated to the strength
of each individual labourer, and there is no com-
plexity in it; the eye as well as the ear of the
overseer, will soon direct him to the person who
may be idle or indolent; it is a healthy occupa-
tion, and may be made more or less severe, as
circumstances may require 5 and the expense o
implements is trilling, being merely for axes and
saws In short it is of all descriptions of labour,
the best calculated for penal labour, because it
can be made more or less severe, is open to rigid
inspection and superintendence, is of a nature
to induce industrious habits, and become useful
to the convict when he becomes flee, and is
moreover useful and valuable in itself.
The colony of New South Wales contains, in
its wide extent, many sections of country, where
all the convicts that can now, or hereaftei ie


spared, may be employed to very great advan-
tage, in clearing and preparing farms for emi-
giants. If it should not be deemed prudent to
foim settlements at Moreton Bay, Port Bowen,
oi loit Curteis, there is more than a sufficient
quantity of good rich valuable land, within that
secdon of the colony which has been explored,
between Jervis Bay, and Port Macquarie, to
give employment to ten times a greater number
of convicts, than it is to be hoped, will ever be
at the disposal of the government. The exten-
sion of the settlements already formed at Port
Hunter, and Port Macquarie, will require no
additional expense for new establishments, it
will be merely the transfer of the convicts from
one part of the settlement to another, with little,
if any additional expense in the first instance,
and with the certainty of great benefit and ad-
vantage. Instead of employing the convicts in
the cultivation of immense government farms,
attended with great expense, and at best, of
doubtful advantage, they should be employed in
clearing the land, and preparing it for settlers.
I he land so cleared, should either be sold to
settlers at a reasonable rate, but always such as
to cover the expense of clearing it, or granted
out in small farms to poor emigrants from
England, at a reserved rent. From a consider-
ation of the present state of the labouring popu-
lation of England, of pauperism, and poor’s rate.


I conceive a system of pauper emigration to
New South Wales, might be effected to such an
extent, and upon such a plan, as would be of
the greatest possible advantage to this country;
for the Colony possesses such means, in an
abundance of rich land, and labour to put that
land into a state fit for the reception of poor
emigrants, as would make it capable of leceiv-
ing and subsisting all the surplus labouring
population of England, not only without any
additional expense, but with a very great saving
of expense and advantage to the countiy. This
plan I shall beg leave to submit at large in a future
letter, which I mean to address to you, Sir, par-
ticularly on that subject, and in the meantime
I shall beg leave to suggest a plan for the emi-
gration of men, of small and middling fortunes
to New South Wales.


SECOND LETTER.
Sir,
In my former letter I stated that I meant to
suggest a plan for the emigration of men of
small fortune to New South Wales. In that
letter I think I have shewn the best possible
mode of employing the convicts to he in agri-
cultural labour , assigning them to the settlers
for that purpose ; and as there is not a sufficient
number of settlers at present in the colony to
employ all the convicts, that it is the true in-
terest of the country to afford all possible facili-
ties and encouragement to emigration thereto.
As emigrants increase and prosper, and capital
is invested in New South Wales, so will employ-
ment be created for the convicts, so will New
South Wales become a better school of correc-
tion and reform, and so will the government be
relieved from the expense of subsisting the
convicts. Thus, in every point of view, will the
encouragement to emigration be found bene-
ficial in the highest degree, and it seems to be
both the duty and interest of the British govern-
ment to encourage it to that colony, at least to
the extent of creating employment for all the
convicts. Indeed, it may be assumed as a
maxim, that, in proportion as convicts are sent
out, so also should persons be encouraged to
emigrate and settle there. It is a fine country,
abounding with rich land, a most fruitful soil,
and great command of labour. The climate is


fine and healthy, and the productions of the
colony, fine wool, tobacco, &c. are valuable;
sothat every industrious man emigrating thither,
will most assuredly much better his condition-
The plan and degree of encouragement to
emigration at present afforded, however judi-
cious when first adopted, seems, from the meie
lapse of time and change of circumstances, to
require alteration. By the present system the
emigrant must possess at least 500/., or the
government will not sanction his going out, or
grant him any land on his arrival. The emi-
grant possessing 500/. will, on his arrival, re-
ceive a grant of five hundred acies of land in
perpetuity, and if he possess greater propeity,
he will receive more land in piopoition, up to
two thousand acres. Now, in the first place, the
minimum of property required in the emigrant
is fixed far too high, for a capital considerably
less than 500/. will enable a man to become a
settler in New South Wales ; and why not re-
duce it to the lowest amount that will answer.
It is obvious, that by fixing the capital required so
high, persons of less property are prevented from
emigrating, whereas in truth, the government
should encourage men of small capital, of about
200/. in preference to all others, for such men
will settle on their farms, follow agricultural
pursuits, and employ most convicts in piopoi-
tion. to their capital; and certainly the govern-


ment should give the greatest encouragement ter
the description of settlers that employ most
convicts, to the man who invests his property
in tillage agriculture . The advantage of encou-
raging tillage agriculturists will appear from
this circumstance : —a settler possessing 200/.
capital, living on and cultivating his farm, will
employ and subsist four crown labourers, or
convicts, making a saving to the government of
56/. per annum, the expense of subsisting those
convicts. Another settler possessing 2,000/,
capital, and investing it in grazing agriculture ,
that is, in horned cattle and sheep, will not
employ, if in horned cattle, more than four
men ; and if in sheep, than seven men. How
much greater therefore is the advantage to the
government of that description of settler which
I call the tillage settler than the grazing settler.
It is therefore the man of small property who
cannot engage in grazing, who must and will
live on and cultivate his farm, and who will
employ most convicts,that should be encouraged
by the government in preference to all others.
The great advantages which will be derived
from the settlement of tillage settlers in New
South Wales, both in reference to its primary
object as a penal settlement,as well as to its value
as a colony in the growth ; on the one hand, of
valuable produce for the British market, and in
its consumption on the other, of British manu-


factures, are such as to more than compensate
for a very considerable degree of expence in
promoting emigration; and if no direct com-
pensation or return could be made by the emi-
grants, yet money so expended would be most
usefully and profitably expended ; but, as will
be seen, the whole expence can be repaid, and
more than repaid by the emigrants, with in-
terest ; in fact it will be merely a loan. As no
man can expect to be selected out from his
fellow-citizens, and have considerable advan-
tages conferred upon him gratuitously, however
beneficial it may prove to the country, I con-
ceive that all the expence incurred in the esta-
blishment of the emigrant at New South Wales
should be repaid by him, as he may be able to
do so ; and upon that principle I have con-
structed the following estimates.
The great obstacle to the emigration of per-
sons of small fortune to New South Wales, sup-
posing the minimum of property required be
reduced, is the great distance and consequent
expense of the passage out. A steerage pas-
sage cannot be obtained in the trading vessels
under 35/. for adults, and 20/. for children, a
sum far too great for a small fortune, particu-
larly when there are children. A man, wife,
and two children, cannot go out at a less ex-
pense for passage than 110/.whereas, if several
families united, they could be taken out with


better accommodations than the trading vessels
afford, for the sum of 80/. per family.
The plan I most respectfully, and with all
deference submit, Sir, is as follows :
That a certain portion of the convict
labourers in New South Wales, now at the dis-
posal of the government, shall be employed in
clearing and fencing farms, and erecting houses
on them, for the reception of settlers.
That emigrants shall be conveyed to New
South Wales in vessels taken up by the govern-
ment, and supplied with rations on the passage.
That the emigrants shall, upon their arrival
in the colony, be immediately put in possession
of the farms provided for them, and receive
such supplies from the government as will
enable them to proceed in the cultivation of
their farms.
That the actual cost of the whole, viz. the
clearing, fencing, and buildings on the farms,
the passage out, and supplies in the colony,
shall be repaid by the settler to the government,
with interest, by annual instalments, to com-
mence as soon as the settler’s farm shall be in such
a productive state as to enable him to do so.
An emigrant possessing 500/. will require no
assistance from the government, unless he ha* a


large family, but emigrants of less capital will-
I have made out estimates for three classes of
emigrants —those possessing 50/., those possess-
ing 100/., and those possessing 200/. ; and it
will he seen that the expense will, in the first
instance, not be great; that it will at no dis-
tant period be repaid ; and that the advantages
and savings resulting to the country will he
very considerable.
In the following estimates and computations
1 have been extremely particular and minute,
in order to shew what amount of capital will
be necessary to establish emigrants at New
South Wales, as well as the means in labour,
and other expences required to prepare farms.
From personal experience I know the means in
the colony, the rate of labour performed, and
the materials, &c. necessary for erecting houses
and clearing land ; and I have been careful to
ascertain the prices of the various articles to be
procured here. The scale of laboui is that
which has been always hitherto performed by
the convicts employed in the government works
and by the settlers ; the expense of freight and
passage out is the result of personal experience,
as well as the prices of all the othei aiticks
required. And I am persuaded, if any oi all
of them, or the like plans, be adopted, the la-
bour and expence will be found but a very small
matter, either under or over the estimates.


CLASS I.
Estimate of the expense of conveying and
establishing, as settlers at New South Wales,
one thousand families, supposing each family to
consist of man, wife, and two children, each
emigrant to possess a capital of 50/.
The government to give the emigrant and his
family a passage to New South Wales ; on his
arrival a farm of 60 acres, with a house erected
thereon, (24 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 8 feet
high, weather-boarded and shingled), one acre
of land cleared and fenced, with a pale fence
for a garden ; acres more cleared, and half
the farm fenced with a three rail fence ; also
one convict labourer, victualled and clothed by
the government for a year.
The emigrant to deposit with the govern-
ment in England his capital of 50/., for which
he shall receive in the colony, when on his
farm, the first year the value, at prime cost
English prices, in the specified supplies of pro-
visions, clothing, implements of husbandry,
seed, and live stock.
The settler to be charged by the government
with the cost of passage, farm, and crown or
convict servant, to be repaid with interest at
four per cent, by instalments of 20/. per year,
commencing the second year of his settlement


I suppose such an emigrant will have suffi-
cient furniture and clothing, without breaking
in on his capital, for use on the voyage, and
bedding, cooking utensils, earthenware, &c. for
use in the colony ; he will want and can procure
in the colony chairs, tables, bedsteads, &c.
In the estimates the labour is calculated ac-
cording to the quantities performed by the
convict labourers for the government and
settlers.
All materials and implements necessary to be
procured in England are estimated at the whole-
sale prices there.

As the convicts must be subsisted and superintended by the government,
whether employed or not, it is obvious the real expense to the government
of establishing these farms would not be more than 3,0001., and not even
that, as implements must be found for the convicts, at whatever labour
they may be employed.

I suppose the settler to be put in possession of his farm, as before desnbed,
in the month of June, and to have one government labourer assigned to
him- and that he and his labourer will perform the usual quantity of labour.
The general crops are maize, or Indian corn, planted from September to
December, ripe in April and May; wheal planted. March to May, reaped m
December. Barley and Rye, same period. The produce on new land
I “e, 30. wheat 20, barley and rye, 25 bushels per acre ,on stubble or 11-

When the farm is in full cultivation, the fourth year there will be, 7J mots

two children, each emigrant to possess 100/. capital.
The government to give the emigrant, and his
family, a passage to New South Wales; on his arrival
a farm of 100 acres, with a house erected thereon*
32 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 12 feet high, weather
boarded, shingled, a brick chimney, all the upper
rooms, and one ground floor room floored, ten acres
cleared and fenced with a three rail fence, and one
acre cleared and fenced with pales for a garden; also
one crown labourer, off the stores, that is to be fed
and clothed by the settler.
The emigrant in the first instance, to deposit with
the government 60/., to be repaid to him on his
arrival in the colony, the remaining 40/. to be laid
out by the emigrant in the purchase, in England, of
necessaries.
The settler to be charged by the government, with
the expense of his passage, and the farm prepared
for him, at the rate both actually cost, to be repaid
by him, with interest at four per cent, per annum,
by instalments of 201. a year, commencing the second
year of his settlement on his farm.

I suppose such an emigrant will have sufficient
furniture and clothing, without breaking in on his
capital, for use on the voyage, and bedding, cook-
ing utensils, tin, earthenware and glass ware, for use
in the colony. He will procure some furniture in
the colony, such as chairs, tables, bedsteads, &c.
The settler will in the second year of his settle-
ment, require an additional crown labourer, and will
consequently thence forward employ and subsist two
crown labourers.

It will be as necessary, and as politic, for the
government to give all reasonable protection
and encouragement to the colony produce, as to
the emigration of settlers; for unless the settlers
can dispose of their surplus produce, at remu-
nerating prices, they cannot afford to employ
and subsist the convicts or crown labourers.
All the supplies of grain and animal food, wanted
for his majesty’s magazines in the colony, should
certainly be bought from the settlers, atfair remu-
nerating prices : and as they can supply those
articles, of a better quality and at a cheaper
rate than they can be imported, there exists no
reason whatever, why they should not get the
preference in their own market. The colony
can grow more grain than it consumes, and
there is no regular certain market to export
the supplies to. The climate and soil are pecu-
liarly favourable to the production of tobacco,
flax, and hemp, articles for which there is de-
mand in the British market, to any extent they
can be produced. And consequently the culture
of them ought to be encouraged. For the pur-
pose of encouraging the growth of tobacco, a
high protecting duty of customs has been laid,
in the colony, on tobacco of foreign growth.
This will have the effect of causing a sufficient
quantity to be grown, for the consumption of
the colony. But as tobacco can be grown to
very considerable extent, for the British market,
e 2


it is to be hoped that the same wise policy applied
to New South Wales’ wool, of reducing the duty
for a term of years, until it shall be so improved
as to come in competition with foreign woo ,
will be also, in due time, extended to New South
Wales’ tobacco ; and that as soon as the co ony
shall be able to export it to the mother country,
a partial reduction of the excise duty will be
made, until it shall arrive at such a degree of
perfection, as to be able to compete with foreign
tobacco. And the same witli regard to hemp,
flax, and linseed. The government have already
with deserved consideration, and indeed m
accordance witli the interest of the mother
country, reduced the duty on New South Wales
wool, for ten years, to one penny per lb., and
placed the duty on timber, bark, and oil, on the
same footing with that of other colonies. But
they ought to be entirely repealed, to give the
more encouragement to the employment of the
convicts in procuring them.
It is I conceive, much to be regretted, that
the present government of New South Wales
have with, no doubt, the very proper view o
reducing the expences of the colony, adopted
some measures that will result, not in reducing,
but in very considerably encreasing those ex-
pences. It seems that contracts have been en-
tered into, for procuring salt meat from India,


for the government magazines, and indeed both
meat and flour of American produce, have been
purchased from American and other traders, when
there was no scarcity of either in the colony,
and at no reduction of price. A system has
also been adopted of reducing the price of the
colony produce, required for the government
magazine, (grain and meat) as low as possible.
I have resided for some years in New South
Wales, and I know that flour, grain, or pro-
visions of any kind, cannot be imported at a
less price than the colonist can afford to sell
them, yielding themselves a fair compensation.
The colonist can most assuredly supply his
majesty’s magazines, with beef at 3d., and pork
at 4d. per lb., and with wheat at 7 s, and maize
3s. 6d. per bushel, prices at which those articles
cannot be, and never will be imported. Now
convict labourers are employed in raising the
colony produce, and by reducing the consumption
of that produce you reduce, of course, in the
same degree employment for the convicts, and
the convicts thus thrown out of employment
will be returned by the settlers to the govern-
ment, and the expence of their subsistence
come on it. The purchase of supplies in a
foreign market so far reduces the consumption
of colony produce, and brings an increased ex-
pence upon the government. For instance, the
colonist will employ and subsist 10,000 convicts,


while the price of produce is remunerative as it
will be at 3 cl and 4 d. per lb. for meat, and Is.
and 3s. 6. per bushel for grain. By reducing
the prices the colonists will employ only so
much labour as will grow produce for their
own consumption, and as the number of free
labourers is now considerable, and several set-
tlers with small farms employ crown labourers
only to grow produce for sale, there is no doubt
that one half the number of convicts now em-
ployed by the settlers will be thrown out of
employment and returned to the government,
and an expence incurred equal to the subsist-
ence of five thousand convicts, at least 70,000/.
per annum ; besides the entire stop put by this
discouraging system to the future employment
of convicts by the settlers. The matter then is re-
duced to this simple question : —"Will the saving
in the price of foreign supplies more than meet
and cover this increased expence? I have no
hesitation in asserting, that no person will, for
one moment, pretend to say that it will. And
if it will not, this notable attempt at saving, by
reducing the colony produce below a remu-
nerating price, will end in very considerably in-
creasing the expences of the colony. In the
year 1821 there were upwards of 20,000 con-
victs in New South Wales *, and the bills diawn
in that year by the commissary, for the sub-
sistence of those convicts, and of the civil, naval


and military establishments, at least 2,000 per-
sons more, amounted to 207,050/. sterling. How
came so many persons to be subsisted at so
little expense ? Because the greater part of the
convicts were employed and subsisted by the
settlers. The prices they received for their
produce enabled them to employ and subsist so
many. By reducing the prices the government
may possibly obtain supplies a little cheaper in
detail, and for a short time, but the quantity
required will be considerably increased, and so
will the aggregate expence.
If this system be persevered in, the expence
of New South Wales to this country will
soon be doubled, emigration thereto entirely
stopped, the best means of employing the con-
victs destroyed, and all the evils of having the
convicts congregated in large bodies, and with-
out employment, will be sure to follow. I again
and again repeat, that the best and only possible
way of making New South Wales what a penal
settlement should be, a school of correction and
reform, , is by finding agricultural employment
for the convicts, and this can be best done by
assigning them to settlers; therefore not only
ought the increase of settlers to be encouraged,
but also the colony produce, so as to enable the
settler to employ and subsist the convict. The
government of New South Wales, instead of


grasping at and pluming itself upon every
little present and temporary paltry saving of
pence or shillings, ought to consider the subject
with large and liberal views. An estimate
should be made, from a consideration of the
capital necessary to carry on agricultural pur-
suits and the wages of labour, of the fair remu-
nerating price at which the settler could afford
his produce to the government, and that price
should be given, even were it considerably
higher than the foreign market •, whereas, in
fact, it would not be higher; for I again contend
that the colonists can afford their produce at a
remunerating price, cheaper and of a better
quality than can be imported.
The settler should not only get a remunerat-
ing price for the produce required for the
supply of his majesty’s magazines in the colony,
but a regular system of protection for other
colony produce should be adopted both in the
colony and in England. The colony revenue
is now considerably more than the purposes for
which it was established, and to which it is
legally applicable, require. A part of the sur-
plus colony revenue could not be better applied
than in bounties for the growth and exportation
to England of fine wool, tobacco, flax, linseed,
hemp, timber, bark, hides, oil, &c. (these are all
bulky articles, the distance they have to be


conveyed is great, and the freight high, and
something ought to be done to lighten that ex-
pence.) The means of employing the convicts,
and the saving of expence to the country, would
thereby be very considerably increased, and the
colony and colonists benefited. In short, Sir,
by every way in which the means and resources
of the colony and colonists of New South Wales
can be improved, will employment be increased
for the convicts, their punishment and reform
be the better effected, the expence of their
subsistence and superintendence be reduced,
and New South Wales, as a penal settlement*
be every way improved.


THIRD LETTER.
Sir,
In my former letter on New South Wales, as
a penal settlement, I stated that it possessed
peculiar advantages, such as to render it the
best adapted of any of his majesty’s colonies for
the reception, employment, and support of that
immense mass of pauper population which
presses so heavily on the resources and in-
dustry of the country ; and where every able-
bodied labouring pauper in England and his
family may be established as an independent
freeholder, with eventually no expence to the
nation, and with the certainty of gradually, and
at no very distant period, finally extinguishing
pauperism and poor rates. And I now proceed,
Sir, to submit the same to your consideration.
At this time it is almost superfluous, after the
light that has been thrown on, and the serious
evils that have been felt to arise from the state
of pauperism and system of relief and assess-
ment of poor rates in England, to enter at any
length into that subject. The committee of
parliament, 1817, in their report stale, “ That
the system is perpetually encouraging and in-
creasing the amount of misery it was designed
to alleviate, and at the same time creating an


unlimited demand upon funds which it cannot
augment. That it produced the very necessity
it was created to relieve, as it obviously tended
to reduce the wages of labour to the immediate
and direct prejudice of the labouring classes;
and that in fact the law of relief, while it pro-
posed to compel both labour and wages to be
provided, in reality effected nothing but a more
wasteful application of the diminished capital
than would otherwise have taken place, and tended
thereby to reduce the wages of free labour.
That as a system of relief founded upon com-
pulsory enactments, it was divested of the cha-
racter of benevolence, and was without its
beneficial effects; that as it proceeded from no
impulse of charity it created no feelings of grati-
tude, and not unfrequently engendered dispo-
sitions and habits calculated to separate rather
than unite the interests of the higher and the
lower orders of the community ; that even the
obligations of natural affection were no longer
left to their own impulse, but the mutual support
of the nearest relatives had been enjoined by a
positive law, which the authority of the magis-
trate was continually required to enforce. That
it appeared to have been not only highly preju-
dicial to the moral habits and consequent hap-
piness of a great body of people, who had been
reduced to the degradation of a dependance
upon parochial support, but the whole com


munity, and particularly the most industrious
classes, had been oppressed by a weight of
contribution taken from those very means which
would otherwise have been more beneficially
applied to the supply of employment; and that
to a degree calculated to perpetuate evils that
would otherwise be transient, but w 7 hich would
now permanently derange the whole industry
of the country.”
The parliamentary committee of 1819, having
entirely concurred in the views of the com-
mittee of 1817, further observes, “ That if by
any human institution the present wants of life
are to be obtained otherwise than by human
exertion, the very sources of all industry must be
destroyed; that it becomes matter of calculation
to the labourer, whether the money necessary
for his maintenance be derived from the wages
of labour, or the alms of the parish. That the
motive that would naturally impel men to action
and faithful service is wanting; and that, in fact,
the amount of regular labour had been greatly
diminished, and its quantity materially impaired.”
After such an enumeration of the evil effects
of the system of compulsory relief, as existing
in England, in the creation of immoral habits
in the people, the depression of industry, the
promotion of idleness, the too great reduction


of the fair wages of labour, and the increase of
the very mischiefs, pauperism and misery, it
was intended to alleviate and prevent; it is
not to be wondered that both committees “ felt
it their imperious duty to state to the house
their opinion, that unless some efficacious check
be interposed, there is every reason to think
that the amount of assessment will continue, as
it has done, on the whole to increase, till at a
period more or less remote it shall have absorbed
the profits of the property on which the rate
may have been assessed, producing thereby the
neglect and ruin of the land, the waste or re-
moval of other property, and the permanent de-
rangement of the whole industry of the country,
to the utter subversion of that happy order of
society so long upheld in these kingdoms. ,,
The increase of pauperism and poor’s rate has
been very great and remarkable during the last
half century, the sums expended in the relief
of the poor having increased from 1,521,732/.
in the year 1776 1° 7*890,148/. in the year
1817-18. And although in consequence of
plentiful harvests, cheap provisions, and general
improvement in the condition of the labouring
classes throughout the country, the expenditure
has been decreasing from 1817-18 to 1821-22,
when it amounted only to 6,358,703/. ; yet,
taking triennial averages of the amount of rate


and price of wheat, (which were, the three *
years ending 25th March, 1814, 1815, 1816,
poor's rate, 5,812,645, price of wheat, yds. B d.
per quarter; the three years ending 25th
March 1817,1818, 1819, poor’s rate, 7,446,672/-
price of wheat, 865. lOd. per quarter ; and the
three years ending 25th March 1820, 1821,
1822, poor’s rate, 6,882,247/., and price of
wheat, 61s. 11 d. per quarter,) it will probably
be concluded that no real decrease of pau-
perism or of rate has as yet taken place, inas-
much as the difference in the price of food more
than accounts for the difference in the amount
of rate, the decrease in the former being 38
per cent., and in the latter little more than 8
per cent. It is therefore at this time fail to
conclude as the parliamentary committee con-
cluded, Report, page 6, “ that independent of
the pressure of any temporary or accidental
circumstances, and making every allowance foi
increased population, the rise in the price of
provisions and other necessaries of life, it ap-
peared that both the number of paupers and
the amount of money levied by assessments were
progressively increasing, while the situation of
the poor appeared not to have been in any cor-
responding degree improved.” And the com-
mittee were further of opinion, that whilst
the existing poor laws, and the system under
which they are administered remain unchanged,


does not exist any power of arresting the
progress of this increase, till it shall no longer
be found possible to augment the sums raised
by assessment.
With such views of this most important sub-
ject, in which every succeeding committee of
parliament concurred, the committee of 1817
examined a variety of plans and suggestions,
professing to meet, and in some measure to
remedy, the evils of the existing system ; and
upon the whole they were not able to suggest
or point out any plan that could do more than
effect a very partial benefit. They recommended
the establishment of parochial benefit societies,
parochial schools, select vestries, alterations in
the law of settlement, discontinuance of relief
in aid of wages, apportioning relief according
to the number of children between certain asres,
o 7
and finally, emigration. Laws were made to
carry some of these measures into operation,
and the result has not issued in any perceptible
diminution of pauperism or rate. Some of
them, the discontinuance of relief in aid of
wages, and apportioning relief according to
the number of children between certain ages,
have not been tried, nor indeed can they be
resorted to at all under the existing state of
pauperism. And of all the measures suggested
by the committee, emigration is the only prac


ticable one that has not, upon any
extensive scale, been tried or adopted.
The committee of 1819 state in their Report,
pages 8,9, “ That the market for labour is in
many parts of the kingdom at present much
overstocked, does not admit of dispute ; nor
does your committee believe, that in other parts
the demand is greater than the supply; it is
not probable, therefore, that even the entire and
immediate removal of all present impediments,
if it were practicable, would of itself at this
moment cure the existing evil. Other mea-
sures, assisted by the unrestrained operation of
natural causes, will yet be wanting to bring the
kingdom, in this respect, to its ordinary and
healthful state. Your committee must there-
fore recur to the opinion expressed in the for-
mer report, “ That all obstacles to seeking
employment, wherever it can be found, even out
of the realm, should be removed, and every
facility that is reasonable afforded to those who
may wish to resort to our own colonies for it
seems not unnatural, that this country should,
at such a time, recur to an expedient which has
been adopted successfully in other times, and
in other countries, especially as it has facilities
for this purpose, which perhaps no other state
has ever enjoyed to the same extent, by the
possession of colonies affording an extent of


unoccupied territory, in which the labour of
man, assisted by a genial and healthy climate,
would produce an early and abundant return.”
If it be true, as I apprehend must be admit-
ted, that pauperism principally arises from a re-
dundant labouring population, it is evident that
nothing can remove it but the reduction of that
redundancy ; and that it is so, appears from this
fact, that now in the year 1823, in the eighth year
of peace, with an acknowledged state of general
prosperity and improvement in our commerce,
manufactures, and agriculture, with plentiful
harvests and cheap bread, there has still been
no material reduction effected in the amount of
rate assessed and expended in the relief of the
poor ; and if that amount be compared with
the price of bread, there has been no reduction
whatever, but an increase. In order therefore
to remove pauperism and reduce the poor’s rate,
the redundant population must be reduced.
This can only be done by emigration, and that
to an extent commensurate with the redun-
dancy.
The emigration of the surplus labouring po-
pulation of England, consisting, as will appear,
of several hundred thousand souls, is a matter
of the most serious importance, as it respects
the labouring part of the community, and the
F


prosperity of the state ; as well as in reference
to the sources and funds from which the ex-
pence can be derived; the country to which
it will be prudent and practicable to remove
them j and the benefit to the individuals them-
selves.
It is true that one experiment in emigration has
been made, viz. to the Cape of Good Hope, and
has failed, but it failed from natural causes, an
unfruitful soil, and an unfavorable climate ; the
one being unfit for agricultural purposes, to any
profit, and the other a succession of seasons of
drought; circumstances that might have been
known, and that ought to have prevented that
particular colony from being selected as the
fittest place to send emigrants to. If the same
persons had been sent to New South Wales, or
Van Diemen’s Land, which might have been
done at a very trifling additional expence of
freight, how different would have been the re-
sult. And therefore the failure of this experi-
ment cannot be reasonably considered as a good
argument against a system of emigration, when
directed to a different colony, where none of the
causes that produced that failure exist.
I shall now proceed to point out the cir-
cumstances in New South Wales, and Van
Diemen’s Land which make these colonies


the most fit of any in the possession of the crown
for the reception of poor emigrants upon a large
scale ; that description of persons of whom
the labouring population of England is com-
posed.
The first requisite in any country, and more
especially in a new colony, is a good climate. In
this particular, New South Wales, in which I
always include Van Diemen’s Land, is in no re-
spect inferior to any other country in the world.
We have now had the experience of five-and-
thirty years, and it serves to shew, not only that
the climate is most congenial to the human con-
stitution in preserving health, but that old and
unhealthy persons have recovered and preserved
a state of health seldom to be found in other
countries. It is a well ascertained fact that in-
flammatory and febrile diseases have not hitherto
been observed in New South Wales. There is
no trace to be found of the diseases that prevail
in the back woods of America. And as to those
fatal diseases of children, small-pox, measles and
hooping-cough, not one single case has been
known to exist. The climate is equally favorable
for all domestic animals. Horned cattle, horses,
sheep, swine, and every description of poultry
thrive and multiply to a degree I believe seldom
known, certainly never exceeded elsewhere. In
short with respect to climate, there is not a
f 2


healthier or finer in the world, for man or beast,
than that of New South Wales.
The next requisite for a colony of emigrants
is a fruitful soil; and in this also New South
Wales is certainly not inferior to any other co-
lony. It would be too tedious, Sir, to occupy
your time with a minute description of the
variety of soil and productions of this colony;
and I shall therefore merely observe, that it
contains numerous and extensive tracts of land,
even in the very small portion of that vast
country that has been explored, naturally
so rich and productive, as to yield abundant
crops of wheat, maize, and barley, in some
places for thirty, and in other for twenty,
and for fifteen successive years, without
manure and without rest. The quantity of
similar land, contained in that small section
of New South Wales, extending from Jervis
Bay, lat. 35, south, to Port Macquarie, lat. 31,
following that parallel inland to 148° of east
longitude, from thence to Macquarie River,
and up that river to its source, containing
upwards of 60,000 square miles, is sufficient
to afford, not only subsistence, but a farm to
every family of the surplus labouring population
of England and Ireland; a section of country
in which also are contained the harbours of Port
Jackson, Broken Bay, Botany Bay, Jervis Bay,


Bateman’s Bay, Port Hunter, Port Stephen,
and Port Macquarie, and the rivers Hawkes-
bury, Hunter, Hastings, and Clyde, discharg-
ing themselves into the ocean, and the Lach-
lane, and Macquarie, running several hundred
miles inland. I have made an estimate of the
quantity of good land, fit for agricultural pur-
poses, the growth of grain, hemp, flax, and
tobacco, contained in the line of country ex-
plored by Mr. Surveyor General Oxley, in his
expeditions into the interior, in the years 1817
and 1818, and the result is, that it forms a
square area of 250 miles every way, or 62,500
square miles, and 40,000,000 acres, and con-
tains, at least, ten million acres of land upon the
banks of rivers and streams, well watered, rich,
fertile, and valuable for all purposes of grazing,
cultivation, and settlement, and capable of pro-
ducing in the greatest abundance, wheat, barley,
oats, Indian corn, tobacco, flax, and hemp, and
of rearing and feeding horned cattle, horses, and
fine wooled sheep without number. A country
certainly sufficient in point of extent and fertility
of soil, for the reception of all the redundant
population of Great Britain and Ireland.
But there is another most important parti-
cular in which the colony of New South Wales
excels every other British colony for poor emi-
grants, to which I beg leave, Sir, to call your


particular attention, and that is the immense
means the government possesses there, in the
article of the convicts’ labour properly applied.
It is necessary in every newly settled country,
to incur very considerable expence and labour in
clearing the land, erecting houses, and procur-
ing live stock, before subsistence can be obtained
from the produce of the soil. This expence
poor emigrants cannot afford, neither have they
any means of procuring subsistence, while they
may be preparing the land for their future sup-
port ; so that emigration is entirely out of their
power while confined to their own resources;
and if the redundant labouring population of
England, be left to itself to emigrate, it never
can do so for want of means. Now in the colony
of New South Wales, there are at this present
time, 1823, upwards of twenty thousand male
convicts, able bodied crown labourers, of these
ten thousand is quite a sufficient number to be
distributed among the settlers in the colony, and
employed in the government works, and the re-
maining ten thousand labourers are ready on the
spot to be employed in clearing and preparing
land for emigrants. As it is important to shew
the number of labourers in New South Wales,
at the disposal of the government, I will just
state how the matter stands.
At the colonial muster, or census of 1821, the


number of male convicts was found to be 16,210,
of those there were distributed among and em.
ployed by the colonists in every way 6927, and
1,378 held ‘‘tickets of leave,” leaving at the
disposal of the government 7,905 labourers.
Since that period, upwards of 3,500 male con-
victs have been sent out, and there are now
therefore upwards of 10,000 crown labourers,
who really are in a measure, in want of employ-
ment, in the colony. It is to be observed that
the government has to feed, clothe, and lodge all
the convicts not distributed among the colonists.
Now if those 10,000 crown labourers, or even a
part of them, were employed in clearing and
fencing farms, and erecting houses on them,
they would clear and fence a sufficient quantity
of land every year, for several thousand farms,
and besides erect a house on each farm. By
the following estimate, it appears that 5500
labourers will every year prepare 5000 farms,
on each of which shall be erected a good house*
and a sufficient portion of land cleared, fenced
and fitted for immediate cultivation, adapted for
the immediate reception and comfortable settle-
ment of a labouring family.


ESTIMATE A.
Estimate of the labour and materials required
to prepare five thousand farms, each farm to
contain thirty acres of land, fenced with a
three-rail fence, one acre cleared and fenced
for a garden, five acres cleared to cultivate, and
a house, 24 feet long, 12 feet wide, and eight
feet high, weather-boarded and shingled, erected
thereon.
The labour estimated according to the scale
of labour performed by the convict labourers

Inasmuch as the government must subsist all

tenance and superintendence of the convicts to
be employed in preparing these farms, should
be considered as an additional expence to the
crown to be charged against the pauper emi-
grants, or the fund upon which they may be
sent out. But if it should be considered as a

It is obvious the real expence, per farm, will
be only 3/, the cost of implements and mate


rials; and indeed, to speak more correctly, the
real expence the government would incur, in
the preparing of these five thousand farms,
would be the bare cost of materials bought in
England, being, as above, only 3,000/. or 13s.
4, d . per farm, inasmuch as the convicts em-
ployed in preparing the farms must be subsisted
at all events, and implements must be provided
for them, whatever labour they may be put to.
This estimate clearly shews that the govern-
ment possesses in New South Wales the means,
at very small additional expence indeed, 3,000/.,
of preparing annually comfortable farms and
houses for no less than five thousand labouring
families. I say at a very small additional ex-
pence, for the expence of maintaining the con-
vict labourers is now, and must continue to be,
borne by the government, whether employment
be found for them or not: and employing the
convicts in this way would be nothing more
than profitably applying to national purposes
that mass of labour which is at command. The
convicts employed in preparing these farms will
require neither more food, clothing, or super-
intendence than they now require. There is
no difficulty in the labour to be performed, as
the greater part is of the most common and
ordinary kind; and it is all of that description
that the quantity a man can and ought to per


form is capable of being ascertained, and has
been fixed for years in the colony ; obviously a
particular advantage in compulsory labour, in-
asmuch as the labourer, however disposed to
idleness, must perform the regulated quantity.
Sawing, shingle splitting, brick-making and
fencing, can be quickly learned and easily per-
formed by any handy man, and are daily
acquired by persons in New South Wales who
never laboured at them before. A sufficient
number of the only persons I would call me-
chanics, rough carpenters and bricklayers, can
easily be procured from among the convicts.
In short it is quite clear, that from among
upwards of twenty thousand men, of every trade
and calling, a sufficient number of every de-
scription of labourer and mechanic necessary
for this purpose can be procured. And there
is besides this other advantage resulting to the
convicts themselves in their reformation, and
the general interests of the colony as well as the
state, that the men employed in this descrip-
tion of labour will be trained to become useful
labourers and settlers themselves when they
become free; they will acquire habits of indus-
try and labour in the very particulars in which
both will be necessary and useful for themselves
thereafter. In a word, the employment of the
convicts in this way would be a school of cor-
rection, hard healthy labour, and of industry


for them ; and afford the government the means
of providing, at no expence to itself, and with
great advantage to the emigrant, for the emi-
gration gradually and in due time of the redun-
dant labouring population of England.
My object in this letter being to submit to
your consideration, Sir, a plan by which I con-
ceive the redundant labouring population of
England may be enabled to emigrate to New
South Wales, with advantage to themselves,
benefit to the state, and to the final extinction
of poor’s rate ; and it being, I think, shewn
that the government possesses in that colony
a countrv abounding with rich and valuable
land, and abundant means to put it in a state
fit for the reception of poor emigrants ; I shall
now proceed to shew to what extent emigration
should be carried ; the expence, and the funds
from which that expence should be derived,
and the extent to which pauperism and poor’s
rate will be thereby diminished.
In order to arrive at some idea of the extent
to which emigration should be carried, it be-
comes necessary to ascertain, as nearly as pos-
sible, the number of the redundant labouring
population ; for the number to emigrate should
be such, as not only to prevent an increase in,
but gradually to carry off that redundance, and


reduce the labouring population to its just and
sound limits ; something of an equality between
the supply and demand, between the labouring
population and such employment as will afford
it a living wages.
When the supply and demand for labour is
equal or nearly equal, the wages of labour
ought to be, and indeed will be sufficient to
maintain the labourer and his family. But if
the wages of labour be not sufficient for the sub-
sistence of the labourer, either by reason of
excess in the supply of labour and consequent
over competition and reduced wages ;or by
reason of the inadequacy of the funds from
which the labour of wages is derived (both of
which causes operate in England,) the labourer
must come to some other fund for his deficient
subsistence, and that fund is the poor’s rate.
The amount of poor’s rate, therefore, will be-
come the best criterion and datum by which
to ascertain the redundant labouring popula-
tion ; for the extent of that redundance is
exactly the number which, making allowance
for aged and impotent poor, and over-compe-
tition, the poor’s rate will wholly subsist through-
out the year.

is given only for the years ending Easter 1803,
1813, 1814, and 1815.* In those years the
amount expended in relief of the poor, and the
number of persons relieved, and the average
price of wheat, was as follows :
Children are not included, and the amount ex-
pended was actually paid as relief, and did not
include the expence of removals, salaries,
law, &c.
In the years 1812-13, and 1813-14, the price
of provisions was so high as evidently to increase
considerably the number of persons coming on
the rate for relief, and those years are therefore
not fit to be taken as a general criterion. The
years 1802-3 and 1814-15, were on the con-
trary years of average cheapness as to provi-
sions, the average of the price of wheat for those
two years being nearly the same as the average
* See Poor Abstracts, April 20, 1818.


of 1820 and 1821; the former 66.9.9 d. the latter
655. 11 d. per quarter. I therefore take the
average of the years 1802-3 and 1814-15, as
coming the nearest, in respect of the price of
provisions, to the present time, and to what may
be considered as the average of ordinary years.
The number of persons who received relief
from the rate (average of 1802-3 and 1814-15,)
was thus; — Permanently relieved in work-
houses, 85,010 ; permanently relieved out of
workhouses, 345,350; occasionally relieved,
341,517. Now it is evident those persons did
not receive relief equal to their entire subsist-
ence during the period relief was afforded them,
much less throughout the year. The greater
number of those described as (C permanently
relieved in workhouses,” were perhaps entirely
subsisted throughout the year from the rate;
some, but not many, of those “ permanently
relieved out of workhouse,” were also sub-
sisted entirely from the rate, but certainly the
far greater part received only partial subsist-
ence from that fund, and none of those “ occa-
sionally” relieved were wholly subsisted even
during the period they received relief; for the
great majority of persons “ relieved out of
workhouse,” and “ occasionally relieved,” re-
ceived such relief in aid of wages or other means
of subsistence. I therefore assume


That those “ permanently relieved
in workhouses ” were wholly sub- Persons.
sisted throughout the year - - 86,010
That those ** permanently relieved out
of workhouses” received relief equal
to one-half their subsistence through-
out the year, which would be equal
to entire subsistence for half the
number, or - 172,676
That those u occasionally relieved”
received relief equal to one-fourth
their subsistence throughout the
year, or to one-half their subsistence
for half the year, which would be
-equal to entire subsistence through-
out the year for one-fourth the
number, or - - 83,379
Total, equal to entire subsistence throughout
the year for 343,064 adults. The amount of
rate applied to the relief of the poor, average
of the years 1802-3 and 1814-15, was 4,748,368/.
sterling. The actual amount of rate ex-
pended in relief of the poor in 1814-15, was
6,418,846/., and it regularly increased to
7,890,148/. in the year 1817-18, and again gra-
dually declined to 6,368,703/. in the year 1821-
22. The average price of wheat in the former
period, 1802-3 and 1814-15 was, as before ob-
G


served, very little above the average prices of
1820 and 1821 ; and making every allowance
for the small difference in the price of provi-
sions, I think I may conclude that the number
of persons relieved from the rate is relatively
as great now as it was in the years 1803 and
1815.
If the expence of subsistence be nearly the
same as in 1803 and 1815, the number of adults,
with their families, which the amount of rate
paid in relief in 1822 would have wholly sub-
sisted throughout the year, would have been
459,408 ; but if the average of the three most
favourable years of the last twenty-five, 1803,
1815 and 1822, be deemed as coming nearer to
the truth, it will give the number of adults as
401,236. And as it appears from the Popula-
tion Returns of 1821, made to parliament,* that
the relative proportion of persons in every one
hundred of the population is forty-nine under
twenty years of age, and fifty-one upwards of
twenty years of age, there will be 385,501 chil-
dren and persons under twenty years of age,
making the number which the poor’s rate will
wholly subsist throughout the year, adults and
children, 786,737 souls. And if one-eighth be
allowed for aged and impotent poor, there will
* See Enumeration and Population Abstracts, July 2, 1822.


remain 688,355 persons, or 140,481 families (at
4to persons each family, that being the average
of the families of England and Wales,) subsisted
by poor’s rates, who ought to be subsisted by
the wages of labour.
Two principal causes concur in compelling
the labouring population to come on the rate
for subsistence, the inadequacy of the fund
from which the wages of labour is derived ; and
the reduction of wages of labour by reason of
an excessive supply. The former cause is cer-
tainly the principal one, the latter is but a con-
sequence of the former. If we could discover
the precise degree in which each operates, we
could then ascertain the exact excess of the
labouring population ; for in the same propor-
tion as the fund, from which the wages of labour
is derived, is inadequate to the subsistence of
the labouring population, is that population ex-
cessive ? (By excessive labouring population,
1 would be always understood to mean such a
population as the wages of labour will not main-
tain.) There are, however, no data by which
we can arrive at this discovery, and we can
only form a conjecture, perhaps not very wide
of the truth, that the former of these two causes
operates to double the extent of the latter; that
is, that the fund from which the wages of labour
is derived is inadequate to the subsistence of
g 2


the labouring population by 93,654 families,
containing 458,903 souls, and an expence, to-
other funds, in the shape of poor’s rate, of
3,277,890/.; and that the excessive supply of
labourers produces an over-competition and
consequent reduction in the wages of labour
below its fair rate, so as to bring on the late an
expence equal to the subsistence of 46,287 fami-
lies, containing 229,452 souls, and amounting
to sterling.
Although it may not be practicable for the
entire, or any very considerable part of the
estimated redundant families to emigrate at
once, or in a very short period of time, yet it
is necessary that such a number shall emigrate
as will gradually carry off all the redundant
population ; and in order to do so, the numbei
should annually be, at least, so much greater
than the annual increase of that redundance,
as not only to keep it down, but to reduce and
finally carry it off. Now the average of annual
births in England and Wales is as “ one in eveiy
thirty-five,” and of deaths, as “ one in every
forty-eight” of the population ; there will be in
the estimated redundant population of 458,903
souls 13,111 births and 7,912 deaths annually,
and the difference, 5,199, will be the annual
increase. Supposing, therefore, five thousand
families, consisting of 25,000 souls, to emigrate


annually, it will not only carry off the current
increase, but the whole redundant population in
twenty-six years, and therefore I fix upon that
as the most convenient and expedient number
of families to emigrate annually.
I have now to shew the expence of the annual
emigration of five thousand families to New
South Wales, and. of their settlement there ;
and the sources from whence I propose to de-
rive the funds to defray that expence.
I propose them to derive the fund, for defray-
ing the expence from two sources ; first from
the poor’s rate, and next from annual rents to
be paid by the emigrants for their farms, com-
mencing within a certain period after their
settlement on them. And my plan is, that the
contribution from the poor’s rate, shall be 10/.
per annum, for fourteen years, for every
man, wife, and three children, of five persons
emigrating : and the annual rent to be paid by
each emigrant settler, shall be also 10/. com-
mencing the third year of his settlement. It
appearing from estimate D, that he will be well
able at that period, to commence the payment
of such a rent.
In the following estimates, B and C. I sup-
pose the emigrants to be paupers; and that it


will be necessary to give them a passage out,
and to find them provisions, ship furniture, and
clothing for the voyage ; and to supply them in
the colony, on their farms, with rations and
clothing, until they can, from the produce of
their farms, maintain themselves ; and also with
household furniture, implements of agriculture,
seed, and live stock sufficient to enable them to
commence and profitably cultivate their lands.
Estimate D, shews in what period of time the
labouring emigrant can bring his farm into a state
of cultivation, his annual expences and returns,
and the rest he can afford to pay thereout. I
suppose the various articles to be purchased at
wholesale ready money prices, and the duties
of customs and excise, on every article subject
thereto, to be drawn back as upon exportation.
Estimate B, shews the supplies necessary for
and the expence of the voyage out. Estimate
C, shews the supplies necessary for and the ex-
pences of the emigrant, when on his farm in
the colony. And estimate D, shews the period
of time in which he can bring his farm into pro>-
ductive cultivation.

Estimate of the expence of conveying pau-
per emigrants to New South Wales, calculating


each family to consist of man, wife, and three chil-
dren, and to be supplied with rations, bedding,
clothing, and all other necessaries for the voyage.

ESTIMATE D.
Computation and estimate of the period of time,
in which the labouring emigrant settler can bring
his land into a state of productive cultivation, with
the quantity of produce and value ; as well as the
rental he can alford to pay thereout, by way of
return, for the expence of his conveyance and
settlement.
I suppose the settler to be put in possession of a
farm, containing thirty acres of land, surrounded
with a three rail and post fence ; whereon a
house is erected ; five acres of the land cleared and
fit to commence cultivating ; and a garden of one
acre also cleared and fenced ; and to enter on his
farm between the first of April, and the first of
July.
The mode of labour with the hoe, and axe, being
what the emigrant is unaccustomed to. I suppose
him to perform no greater quantity of labour the first
year, than what the convicts perform for the crown,
working only five days in the week, from six o’clock
in the morning, to three in the afternoon each day ;
after the first year he will be fully able to perform
the usual quantity of labour performed in the
colony.
The general crops are maize, or Indian corn,
wheat, rye, barley. Maise is planted, October,

I have now to shew the relief that will accrue
to the poors’ rate from the emigration of such
paupers : now, in order to estimate this, it be-
comes necessary in the first place to ascertain
the amount of the rate which, upon an average
of the whole kingdom, it will take wholly to
subsist throughout the year a labouring pauper
family, consisting of the general average num-
ber of persons; and in the next place, the
wages of labour which such a family, if fully
employed would earn ; for, as will be shewn,
the amount of relief to the rate will be the
mean, or average, of those two sums, whatever
they may be, less the amount of contribution to
the emigration fund.
With respect to the amount of rate then. It
has been seen, that upon an average of the two
years in the last twenty five, 1803 and 1815,
wherein the amount of rate and the price of


wheat was lowest, and the amount of rate ex-
pended in relief of the poor was sufficient wholly
to subsist throughout the year 343,064 adults,
added to which the proportion of children 4f,
329,612 makes 672,676 souls ; or, at 4 X V per-
sons each family 137,281 families. The amount
expended, average of the same years was
4,748,368/. sterling, giving for each family
34/. 11s. 9 *d. And I do conclude that the cost
of wholly subsisting such a family, five persons,
throughout the year by poors’ rate is not now,
nor is it likely in future to be, less than that
sum ; the average price of wheat during the
year calculated on being 665. 9 d. per quarter,
and for the last two years, 1821 and 1822,
by 655. 11 d. per quarter.
With respect to the wages of labour.—lt is
evident that the fund available for the wages of
labour is not sufficient to afford subsistence to
the whole labouring population, and the de-
ficiency is made up by assessment or rate. Any
part of that population withdrawn makes room
for an equal number to be employed, and to
receive subsistence to that extent from the
wages of the labour fund; and to the same
extent relieves the rate from their subsistence.
Every labourer and his family emigrating, al-
though he may not have received, nor be likely
to claim, any relief from the rate, will, by the


vacancy lie creates in the supply of labour,
make room for the employment of an equal
quantity of now unemployed labour, and the rate
will be as effectually relieved thereby as if the
pauper actually receiving relief had emigrated.
If a labourer, not a pauper emigrates, the rate is
relieved to the extent of the wages of his labour,
or nearly. It a pauper labourer emigrates, the
rate is relieved to no greater extent than in the
former case; for the amount of his wages paid out
of the wages fund, together with the sum he re-
ceives from the rate, is the measure of relief the
rate will receive; and both those amounts will
not exceed, nor indeed equal, the wages of the
non pauper labourer; inasmuch as the sub-
sistence, or income, received in the shape of
rate, is never equal to that obtained as the
wages of labour. It is, therefore, clear that the
emigration of non pauper labourers, or of in part
pauper labourers, or of wholly pauper labourers
and their families, will all equally relieve the
rates, not only to the extent to which they re-
ceive subsistence from it, but also to the extent
nearly of the wages of labour which they receive
or earn. I say nearly ; for, as before observed,
the subsistence afforded by the rate is always
more scanty, and therefore less expensive than
that from wages. A family in full employment
will earn and spend in subsistence a greater
H


sum than a family out of employ and subsisted
by the rate can, or will be allowed. I therefore
conclude, that the actual relief which will be
afforded the poors' rate by the emigration of a
labouring family will be the mean or average,
of the amount of wages such a family would
earn, and the amount of rate it would take
wdiolly to subsist such a family as paupers.
The average numbers, ages, and sexes of
families in England and Wales, as appears by
the population returns of 1821, for any forty
families, of one hundred and ninety-six persons,
is as follows : fifty-five persons, i.e, twenty-eight
males and twenty-seven females, under ten years
of age; twenty-two persons, eleven males and
eleven females, between ten and fifteen years
of age; nineteen persons, nine males and ten
females, between fifteen and twenty years of
age; seventy-three persons, thirty-five males
and thirty-eight females, between twenty and
fifty years ages ; twelve persons, six males and
six females, between fifty and sixty years of
age; and fifteen persons, eight males and seven
females, sixty years and upwards. The average
wages of labour of England and Wales, is, I
think, considerably underrated in the following
estimate for forty families, consisting of one
hundred and ninety-six persons.

Average expence of subsisting such a family by poor’s
rate, would be, as before seen . , £34 H9^
The mean or average of which two sums of
45/., nearly, will be about the amount of annual
relief the rate would receive by the emigration
of every family of labourers. However, in
order to be within the truth, rather than with-
out it, I calculate in the estimates upon the
amount of relief to the poors’ rate, at only 40/.
per annum, for every family of five persons emi-
grating, from which, deducting the contribution
of 10/. per annum to the emigration fund, the
remainder, or 30/. per annum for every family
emigrating will be the amount of permanent relief
and reduction that will take place in the rate.
The following is a sketch of the principles
upon which this plan of pauper emigration
might be conducted, as to the selection of the
emigrants, and management of the finds.
h 2


1. That the families to emigrate shall be
selected from every parish in England and
Wales, in the same proportion to the number
of paupers in each parish, that the whole num-
ber of families annually emigrating bear to the
whole number of paupers in England; and
where the number of paupers in any parish is
not such as to entitle it to supply one family of
emigrants, two or more parishes shall be united
for that purpose.
2. That in the first instance it shall be left
to the requisite number of families from each
parish to volunteer to emigrate; and if the re-
quisite number shall not volunteer they shall
be ballotted for; and any person selected by
ballot and refusing to emigrate, shall, with his
wife and children, be for ever incapable of re-
ceiving parochial relief in any part of England
or Wales.
3. That every family emigrating shall consist
of an able bodied, healthy, married labourer, me-
chanic, or artizan, having a wife, and, at least,
two children: it being understood that none
will be received but able bodied labouring men
having families.
4. That a contribution of 10/. per annum, for
fourteen years, shall be paid from the poors* rate


to the emigration fund for every family of five
persons, man, wife, and three children emi-
grating 5 and be applied in discharge of the
expence of the conveyance and settlement of
the emigrants at New South Wales.
5. That each emigrant shall pay a rent for his
farm of 10/. per annum, in perpetuity, to com-
mence the third year of his settlement, to be
carried to the emigration fund, and applied in
carrying on the system.
6. That the money annually required to de-
fray the expence of the conveyance and settle-
ment of the emigrants, shall be raised in the
first instance by loan, bearing four per cent,
interest, to be secured by stock created on the
rate, and guaranteed by parliament.
7. That the rate, contribution and rent shall
be applied, first, in payment of the interest of
the loan, then in discharge of the annual ex-
pence of the system; and the surplus as it
arises in liquidation of the loan until paid off*.
8. That a “ Board of Emigration,” be esta-
blished, consisting of members in England,
and members in the colony of New South
Wales, to conduct and manage the whole
system.


The following estimate will shew the opera-
tion of such a system in detail.
Estimate shewing : First, the annual expence
of conveying and settling five thousand pauper
families at New South Wales. Secondly, the
period of time in which the redundant labouring
population (140,481 families) may be withdrawn
from England and established as freeholders
there. And thirdly, the consequent reduction
that would take place in the poors’ rate.
This estimate is made upon the principle that
the amount of contribution from the poors’ rate,
taken at 10/. per annum, per family, for four-
teen years; aided by the rent to be paid by the
emigrants, 10/. per annum, commencing the
third year of his settlement, will fully provide
for the expence of the emigrants’ removal and set-
tlement estimated as before shewn, at 150/. 10s.
And therefore, that in the first year after the emi-
gration of each family, the amount of rate, over
and above the contribution to the emigration
fund, for that family (30/.) will be permanently
reduced, and in the fifteenth year the contribu-
tion will be reduced.
I suppose the whole expence of each annual
set of families or party, to be incurred in the
first instance, and the amount to be raised by


loan ; the contribution, from the rate, and the rents
to be paid over at the qpd of the year to the emi-
gration fund. The interest of the loan to be paid
annually, and the principle to be gradually paid
off as the funds will allow, to commence as soon
as there shall be a surplus of income, after paying
the current annual expences.
The first column shews the annual expenditure; the second column the
annual receipts; the third column the amount borrowed, or loan, each
year; and the fourth column the amount of poor’s rate reduced each
year.

The principle of this plan is obvious; the
establishment of pauper emigrants in New
South Wales, by first applying the disposable
convicts’ labour in that colony, to the prepara-
tion of farms for that purpose; secondly, a
comparatively small contribution from the
poors’ rate, 10/. per annum, for fourteen years,
for every five persons, or 2/. each person
emigrating; and thirdly, a return from the
emigrants themselves, in the shape of a moderate
rent, for the advantages they receive. This
plan does not call for the imposition of any ad-
ditional expence upon any class or fund in the
state. The convict labourers, proposed to be
employed in it, will neither create or require
any additional expence. So far from adding to
the poors’ rate, the great feature of it is the im-
mediate and permanent relief it will afford the
rate. What parish in England would not be
benefitted, by getting rid of all its paupers, and
redundant labourers, at an expence for every
family of five persons, of only 10/. per annum,
for fourteen years ? In what parish, however
favourably circumstanced relative to pauperism
and rate, would not such a plan effect an imme-
diate, permanent and considerable saving in the
rate ? The rents to be paid by the emigrants,
will be moderate in themselves, and such as they
can well afford to pay, yet so considerable in the
aggregate, as after a certain period, to pay the


whole expence of the system, and carry it on
without aid from any other source ; and further-
more yield a revenue more than adequate to the
future expence and maintenance of all the con-
victs, that may be hereafter transported to New
South Wales. Indeed it is capable of demonstra-
tion, that the effect of the plan would be, not
only to remove pauperism and reduce poor’s
rate; but to defray the entire expence of the
criminal police of the empire.
I apprehend there can be little or no difficulty
in carrying such a system of pauper emigration
into effect. With respect to the colony of New
South Wales, it is, I think, perfectly clear, that
there exists no difficulty as to climate, abun-
dance of good land, and more than sufficient
means in the hands of the government, to fit and
prepare it for the reception of poor emigrants.
With respect to England, this system requires
no alteration whatever in any existing law or
institution relative to the poor; it may be car-
ried on to a greater or lesser extent, and will be
beneficial in each. There can be no difficulty in
selecting the emigrants, for I believe there is
not a pauper in England, who would not be
very glad indeed to exchange his condition as
a pauper, for that of a freeholder upon his own
estate in New South Wales; indeed I apprehend
the difficulty would rather be, not in selecting,

but in rejecting the immense numbers that would
offer themselves, inasmuch as the advantages
held out to the emigrant, are far greater than
he can ever expect to enjoy at home. With
respect to the funds to defray the expence, this
system calls for no new tax or burthen of any
kind ; it merely requires that a small portion of
that money, which the overseer has to pay the
pauper for his subsistence at home, shall, and
only for a short period, be paid over to the emi-
gration board, for his, the paupers’ settlement
abroad.
The system will be most beneficial in a variety
of ways. By the employment of the convicts
in New South Wales in this way, it will be
made a school of correction and reform to them,
and more than compensate the state for the ex-
pence of their maintenance ; it will convert
them into profitable labourers. It will create a
truly British colony, rich in climate, soil, and
natural resources, whereby the market for
British industry and manufactures will be con-
siderably enlarged, and her maritime and mer-
cantile power in the Indian and Pacific Oceans
placed on a footing, the advantages of which
are incalculable. The system will give employ-
ment annually and regularly to 50,000 tons of
shipping, and 4,000 seamen, in the mere trans-
port of the emigrants, a matter in itself of no


little importance. The country will not only
be progressively relieved from the burthen of
subsisting a great number of its paupers, but
benefited most materially in having those very
paupers converted into profitable growers of
produce and consumers of manufactures ; from
being burdensome paupers they will become
valuable customers. In a word, this system, if
carried into effect, will in time relieve England
of her paupers, and convert them into produc-
tive and profitable members of the state, reduce
her poors’ rate, raise the wages of labour to its
just and natural standard, and realise all those
other moral and political advantages that must
naturally and necessarily result from the gra-
dual extinction of pauperism and poors’ rate.
It may be objected to this measure, that it
will not succeed in carrying off, or at least in
reducing the redundant labouring population,
for that the reduction effected by emigration
will be immediately or very soon filled up again
by the stimulus thereby given to increase.
There may be something in this objection if it
be true, in fact, that the population is not at
present excessive; if the number of labourers
of every description, be not greater than the
demand for labourers ; if the wages of labour be
sufficient to subsist all that part of the popula-
tion, which depends upon wages for subsis


tence ; then indeed, the vacancy created by the
removal of any part of that non redundant and
well paid population, will very soon be supplied.
But until the supply and demand for labour is
brought to something near this state, I very
much doubt whether this system of gradual
emigration would act as a new and additional
stimulus to the increase of population. It has
been said, provide means of subsistence for the
poor, and you will thereby inevitably increase
population ; you offer a premium for it, as in
the instance of the law of relief; by that law
subsistence is secured to every person, whether
there be employment for him or not, and the
consequence is excessive population, and your
system of emigration will have the same effect.
Now, in the first place, it is not quite so clear
that the increase of population has, in any con-
siderable degree, resulted from the operation of
the poor laws; for, as has been well remarked
in the preliminary observations to the Popula-
tion Abstracts, 1821, “ Although in Scotland
there is no poors’ rate, the ratio of increase (in
the population) since 1811, has been nearly six-
teen per cent., while in England it has been no
more than eighteen per cent., a small difference,
and such as probably would be expected had
poors’ rate equally, or not at all, existed in both
countries and a stronger instance we have in
Ireland, —there no relief of any kind is, by law.


provided for the poor, and yet the population
has increased in a greater ratio than in either
England or Scotland. Experience serves to
prove, therefore, that the poors’ rate has no in-
fluence in excessively promoting population.
And it is, I think, fairly to be concluded, that
emigration, upon the limited extent and gradual
operation here proposed, will not tend to pro-
duce an excessive or additional ratio of increase
in the population.
By emigration only can the labouring popu-
lation be placed in such a condition as to allow
the operation of any of those plans that have
been suggested as preventatives to excessive
population or increasing pauperism and poors’
rate. It has been recommended by the Parlia-
mentary Committee of 1817, page 10 of their
Report, that “ the amount of assessment may
be limited for the time to come.” But how can
this be effected, unless you also limit the num-
ber of paupers or claimants on the rate ? And
how can you limit the number of paupers, unless
by providing for them in some other way ? They
cannot be limited by mere force, much less by
the operation of an act of parliament: however
omnipotent that may otherwise be, 1 fancy it
will neither satisfy hunger, or provide food and
employment where neither existed before. But
when you reduce the number of paupers by


emigration, thus enabling them no longer to be
paupers ; when you find that the demands upon
the rate gradually and regularly diminish, and
that the wages of labour is becoming more and
moie sufficient to subsist the labourer, then
indeed you may limit the amount of assessment
for the time to come, because you have pro-
vided foi the effectual and continual diminution
of the number of claimants upon it.
The same committee recommend that no
ielief should be given in aid of the wages of
laboui, and that no person should be provided
by the parish with work ; but they apprehended
this could not be effected in the then state of
the country. Nor can it be effected in any
state of the country until there shall be full em-
ployment for the entire labouring population,
and the wages of labour becomes sufficient for
the subsistence of the labourer without any
other aid. Such circumstances can be brought
about only by either the decrease of labourers,
or increase of employment; the latter, to any
extent, is not now to be looked for, and the
former can be effected only by emigration ; and
when so effected, then there would, in fact, be
no necessity for parochial relief in aid of wages,
and a law might be safely enacted to prevent it
in future.


The same Committee further suggested,
“ whether, when the demand for labour may
have revived,” relief should be extended only
in proportion and relatively to the number of
children, between certain ages, above the num-
ber which the average rate of wages would
enable a man to maintain ; as, for instance, sup-
posing the average wages of labour to be suf-
ficient to maintain the labourer, his wife and two
children, then relief to be given only where the
number of children is more than two, and of
such an age as not to be able to earn their own
subsistence; the number, above which relief is
to be afforded, to be gradually increased to
three, four, and so on, as the wages of labour
becomes more adequate to subsistence. Now
this measure can be adopted only upon such a
revived demand for labour, as that the wages
will enable the labourer to maintain the number
of children, below which relief is not to be
afforded. The demand for labour has revived,
and is now as great as it will, or can be ex-
pected to be ; but the wages is not sufficient to
enable the labourer to do that which is requisite
for the above purpose ; and it can be raised, in
such a degree as to enable him to do so only by
removing the redundant labourers, whose com-
petition keeps down the rate of wages. The
emigration of the redundant labouring popu-
lation, therefore, and perhaps that only, can


bring about that state of things, in which it will
be possible, or safe, to adopt such a measure.
In short it appears to me, that no plan that
has been hitherto suggested for the diminution
of pauperism, and the reduction of poors’ rate,
whether it be by limiting the amount of assess-
ment ; by compelling men to depend upon their
own resources for subsistence ; by raising the
wages of labour; or by imposing restraints
moral or political on marriage ; can be possibly
carried into effect, or, indeed, at all adopted,
until the wages of labour becomes sufficient
for the subsistence of the labourer; until the
present redundant labouring population be
otherwise provided with employment and sub-
sistence ; until the number of labourers be re-
duced, so as not to be greater than shall be
sufficient to perform the labour to be done;
and this can be effected only by emigration.
Then, indeed, every sound and reasonable re-
medy, both as a present corrective and future
preventive of pauperism and poors’ rate may
be safely resorted to, and adopted with every
hope of success ; and freed from the apprehen-
sion of all those dreadful consequences which,
under the present state of the labouring popu-
lation, any great or sudden change, in the shape
of restraint or reduction of relief would be sure
to produce.


In the foregoing thoughts upon pauper emi-
gration, which I have taken the liberty of re-
spectfully submitting to your consideration, Sir,
as being at the head of the police of the country,
I am sensible there is nothing new ; indeed,
novelty of any kind is what I have endeavoured
to avoid: and the only merit I claim (and that
is purely accidental, arising from a residence of
several years in the colony of New South Wales,
and a not inattentive consideration of its means
and resources) is a knowledge of the great means
possessed by the government, in that colony, of
fitting it for the reception of pauper emigrants
on an extensive scale, and the suggesting this
plan of emigration : which I conceive will have
the effect of very greatly diminishing pauperism
and poors’ rate, without any additional expence
to the public, and without any increased assess-
ment of rate; —and fraught with many other
advantages, —in making New South Wales a
still better and less expensive school of correc-
tion for convicts ; in promoting the welfare and
prosperity of that colony; in very greatly bet-
tering the condition of the poor emigrants wdio
may be settled there ; and in tending to correct
and prevent all those moral and political evils
which the wisest men justly apprehend will,
sooner or later, result from pauperism and
poors’ rate, unless a very considerable change
be effected in both.


Ihe foregoing plan and estimate, it will be
seen, have reference solely to England, where
only the funds from which the expence is pro-
posed to be derived, poors’ rates, exist; but it is
evident the system may be made equally appli-
cable to Ireland, if means could be devised of
raising the necessary expence by some way in
the nature of assessment. County and Baronial
assessments, for erecting bridges, roads, jails,
and other public buildings; and parochial assess-
ments, for erecting and repairing churches, are
familiar to and of long standing in Ireland ; and
there seems to be no difficulty in framing paro-
chial assessments, for the purpose of enabling
the redundant pauper labouring population to
emigrate. There can be no reason to appre-
hend that such an assessment would be liable to
the mischief of the poors’ rate in England : for,
instead of tending to increase an already re-
dundant population and promote idleness, its
object, purpose, and effect, would be to reduce
the population and provide employment for
those who might emigrate, as well as for those
who would remain at home.
It would, perhaps, be desirable, that the an-
nual contribution raised by assessment should
be as low as possible, and therefore necessarily
extended over a greater period of time. Thus,
instead of a contribution of 10/. per annum, per


family, for fourteen years, as proposed for Eng-
land, the contribution may be extended over a
period of twenty, thirty, or forty years ; the
longer the period the less of course, would be
the annual amount. Supposing the contribution
to be extended to forty-two years, it may be
sold, or in other words, converted into a ter-
minable annuity for that period.
It is not necessary, in this place, to go into
the details of a calculation, similar in principle
to that before given : but it is capable of de-
monstration (and the details are ready to be
submitted) that a contribution of two pounds
twelve shillings per annum , for forty-two years ,
for every family of jive persons , in the following
proportions; man 1 6 s., woman 125., children,
three, each Bs.; would be quite adequate with
the rent the emigrant would pay in the colony,
to defray the expence of the conveyance and
settlement of such a family in New South Wales.
Such a sum would, surely, without any great
difficulty be raised by assessment and paid over
to the Emigration Board, by whom, if necessary?
it could be sold in the nature of terminable
annuities for that period. Of course such an
assessment should be established by authority of
parliament, and charged upon the land; nor
could there be much difficulty in regulating


existing interests as to the payment of it. lam
aware there exists, among the Irish gentry, an
universal, and indeed just, disinclination to the
introduction of any thing like poors’ rate into
that country: but, I do think that an assessment
of this nature, and for the purposes here proposed,
would not produce any one of the mischievous
results of the poor laws of England. lam not
aware of any other possible mode by which the
expence of pauper emigration, to anything like
an useful extent, can be provided for. And if
the Irish land proprietors, from any ill-grounded
fears of the mischief of poors’ rate, will not
agree to the adoption of some such means
for promoting the emigration of the redundant
population of Ireland, but will be looking to the
imperial government, or in other words to taxes
to be levied on the people of England (who
have, certainly, no right to pay for the emigra-
tion, or otherwise support the redundant popu-
lation of Ireland; to keep up the excessive
rents and encrease the incomes of the Irish
gentry) they will give just reasons for suspecting
that they are influenced rather by motives of
private and individual, though mistaken inte-
rest, than by patriotism and humanity: and their
encreasing distresses will meet with little com-
miseration, as they may be fairly attributed to
themselves. If every poor family of five per


sons can be comfortably settled in New South
Wales, at the very trifling expence to the country
of two pounds twelve shillings per annum , for
forty-two years, I think the mouths of the Irish
gentry, as to all claims of relief from the impe-
rial parliament, must be stopped; and if they
will not consent to incur so trifling an expence
for such a purpose, perhaps it will be said, they
deserve to suffer all the mischiefs of a redundant,
unemployed, starving population.
I have proposed, that five thousand families
should annually emigrate from England, a like
number of families from Ireland could be also
as well provided for in New South Wales; for
the number of crown labourers, in that colony,
now at the disposal of the government is quite
sufficient to prepare ten thousand farms every
year for the reception of poor emigrants. If a
greater number than ten thousand families in
the whole, were to be sent out annually, then it
would become necessary to employ ail above
that number, the first year of their settlement,
in erecting houses and preparing farms for them-
selves ; creating a further expence of a year’s
provisions and clothing. The emigrant put in
possession of a house and farm, ready prepared,
will require only one year’s subsistence; whereas
the emigrant having to erect the house and pre-
pare the farm, one complete year’s labour, will


require two years’ subsistence before he can
maintain himself by the produce.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient humble Servant.
POSTSCRIPT.
Subsequently to preparing these papers for
the press, I had occasion to refer to the Parlia-
mentary Report, (July, 1823,) on the employ-
ment of the poor in Ireland, where I was
gratified to find that a plan of pauper emi-
gration to Canada, similar in principle to mine,
had been submitted to the government of this
country, by Colonel Talbot, of the Talbot
settlement in that province. Although the
principle of Colonel Talbot's plan, as far as the
application of a certain part of the poors’ rate
to the expence of the emigration and settle-
ment of the pauper in one of our colonies, is
similar to mine j yet they differ very materially
in the detail.
It appears by the estimates submitted to the
above committee, that the expence of conveying
the emigrants to their destination in upper
Canada, and supplying them with provision for


one year there, would be for each man 351.,
every woman 25/., and every child under four-
teen years of age 14/.; or for man, wife, and
three children 102/. In this estimate clothing,
bedding, and ship furniture, for the passage out,
clothing during the first year at the settlement,
furniture and agricultural implements are not
included, neither is the expence of erecting a
dwelling house, clearing any part of the land, or
erecting a barn, at all taken into the account;
all which are absolutely necessary for pauper
emigrants , and allowed for in my plan. I have
had some experience as to the period of time,
in which a poor man, by his own labour, can
erect a hut and bring such a portion of forest
land into a state of culture and tillage as will be
sufficient to maintain his family in New South
Wales ; a country far more favourably circum-
stanced,, as to the labour and expence of clear-
ing land, than Upper Canada : and I have no
hesitation in saying, that the erection of a log-
hut, and clearing and cultivating sufficient land,
to subsist a family by the produce, cannot be
done, by one pair of hands, in less than two
years. Now, from the statement made to the
committee, it appears that the cost of clearing
land in Upper Canada is at least 4/. 105. "per
acre, and that the labour of oxen is absolutely
necessary in the process of burning off the
timber, which it seems is very heavy and abun-
K


dant on the land. I have consulted other
authorities, Howison, Gourlay, and Strahan’s
books, and I find that the expence of erecting a
log-hut is from 12 1, to SOL ; that grain is never
stacked in the open air, but always put in a
barn, and the general cost of erecting a barn is
from 30/. to 60/.; that the cost of clearing land
is from 41. 10s. to 6/. per acre; that the ground
is covered with snow from December to March ;
and cattle must be fed in house, or yard, from
November to April. Now, I say, that under
such circumstances, where the labour of clear-
ing land is so great, and in fact, absolutely re-
quiring the assistance of oxen; the labour of
erecting a house and barn, both of which are
absolutely necessary, so very considerable; and
the utter impossibility of procuring labour un-
less at an enormously high price; it is impos-
sible for a pauper emigrant , with no other
means than his own pair of hands, to erect a
house and barn, and clear and crop a sufficient
quantity of land in one year , to maintain him-
self and his family from. I say, that during the
single year he is to be supplied with provisions,
he will not be able, on such a farm, with all his
industry, to do more than erect his hut and
clear without cropping a small portion of his land.
That it will occupy the whole of the second
year to clear and crop a sufficient quantity of land
to grow produce to subsist on ; and that it will


be the third year before the produce can be ap-
plied to the actual maintenance of his family ;
until which time he must receive rations or
starve. And I further say that he cannot stop
on the farm at all, unless a house is previously
erected for his reception ; and that it would be
worse than folly to place a pauper upon such a
farm, in such a climate, without a house to put
his head in, or a particle of land cleared fit to
cultivate. I know well that poor emigrants
cannot possibly succeed, with only one year’s
supply of provisions, in any uncultivated coun-
try, unless they obtain farms whereon houses
are erected, and so much land ready cleared
to cultivate as that they may commence crop-
ping, at the outset, a sufficient quantity to
afford them subsistence the next year. In New
South Wales, where labour is more abundant
and far cheaper than in Canada; where th e
labourer can work all the year, winter as well
as summer; and where the character of the
country is open forest, what in Canada is called
“ plain land and where the entire expence of
clearing land is only 28 s. per acre ; it requires,
at least, two years before the settler can derive
subsistence from his farm. And sure I am,
from a consideration of the statement submitted
to the committee, and the report of all who
have written on Canada, that subsistence cannot
be obtained from the land in a less period in


that province, even by settlers possessed of
some capital, much less by pauper settlers pos-
sessed of no capital. And I do, therefore, con-
clude that, taking the estimates submitted to
the committee to be correct as far as they go,
there should be added the expence of clothing,
bedding, and ship furniture for the passage :
furniture, and agricultural implements, for the
house and farm ; clothing for the settler, for at
least two years after his arrival at the farm ;
provisions for another year, and the expence of
erecting a log house; which several items will
be as follows :
Expence of the passage, and con-
veyance to the farm in Canada,
of a man, wife, and three chil-
dren, according to Colonel Tal-
bot’s estimate . - - £’lo2 0 0
Provisions for the second year,
same as first, in the same estimate 32 10 0
Bedding, clothing, &c. for the pas-
sage same as my estimates - 9 18 0
Household furniture, and agricul-
tural implements, same as my
estimates - - . . 8 15 0
Clothing, two years, same as my
estimate - - - - 17 0 0
Cost of erecting a log house, 1812 18 0 0
£IBB 3 0


to defray which a terminable annuity for °25
years, of 12/. 3s. b\d. would be necessary in-
stead of 6/. 10s. 9 d. as stated in the estimates
submitted to the committee.
In making a comparison between Upper
Canada and New South Wales, as to fitness for
the reception and settlement of pauper emi-
grants, the advantages seem to be clearly on
the side of New South Wales. As to climate,
New South Wales is certainly superior, because
it is not only milder and more healthy, although
Upper Canada seems to be sufficiently healthy,
but the labourer is not impeded any part of the
year through in his labour ; he is not prevented
by the severity of winter from carrying on his
agricultural pursuits. As to soil, it seems to be
excellent in Canada, but it is equally good in New
South Wales ; and indeed the average produce
in both countries is nearly the same, with the
exception of maize, which is far greater in New
South Wales. But New South Wales has an in-
calculable advantage, and one which outweighs
all others, in the excellent and unlimited extent
of its natural pastures ; no other fodder, winter
or summer, is requisite for horned cattle, horses
and sheep ; there exists no necessity either for
growing grasses or providing winter food for
any description of cattle, except working cattle.
Neither is the land so heavily timbered as in


Canada, and it is consequently cleared and
brought into cultivation, with much less labour
and expence, being as before stated for falling
or chopping, and clearing, 28s. per acre. The
produce of both colonies is nearly of the same
kind, with the exception of fine Merino wool?
which is becoming and will be the great staple
of New South Wales, a staple, equally valuable
for the colony and the mother country ; and
such as Canada from the nature of its climate
and pastures cannot possess. And above all,
with regard to the public means at the command
of the government, I mean the convicts’
labour ; for the preparation of farms for poor
emigrants, nothing of the kind exists in Canada.
And further, in reference to expence it has been
seen, that although Canada is so much nearer
than New South Wales, yet, owing to the great
extent of land carriage, the scarcity of labour,
the difficulty of erecting houses, and of clearing
land, and the severity of the climate, it will cost
one-fourth more to settle a family in Canada
than in New South Wales ; and that when set-
tled in the latter colony, the emigrant can make
a direct return or compensation in the shape of
rent; whereas it does not appear that when set-
tled in the former, he can make any direct re_
turn whatever.


With respect to the funds required for carrying
on the one system and the other there is a most
material difference. It appears that the entire
expence of settling the pauper family in Canada,
188/. must come from the poor’s rate, or some
similar fund, and if raised by way of terminable
annuity for twenty-five years, would require
12/. 3s. s |d. per annum for that period, and if
by contribution, for fourteen years, would re-
quire 20/. a year for that term. On the other
hand, a part only of the expence of settling the
pauper in New South Wales, is required for the
poor’s rate, namely, a contribution of 10/. for
fourteen years, or an equivalent terminable an-
nuity for twenty-five years, 61. Bs. 6d., so that
the expence of the one system, would cost the
public nearly double that of the other; and,
from the different circumstances of the two
colonies, would, I am sure, cost more than
double ; for in the one, New South Wales, the
expence of carrying out is scarcely greater than
to the other, while the expence of preparing the
farms is very considerably less, and the emigrant
himself will be enabled to contribute largely to
the expence of his settlement.
On the whole then it appears to me, beyond
question, that New South Wales is of all our
colonies that in which pauper emigrants can be
settled with the least expence to the public;


with the greatest advantage to the paupers them-
selves, and with the greatest benefit to other
great public interests; and that its superiority
over Canada, for this purpose, consists in the
mass of disposable convicts’ labour at command
there; the greater facility and the less labour and
expence of clearing and cultivating land ; the
superior mildness of its climate; and the un-
limited extent and superiority of its natural
pastures.
