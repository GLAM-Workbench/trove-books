The scenic beauties of New South Wales are ex-
tensive and diverse. The climate of the State
ranges from the arctic snows of Kosciusko to the
sub-tropical glow of the rich region nestling under
the shadow of the picturesque mountain range
which marks at one point the northern boundary.
Its eastern shore is washed by the crested rollers
of the wide Pacific, and its territory runs by hill
and tableland and valley through several meridians
of longitude to the rich dry plains stretching end-
less beneath the rim of the setting sun. Though,
therefore, there is a wide range of difference in
temperature, the normal weather throughout the
State is bright sunshine with clear blue skies.
There is no bad weather season. Most of the
tourist resorts are easily reached from the City
by rail, tram, or ferry, but where this is not the
case they are reached by good roads leading,
as a rule, through pleasing scenery.
The leading tourist resorts of the State may be
classified as follows :
Sydney and its Surroundings.
The Illawarra and South Coast Districts.
The Blue Mountains.
Jenolan and other Caves
The Hawkesbury District.
The Northern Lakes and Rivers.
The New England District.
The North Coast District.
The Southern Highlands.
Kosciusko, on the Australian Alps.
At the end of each chapter the principal tourist
places in the district are mentioned, their distance
from the Capital, how they may be reached, and
the cost of transit. As fares and time-tables are
subject to frequent revision, reference should be

made to the Government Tourist Bureau for infor-
mation as to their correctness at time of inquiry.
The charges for accommodation vary from
6s. to 12s. 6d. per day at Hotels, £i is. to £2 2s.
per week at Boarding Houses, and from £1 to
£1 1 os. per week at Farm Houses.
The New South Wales Government Tourist
Bureau, Challis House, Sydney, will upon personal
or written application, readily furnish detailed
information as to routes, the cost of railway,
motor, or coach service and accommodation.
Brochures and maps, giving more particular intelli-
gence of most of the State’s Tourist Districts,
may also be had gratis from the Government
Tourist Bureau.

Holiday Ground for the Tourist
Sydney and its
S urro mi diiigs .
Few cities have a more beautiful situation than
Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, standing
on the shores of the peerless Harbour of Port
Jackson. This Harbour, which has a frontage of
200 miles, its clear blue waters deep to the rocky
shores, contains numberless picturesque bays and
inlets, winding and penetrating in all directions
among the sandstone hills. Long stretches of the
foreshores along the Parramatta and Lane Cove
Rivers, particularly about the upper portion of
the harbour, are thickly covered with virgin
bush, but about the harbour centre, on either side,
long lines of well-made streets faced by huge
buildings, and busy with traffic, give at once a
striking impression of the large, important, bust-
ling modern city which lies behind. Sydney is
the commercial Capital of Australia, and the port
of the British Empire next in importance by
virtue of the extent of its trade, to London,
Liverpool, Cardiff, and Newcastle-on-Tyne.
But the commercial importance of Sydney, and
its marvellous growth as a trade centre are matters
outside the scope of this booklet. Information on
that subject will readily be found in proper
books of reference.
The exquisite situation of Sydney, and the beauty
of its surroundings have won universal acknow-
ledgment. Its waterside suburbs afford splendid
residential sites, and the panoramic views of city,
ocean, harbour, and the wooded slopes broken by
intruding harbour inlets, obtainable from the
beautiful homes of the fortunate residents of


/ -N
SAILING BOATS, SYDNEY HARBOUR
Sydney’s aquatic suburbs, have no superior in any
city on earth. These suburbs, and indeed the
whole of the Capital’s environing districts, are
connected by tramway and ferry systems, as
extensive, cheap, and effective as those of the
greatest of the world’s cities. In fact, travellers
by general consent place the tramway systems of
Sydney and Glasgow as the best in the world.
From Circular Quay a ferry-boat or tram may
be taken to any of these suburbs. From any
point on the coastline may be obtained the most
glorious panoramic views of the bold coastal pro-
montories, the connecting chain of beaches, and
of the broad expanse of the Pacific.
Sydney’s climate is unrivalled. The difference
between the average summer and winter read-
ings of the thermometer is but 17 degrees
probably the most equable known. Throughout
all seasons of the year, the normal conditions are
bright sunshine and cloudless skies, making out-
door life genial and enjoyable. The experience of
oppressive warmth or biting cold, hurricanes or
blizzards, is one which Sydney residents are
strangers to in their own city.
Sydney is well supplied with parks and gardens.
Chief of these are the Botanic Gardens, lying

between the Domain and the Harbour waters at
Farm Cove. The Domain, an extensive Park, in
which the National Art Gallery is situated, fronts
the foreshores of Farm Coves and Woolloomooloo
Bay. Hyde Park lies in the heart of the city
between St. James’ Road and Liverpool-street. A
little further away, and reached by the eastern
suburbs tramway system is Centennial Park, which
is the city’s largest playground. It contains 552
acres, and is circled by a splendid driving or motor-
ing road.
In summer the weather conditions are ideal for
every form of aquatic sport. In this season the
waters of Port J ackson are studded with the white
wings of innumerable sailing craft of every size
and build; and then, too, on the ocean beaches,
at Narrabeen, Manly, Bondi, Coogee, Maroubra,
and along the coast to Cronulla, Port Hacking,
and beyond, the surf-bather seeks the golden
sands and curling breakers, in which he disports
at pleasure.
The harbour resorts and ocean beaches may be
reached within thirty minutes from the City by
electric car or ferry steamer. Sydney presents so

many pleasure resorts to the attention of the
visitor, so many short entrancing trips among
delightful bays and headlands, that it might have
been designed by nature as a place to revel and
make merry in when done with work.
Sydney Harbour is a world of magnificent pic-
nicking grounds. It is late in the day to attempt
a description of Port Jackson —which magnificent
basin has won eulogies alike from the aesthetic
dreamer and the practical man of business—the
lake-like expanse of water which stretches inland
from the haughty precipitous fronts of the harbour
heads, a distance of some dozen or fifteen miles,
presenting a galaxy of enchanting scenes. The
fame of this glorious sheet of water is world-wide,
and it holds the visitor to Sydney with an interest
deep and lasting.
It shines amongst fair flowering hills, and flows
By dells of glimmering greenness manifold,
And all day long, when soft-eyed spring comes round
With gracious gifts of bird, and leaf, and grass,
And through the noon, when sumptuous summer sleeps
By yellowing runnels under beetling cliffs,
This royal water blossoms far and wide
With ships from all the corners of the world.
It would occupy days by the ordinary means of
transit to see even a few of the most beautiful
and popular of the harbour resorts, and the
Government Tourist Bureau have arranged for a

weekly all-day trip round the harbour, in a special
observation steamer. Visitors may see more on
this single trip than they could in a week in the
ordinary way.
The harbour by moonlight on a summer evening
is a paradise. The rendezvous of the ferry steamers
at Circular Quay is then a striking spectacle. The
city gleams with long strings of jewel lights, and
the brilliant electric arcs which outline the maze
of the Quay make dim the stars. Thousands of
dazzling lights on shore and on ferry steamers hurry-
ing to and fro, are multiplied millionfold by the
broken reflections of the waters whose surface is
stirred by the quickly-moving boats. In passing
the Quay-way the moon’s pale beams reveal the
shadowy silhouettes of ocean giants lying silently
at anchor, surrounded by a flood of long, still,
glowing reflections of their own illuminations;
while beyond, the faint dark outline of the neigh-
bouring hills furnishes an appropriate background
to the weird and fascinating sight.
To the lover of every form of aquatic pastime
Sydney’s magnificent harbour offers the most
varied attractions. Sailing men can take their

craft to do battle with the swell of the Pacific
as it rolls in at the Heads, or glide over the stiller
waters of the lower Parramatta; oarsmen have a
similar choice, and light boats may explore the
exquisite nooks of bush and fern in the upper
reaches of Middle Harbour, the Parramatta, and
the Lane Cove. For lovers of the “ gentle art ”
there is abundant sport with rod and line; and
the fascination of snapper fishing may be enjoyed
from the steamers that take its votaries to the
various grounds off the Heads. For swimmers
there are large and commodious baths where
quiet-water swimming and diving can be indulged
in to one’s heart’s content, in perfect safety; and
for surf-bathers white beaches and thundering
rollers lie within easy access of Sydney. And the
glorious views from the heights around the harbour
as the sunlight streams upon the hilly shore-line,
the sparkling waters, and white-winged yachts;
or, as the moon turns the mighty water-way into
a river of molten silver set in ebony, with the
jewel lights of the city shooting broken luminous
ribbons across the waters, all combine to make
Sydney’s beautiful port peerless amongst the
harbours of the world.

The Illawarra and
South Coast Districts\
The South Coast railway line, lying between
Sydney and Nowra, affords the tourist and health-
seeker one of the most picturesque and interesting
tours in the State.
Soon after leaving Sydney the railway passes
through the rapidly-growing Illawarra suburbs,
from which branches extend to the beautiful
watering-places at Sans Souci, Sandi'ingham, on
the northern shore of George’s River, near its
entrance to Botany Bay, and Brighton-le-Sands,
on the shores of Botany Bay, right opposite the
heads. Kurnell the landing-place of Captain
Cook, is situated just inside the southern head-
land of Botany Bay —Cape Solander, opposite
Lady Robinson’s Beach at Brighton-le-Sands, and
there is no place in the Continent of such historical
interest to Australians, for it was here that the
Australian nation was cradled about 120 years ago.
The trustees have recently improved the reserve at
Kurnell,. which now offers ample facilities for
visitors and holiday makers. It is reached by
steamer regularly each week-end and holiday in
summer; special arrangements being made for
large parties on week-days. At Como, a tourist
resort fast growing in popular favour, the
magnificent estuary of George’s River is crossed,
and thence the line proceeds by rocky cuttings
which command excellent views of George’s River,
to National Park.
National Park—the people’s heritage covers
an area of 36,300 acres. The rocky coast-
line forms its eastern boundary for miles, it
faces the picturesque gorge of the Woronora
River for miles, and the many tinted shallows
of Port Hacking for miles, and has a frontage
of 9 miles to the Illawarra railway line. The
Port Hacking River, which intersects the Park, is

reached after a pleasant walk or wagonette drive,
zigzagging down hill all the way, each turn in the
road revealing charming glimpses of the river.
At Audley, in the Park, about three-quarters of
a mile from the railway platform, a stone weir
divides the salt waters from the fresh, and at this
point light rowing skiffs may be hired. The native
beauty of the scenery all through the Park has
been preserved, and is being jealously guarded by
the trustees, who have made the various parts
accessible by means of unobtrusive roads and
footpaths. A pull on the Freshwater is delightful.
It threads its way through sylvan scenes of
great beauty. The glass-like surface of the stream
perfectly reflects the hillsides and their prolific
covering of vegetation, which, in many places,
meets overhead in graceful arches. So clear-cut
are the reflections here, that from photographs
taken of some of the spots it would be difficult to
tell which way the lens received the image.
Warumbul, another favourite spot, is a few miles
down the stream from Audley. At both these
places there is good accommodation for visitors.
In the spring, when the new leaves unfurl in
delicate flushing tenderness, and the ferns uplift
their tiny red croziers, “ and all the bush puts on

a ruddy hue,” the whole district is a mass of
flowers. The native rose and many varieties of
boronia and heath bloom freely here, intermingling
with everlasting flowers, bright yellow pea-shaped
blossoms, soft, golden wattle, and the brilliant
crimson bunches of the giant lily, which rears its
head on a stem sometimes 20 feet in height. From
the trees, the starry clematis with other climbers
hang in festoons, and in the gullies the brilliant
sunlight breaks through the vivid green of tree-
ferns and myrtle, streaking the waters with golden
lines.
The National Park is a glorious territory, with
varied and exquisite scenery and surpassing native
charms, and its wealth of delightful nooks and
bowers, together with its accessibility, will make it
Australia’s grandest and most popular picnic ground.
There is much for the tourist to do along the salt-
water river; good fishing may be had as well as the
pleasures of boating, swimming, and shooting, in
the season. Pleasant walks through the unmarked
bush may be taken, and new country may be

explored on each occasion. There is a regular
launch service from Audley to all parts of Port
Hacking.
Cronulla Beach, one of the best and safest for
surf-bathing, is reached by coach from Sutherland
by a road which leads also to Yowie and Gunna-
matta Bays, two of the many beautiful inlets of
Port Hacking.
A few miles beyond
traversing the darkness
there suddenly bursts
wonderful panorama of
Sutherland, and after
of the Otford Tunnel,
upon the traveller a
ocean, mountain, and
forest the gateway to the Garden of the
South. The blue waters of the Pacific roar
at one’s feet on the left, and to the right towers
the mountain range, which forms the western
wall of this veritable garden close. First comes
the sheltered seaside resort of Stanwell Park,
with its towering palms, white beaches, lagoons,
and a wealth of beautiful views. There is good
accommodation here, and no better spot could be
chosen for a restful holiday.


* f
AT STANWELL PARK.
Immediately after passing Stanwell Park, the
railway line skirts the coast almost the whole of
the way to Nowra, lying in many places close to
the margin of the sea, and the journey, ever full
of pleasure and interest, is comparable only
to that along the Mediterranean littoral through
France and Italy. Away to the south, headland
after headland stretch into the Pacific, until the
furthest is lost in the haze; for on a summer’s day
the light purple mists soften the distant outlines,
till even the ocean and sky become indistinguish-
able and the horizon is lost in a sea which stretches
away into the very region of dreams.
Thirroul, a growing health resort, lies on the sea
at the foot of the mountain range Two miles
further on is the township from which the Bulli
Pass derives its now historic name. It is charm-
ingly situated close by the sea, which tumbles in
on a chain of beautiful semi-circular sandy beaches.
The rich red volcanic soil of the surrounding
country yields a bewildering wealth of sub-tropical
vegetation. The Pass, about 3 miles from town,
affords a delightful drive or walk, and those who
have not seen it have indeed missed a sight as
fine as anything of its kind to be found anywhere.
David Christie Murray says of it:—“To begin
with, picture for yourself a rough little paling at
the precipitous edge of the road; lean over it, if
you have the nerve, and if you choose you may
drop a pebble, which will fall more than 200 feet
without touching clay or foliage. The precipice

overhangs, and that mere reflection seems to make
the ground unstable. Below, to the front and left
and right, lies the sea, a scene of most delicate
azure, fading on the horizon into palest turquoise.
The sands are golden, and curved into innumerable
bays. A line of white foam following the delicate
outline of the shore breaks utterly unheard away
and away; and away to the right waves this most
undulating triple line of blue and white and gold,
gradually converging in the distance, and stretch-
ing beyond the power of vision. The land sweeps
boldly up in striking lines, and every hillside is a
very riot of verdure. The gum asserts itself
here and there, but mixes its grim grey with
many more cheerfully-coloured growths, and in
the mid-distance a slender column of blue smoke
marks the whereabouts of some unseen factory or
mine. On the extreme verge of the distance the
white houses of the town of Shellharbour gleam
softly with a brightness chastened by the inter-
vening air. An unbroken stillness broods over it
all, and though the atmosphere is as clear as
crystal, as the vividness with which all objects at
a moderate distance are seen declares, a tender
blue gauze seems everywhere drawn across the
distance. It seems half to shroud the brightness
of the sunlit sky, and thickens softly towards
the horizon, so that the sea and sky seem to
mingle one with the other. This one picture was
enough to repay the most exigent of sight-seers
for a journey three times the length that we

had taken.” It is not mere extravagance of ver-
biage to say that the panorama which unfolds itself
before the onlooker at the summit of Bulli Pass
is unsurpa sed in the world.
Wollongong, the principal centre of population
in the Illawarra, is beautifully situated, and is
surrounded by a wealth of splendid views. Land-
wards the imposing crowns of Mounts Keira and
Kembla tower many hundred feet skywards; their
brows are scarred with passes which carry one
into all sorts of delightful nooks and corners.
Within a few minutes the visitor may reach Stuart
Park, Brighton Beach, the Three-Mile Beach, the
Swimming Baths, Tom Thumb Lagoon, the Race-
course, Show Ground, the Golf Links and Cycling
Grounds. The town is well supplied with hotels
of considerable size, and all other features essentia]
to a well-equipped watering-place.


KEMBLA PASS, ILLAWARRA.
Shellharbour, a quiet holiday resort, is another
ocean village with a beautiful shell-strewn beach
and many neighbouring picnic places.
Kiama is pleasantly situated in close proxi-
mity to the well-known Jamberoo Valley, a large
portion of which was once a desolate swamp.
Close handy are the Minnamurra Falls and the
mountain which, from its physical configuration,
has been called “ Saddleback.” The local
attraction above all others is the well-known
“ Blow Hole,” a natural freak, and a never-ending
source of interest to visitors. The onrushing sea,
in heavy weather, drives with terrific force and a
booming roar through a natural opening in the
cliffs, shooting up huge geysers of spray with
each dash of the waves. The locality is also
famous for its peculiar basaltic rock formations—
notably, the Cathedral Rock.


the: shoalhaven river, near nowra
Nowra is at present the terminus of the South
Coast line. The town lies on the southern side
of the Shoalhaven River, 92 miles from Sydney.
The railway terminus is on the opposite side of
the river at Bomaderry. The road crosses the river
on a splendid bridge. The Shoalhaven is the most
majestic stream in the southern half of the State,
and offers great attractions tor the tourist. It is
prolific in fish, and is supplied with ample boating
facilities. Greenwell Point, a delightful place, is
at the mouth 10 miles away, and Jervis Bay, one
of the largest in the Pacific coast is 14 miles distant.
St, George’s Basin —a large salt-water lake connected
with the ocean at Wreck Bay by a narrow inlet, lies
17 miles by road from Nowra. There is usually
good fishing on the lake, and one may obtain
adequate accommodation on the banks, quite
handy to the fishing grounds.
Between Nowra and Eden, which lies on the
shores of Twofold Bay near the southern extremity
of the coastline, are some important settlements,
the centres of prosperous dairying districts, often
visited by tourists who desire a quiet holi-
day. Notable amongst these are Milton, Ulla-
dulla, Nelligen, Cobargo, Bermagui, Bega, Candelo,
Pambula, Wolumla and Eden. Most of these

places are situated on or near the coast and have
all the alluring attractions of maritime resorts.
The scenery of the rivers and mountain spurs
which lie close to most of them is picturesque,
and for sport they offer boating, swimming,
fishing, and shooting. Eden has won considerable
fame as a whaling station. A regular motor-car
service has been established between Cooma and
Bega, which fills a want felt by many who dislike
the ocean journey. The distance from Cooma to
Bega is 74 miles, the seaport being Tathra, 11 miles
distant. Eden lies 36 miles further south. First
class rail tickets between Sydney and Cooma are
available for return in the saloon by any of these
steamers without extra charge; but tourists taking
this round trip in the reverse direction are obliged
to pay a slight excess for the rail ticket from Cooma.
Its interesting Geology.
Geologically the journey is most interesting.
Before Clifton is reached the three formations
which are grouped under the “ Trias,” are crossed.
Sydney lies nearly in the middle of these trias,
which are arranged somewhat in the shape,, of
saucers. The uppermost consists of a layer,"of

shales, which are thickest’near Wianamatta Creek,
near Rooty Hill. Hence it is called the Wiana-
matta shale. Below is the huge saucer more than
1,000 feet thick, consisting of various sandstones,
known as the Hawkesbury Sandstones. Below
these occur the chocolate shales of the Narrabeen
series, which appear near Bulli. The lower tiers
in the pile of saucers consist of various beds in-
terspersed with coal seams, the whole constituting
the Coal Measures of the Great Basin, or as it is
more scientifically termed, the geo-syncline. Prac-
tically the whole way from Sydney to Otford
(30 miles), the train passes through Hawkesbury
sandstone. At St. Peters (3 miles) the bluish tinge
of the Wianamatta shales are seen. At any part
of the journey the line passes over coal seams.
At Sydney the coal “ saucer ” would be tapped
about 3,000 feet down. At Helensburgh it is only
800 feet below the surface, while at Coal Cliff,
Clifton, Bulli, and other places it outcrops at the
side of the hill. Round about Helensburgh the
traveller sees the outcrop of Narrabeen shales,
which are redder than the Wianamatta shales seen
at St. Peters. The country near Bulli has been
subjected to great volcanic outbursts in past ages.
At Helensburgh large areas of coal have been
burnt by the intrusion of molten rocks, and the
coke thus formed has actually been sold profitably.
On emerging from the tunnel at Otford the
sandstones are left behind, and the traveller is
struck with the difference in vegetation. Instead
of stunted ferns and heath with a poor sandy soil,
there is now a stretch of clayey soil much more
fertile, as evidenced by the luxuriant grass and
prodigal growth of shrubs and ferns and cabbage-
tree palms.
This difference is primarily due to the fact that
the outcrop of Narrabeen shales has been reached.

THE SOUTH COAST
TOURIST DISTRICT


The Blue Mountains.
Close to the Metropolis, and reached by a
first-class service of speedy trains, are the ranges
of the Blue Mountains, which form the mighty
eastern wall upholding the central tablelands of
the New South Wales plateau system. These
mountains are famed far and wide for their scenes
of rugged majesty, and for the peculiarly exhil-
arating and health-giving qualities of the air of
their upland forests. It is these attractions which
have made the many excellently equipped tourist
resorts in the Blue Mountain districts such univer-
sal favourites, not only in New South Wales but
also in the other States, and with visitors from
other lands. In summer, when the moist warmth
of the coastal regions or the drier heat of the
central plains make a change to a cooler climate
the most welcome method of spending the holiday
seasons, the mountains afford an ideal resort for
the achieving of this end; there is no over-violent
contrast of temperature to be feared—none of the
danger that might be incurred by rushing from
warm summer weather into regions of snow and
glacier, but the air is delightfully cool and bracing,
and the scenery is far-famed for its majesty and
grandeur. In winter the really bitter days are few
and far between, and this season of the year is
becoming increasingly a favourite with those who
prefer to make their sojourn in the heights before
the regular tourist season has opened. The
scenery is magnificent, and is yet strangely dif-
ferent from that made up of snowy peaks, and
glacier torrents which one is so apt to associate
with the name of mountain. In the Blue Mountains
the most characteristic features are mighty abysses
worn by the rushing torrents of bygone days,
and the spectator, gazing from the vantage-ground
of some beetling crag, views wonderful panoramas
of giant precipice and intervening tree-carpeted
valleys at giddy depths, with a delicate veil of

blue mist softening the outlines on the distant
horizon; or the many waterfalls, of marvellous
beauty, that plunge in silvery torrents of spray
over mighty cliffs, or rush in graceful cascades
through fairy bowers and nooks of mountain
fern.
From Glenbrook, the first of the mountain
stations up to Lawson, there are many enchanting
scenes and beautiful resorts, which have their
own peculiar attractions. There are some exquisite
country villas on this stretch, and good boarding-
house accommodation for those wishing to recreate
themselves in the balmy air and restful quiet of
the lower mountains. The great waterfall country
and impressive canyon scenery begins at Went-
worth Falls, for here the valleys are deeper and

broader, and the precipices more abrupt. Perhaps
the most grand and awe-inspiring scenery is to be
found in the valleys, in whose depths the tall trees
massed together look from above like a soft carpet
of sombre verdure, fading away towards the
horizon in blue and tender mauve. The shadows
of the clouds creep in masses of indigo across the
great gulfs, and the sun lights up the bright
cliffs, which are streaked with red and yellow from
stains of iron. Little niches in the walls are green
with shrubs and ferns, and on the wider ledges
are clumps of trees. From the hilltops the cas-
cades leap the awful abyss, and sink on the rocks
beneath in a veil of spray. Wentworth Falls
plunge in three cascades of fully 1,000 feet to the
basin at the head of a magnificent gorge.
Of the Blue Mountains, Darwin says:—“ It is
not easy to conceive a more magnificent spectacle
than is presented to a person walking on the
summit plains, when, without any notice, he
arrives at the brink of one of these cliffs, which
are so perpendicular that he can strike with a
stone the trees growing at a depth of between
1,000 and 1,500 feet below him. On both sides
he sees headland beyond headland of the receding

line of cliffs, and on the opposite side of the valley
—often a distance of several miles —he beholds
another line rising up to the same height on which
he stands.”
A characteristic blue haze overhangs the whole
vision, and the vastness of the precipitous gorges,
and the immense extent of the silent, rugged
mountain scenery, all so wild and impressive,
cannot fail to inspire a feeling almost akin to
awe, only to be replaced by one of soothing calm
and restful peace, when the closer view unfolds
the gorges clad in ferns of delicate loveliness, and
cascades and waterfalls of rare beauty and grace.
At Wentworth Falls the distinctive feature is the
National Pass, though there is here a magnificent
series of waterfalls, cascades, and delightful picnic
nooks, which occur with confusing frequency.
The National Pass is a narrow track about 2 miles
long, connecting the main falls with the Valley
of the Waters, and circling the base of one of the
boldest promontories overlooking the great Jameson


RISING MISTS IN A BLUE MOUNTAIN VALLEY.
Valley. The descent to the pass is by way of a
rocky stairs cut in the bald face of the cliffs at
Pitt’s Amphitheatre, and the upper part of the
passage to the bottom overhangs the valley a
thousand feet below. From the foot of the Falls
the Pass follows the contour of the cliffs about mid-
way down, so that there is always straight overhead
several hundred feet of the great towering cliffs,
and the talus, wooded and vine-tangled, sloping
to the valley bottom about the same distance
below. All along the Pass are luxurious fern
growths and babbling streamlets, and every now
and again a turn in the path reveals the magnificent
panorama of the Jameson Valley.


ii
BRIDAL VEIL FALL, LEURA.
The Valley of the Waters, at Wentworth Falls, is
one of the gems of the district. In a secluded
fern-embowered glen, many tiny streamlets come
tumbling among the moss-grown rocks, splashing
and leaping from ledge to ledge, and finally losing
themselves by a precipitous drop to the valley
bottom.
Leura is famed chiefly for its cascades and rustic
walks among groves of tree ferns. Paths lead
from the town to beautiful sights in all directions,
but the best known and most popular proceeds by
thousands of steps to the valley bottom, under-
neath the enchanting waterfall known as the
Bridal Veil. Near this point the Federal Pass,
a similar defile to the National Pass at Wentworth
Falls, commences. It connects the Leura Falls
with Katoomba, passing many beautiful spots in
its length of some three miles, terminating at the
bottom of the Katoomba Falls.

Katoomba is a district rich in waterfalls, rustic

renowned sights as the Three Sisters, Echo Point,
the Orphan Rock, and Katoomba Falls. It is
the largest of the mountain towns.

and from whose garage motors may be hired for all
the mountain sights and also the Jenolan Caves.
The show place of Blackheath, the next station-,
is Govett’s Leap, the grand lookout over the great
canyon of the Grose Valley. The Grose is the
grandest and deepest of all the mountain valleys,
and Govett’s Leap must be placed amongst the
finest of the attractions of the Blue Mountains.
In the vicinity are Evans’ Look-out and the
Rodriquez Pass, another mountain defile, through
magnificent scenery between Evans’ Look-out,
Govett’s Leap, and the Grand Canyon.
Mount Victoria, the last of the mountain tourist
stations, lies on the brink of the Hartley Vale,
one of the most fertile of the mountain indenta-
tions, whose vast expanse can be surveyed from
Mount York or Mount Piddington, two noble
eminences within easy distance of the town. It
is an important tourist station, and through it
passes the heavy traffic to the Jenolan Caves.
So wonderfully prolific in beauty spots are
these renowned Blue Mountains, that each of the
fifteen main tourist railway stations on the range

has its own enticing array of satellites—bush
rambles by valley, crag, and fall, which during
the year are visited by thousands whose stay
on the mountains invariably proves delightful
and benefiting. The rustic paths leading to the
special places of interest are maintained in good
order by Government grants of money, controlled
by trustees.
Excellent accommodation is available anywhere
on the mountains, and at the larger centres, motors
and wagonettes may be hired in which to do
the sights.
Continuing beyond Mount Victoria, the western
railway leads to some fine tourist centres on the
Central Tablelands, noted chiefly for their rest-
fulness and bracing climate, and for the induce-
ments they hold out to trout fishers. Some 20
miles beyond Mount Victoria, the line traverses
the Lithgow Valley, one of the most important
industrial centres in the Continent, and the home
of the iron industry in Australia.
Rydal, the first of the main resorts of the Cen-
tral Tablelands, is no miles from Sydney. Tarana
is a few miles further on, and from either of these

places good roads lead to Oberon and Gingkin,
Yetholme, another beautiful holiday resort lies
six miles from Wambool station, near Bathurst.
All these places are situated at an altitude as
great as the Blue Mountains, and Gingkin is 4,000
feet above sea level. They are surrounded by wild
mountainous scenery, the hills and valleys being
clothed with eucalypts, ferns, and wattles. The
bracing climate has gained for them a solid reputa-
tion as health resorts, and they furnish a most
beneficial change of air and scene. Gingkin and
Oberon lie within easy distance of the Jenolan
Caves, and riding parties from the accommodation
houses often visit the Caves and return the same
day. The Duckmaloi, Fish, and Abercrombie
Rivers, and other excellent trouting waters are
close to Oberon and Tarana, and in the hills in
the vicinity good shooting may be had. A good
idea is to take the round trip from Tarana or
Rydal to Oberon and the Jenolan Coves, return-
ing via Mount Victoria, or vice versa.
A regular line of Motor-cars now picks up pas-
sengers at any of the Mountain Stations from
Lawson for the Jenolan Caves.
Coaches also leave Mount Victoria daily; fare,

Geological.—The Agency of Water.
The vastness of the depth and extent of the
precipitous gorges and valleys of the Blue Moun-
tains inspire one with the feelings of silent awe


and wonder, and impress the minds of some per-
sons with the notion that such enormous ravines
in the mountains must have required violent con-
vulsions in the earth’s crust for their formation;
but if we examine the rocks on all sides of the
valley we see no breaks nor signs of violent dis-
turbance. The various beds of rock in horizontal
strata may be seen to continue uninterruptedly
around the sides of the valley, and the succeeding
layers of rock, as we descend one side of the ravine
gradually approach the corresponding layers on
the other side, until at the bottom, in the bed of
the watercourse, we find that they actually join,
which they would not do if the sides of the ravine
had been violently torn asunder. We perceive,
therefore, that the various outcropping strata must
once have been continuous right across the valley
or ravine, and that they have been removed by
some agency without disturbance of the under-
laying beds. What then is the agency? Not
volcanic fire, but running water. Look at the
sloping surface of any earth cuttings or embank-
ments that have been exposed to rain action;
see the miniature ranges and intervening valleys
that the water draining off has furrowed out.
Notice the minature precipices left where the har-
der earth material has resisted the action of the
running water; also at the bottom of the embank-
ment, where the incline ceases and the water flows
gently, how it deposits in minature alluvial flats
the earth it has scooped out and washed down
from above. Now could we look down from a
considerable height, and, as it were, take a bird’s
eye view of the Blue Mountains, exactly similar
features would be presented to us as we observed
in the earth embankment. Wherever the soft clay
strata of the Coal Measures exist, there are sloping
surfaces; where the Hawkesbury rocks appear,
there are cliffs; while the easily-disintegrated clay-
beds have been washed away, even to the under-
mining the overlying sandstone. The latter has
resisted to a great extent the denuding agencies,
and been left in projecting masses which, at last,
having the supporting soft strata removed, break
away and roll in great bosses down the sides of the


hill, perhaps as far as into the bed of the stream
below, a perpendicular cliff being left where they
broke away from the main mass of rock.
The only considerable valleys which can be
classed as originally inaccessible (though, of course,
no valley any more than any mountain is abso-
lutely so) seem to be the Yosemite, in California,
and the valleys of the Grose and Cox Rivers, in
New South Wales. In some respects the valleys
carved out of the great sandstone plateau of New
South Wales are even more remarkable than the
Yosemite itself. The ravines which discharge their
waters into the little Cox River occupy an area of
1,212 square miles. The whole forms the basin of
this mountain stream, and is bounded by cliffs
increasing from about 1,000 feet near its outlet to
about 2,500 feet near its western limits; the valley
bottom being not much above sea-level, and the
only outlet being through a gorge about a third
of a mile wide. Some considerable amount of
decay is still going on in the giant cliffs of the
Blue Mountains. Though in the life of a man a
block may seem unchanged, in a few thousand
years it may have entirely disappeared, and such
a lapse of time probably bears a less proportion
to the period occupied by the valley formation
than does a single hour to the life of a man. Every
characteristic the valleys possess is fully explained
by that simple theory of earth sculpture by atmos-
pheric agency.
In the westward portion of the Blue Mountains
the soft strata of the Coal Measures, which under-
lie the sandstones of the Hawkesbury Series, stand
high, and have thus been much exposed to denuda-
tion, and have led to a constant undermining of
the sandstones wherever these softer rocks have
been brought within reach of denuding agencies.
As, however, the soft strata of the Permo-carbon-
iferous Coal Measures dip eastward, it follows that
in the east portion of the Blue Mountains the
rivers leave the strata of the Coal Measures and
flow over the hard sandstones of the Hawkesbury
Series, so that no undermining action is possible
on the eastern area; hence the narrowness of the
river gorges near the eastern escarpment.

Jenolan and other CaVes.
By a pleasant route which lies over the Blue
Mountains, the Jenolan Caves, the most famous
of the State’s systems, are reached —this being a
two-days’ trip from Sydney.
Mount Victoria is the nearest railway station
for the journey to the Jenolan Caves, but a
regular line of motors takes passengers from any
of the mountain stations between Lawson and
Mount Victoria.
The drive from Mount Victoria to Jenolan —
36 miles in length—lies across undulating country,
and passes the broad valleys of Hartley and
Kanimbla, both fertile and picturesque. The
Kanimbla Valley from the Jenolan Caves road is a
magnificent spectacle. The last 5 miles of the
journey is by a circling descent down a mountain’s
side, terminating by a most inspiring rush through
the centre of a mountain by way of the Grand
Arch. This is a natural water-worn tunnel
through the heart of a limestone mountain, and
above the arch a great, rugged frowning cliff,
towers some hundreds of feet.
For all who are responsive to the attractions
of the beautiful blended with the mysterious, the
wonderful limestone caverns which exist in different
parts of New South Wales afford, in their sub-
terranean vaults and corridors of living rock,
scenes of transcendent beauty which the experience
of the dweller in the upper world can offer nothing
to parallel. Deep in the recesses of the earth lie
fairy palaces, supported on fluted columns, hung
with magic tapestries woven of shining stone, and
draped with delicate lacework whose filaments are
spun by water-sprites from the hard rock of the
earth’s inmost fastnesses. Here the trickling waters
through countless aeons of time, have eaten away
the limestone, and in their constant dripping have
built up from the material held in solution, wonder-
ful stalactites and stalagmites, whose mysterious
shapes seem to have been evolved by the sorcery
of the mountain gnomes. The sensations evoked
by a first visit to this underground wonderland

are absolutely unique, and the experience of
exploring the recesses of these wizard caverns is
one never to be forgotten. Here the conditions
of ordinary sight-seeing are totally reversed. The
explorer abandons the light of day for the black-
ness of mid-earth —a blackness to be dispelled by
the bright gleam of the electric light as it illumin-
ates chambers which might well be the abode of
one of the Genii of the Arabian Nights, or by the
brilliancy of the magnesium lights as they afford
glimpses of scenes of surpassing beauty and
strangeness.
It is quite impossible to obtain from any picture
or photograph anything approaching an adequate
idea of the manifold beauties of these caverns:
for the painter’s art, the conditions of cave explor-
ing present the greatest difficulties; while a

photograph, however good, gives but a cold image
of the wonderful reality —one loses all the rich
colouring, the gradations through numberless
tints, the striking contrasts of the deepest chocolate
with the most perfect white; and above all, the
dazzling splendour as the brilliant light is reflected
from millions of facets in the snowy curtains and
slender pillars. To realise the wonders of these
caves, they must be seen; and the holiday-maker
who seeks a novel form of enjoyment could hardly
do better than experience the fascination of their
mysterious loveliness.
Included in the wonders to be seen in the
magnificent series of caverns at Jenolan is the
Crystal City, with tiny ramparts and walls of
crystal. In the left Imperial Cave are the Studios
and the Crystal Caskets. In the Lucas Cave,
which is entered near the summit of the hill,
above the Grand Arch, is the mighty Cathedral,
an immense cavern of imposing height and majesty,
and richly decorated. The Nettle and Arch Caves,
entered high in the lofty galleries of the Devil’s
Coach-house, with their colossal, monstrous shapes,
impart a similar sense of vastness. The Devil’s
Coach Hou c e is a cave of gigantic dimensions.

The height of its dome exceeds that of the General
Post Office at Sydney, which building would fit
bodily into its mighty gulf. For beauty, variety,
and grandeur, it would be difficult to imagine any-
thing to surpass the caverns of the new branches
of the Lucas Cave; here there are hanging
shawls with translucent white bands alternating
with very dark stripes, clear pools with
crystal floors, and massive fluted columns 30
feet in height. The Skeleton Cave derives its
name from the discovery therein of a human
skeleton embedded in the rock. The Jubilee Cave,
decorated throughout with pure white stalactites,
here and there relieved by others of an amber
tint; and the Aladdin Cave, embellished with
clear crystals that sparkle like stars, are exquisitely
beautiful, and once seen, linger long in one’s
memory. Recently a new cave, the Temple
of Baal, has been opened for public inspection,
and the glorious natural ornaments are if anything
richer in their splendour and of more abiding
interest than the older caves mentioned. But it
would require a volume even to outline the more
prominent of the long series of wonderful sights
\vith which these caves abound: a few, including

this underground fairyland.
There are other cave systems in the great
limestone belt of New South Wales—Yarrango-
billy, Wombeyan, Abercrombie, and Wellington;
and in. each of these entrancing formations,
similar in character to those of Jenolan, yet
each possessing features peculiar and distinct.
Yarrangobilly has its wondrous stalagmites with
domes and spires resembling the splendours of
the best types of Indian architecture; the Wom-
beyan Caverns are noted for the wonderful bril
liancy of colouring in their formations, and their
unique basins; the Wellington Caves are intensely
interesting on account of their fossil-beds, con-
taining skeletons of huge, long-extinct Australian
marsupials; at Abercrombie there is the mighty
Abercrombie Archway, with its branching wonder-
caverns .

The Hawkesbury District .
This magnificent tourist district has its own
unique attractions. It embraces many beautiful
holiday and health resorts, and includes the
Kuring-gai Chase, an immense natural Park of
35,000 acres. Sixteen miles from Port Jackson,
an entrance two miles wide leads into Broken
Bay, into which the Hawkesbury flows. 1 his
is a favourite locality with artists, yachtsmen,
fishermen, sportsmen, pleasure-seekers, and tourists
from everywhere. It impresses the visitor with
a sense of solitude —of lonely grandeur, and gives
the feeling which stole over Scott, when he wrote,
on visiting St. Mary’s Loch :
Your horse’s hoof-tread sounds too rude,
So stilly is the solitude.
The bay branches into long arms of deep water.
To the south is the broad, quiet Pittwater; to
the north the calm surface of Brisbane Water
reflects the dark hill-sides; and between them
the Hawkesbury silently merges in the ocean.
Further westward are the large and beautiful
tributaries of Cowan and Berowra. Numerous
narrow but navigable estuaries penetrate far by
sandstone gorges into the heart of the hills past
Windsor and Penrith. Dark and unruffled lie
these fiord-like waters, overshadowed by cliffs half
a thousand feet high, and thickly wooded to the
rocky foreshores. Here and there are beaches of
-:uddy gold, which make a bright contrast with
the green of the foliage in the background. A
handsome steel railway bridge, with a total
length of 2,896 feet between abutments, spans
the Hawkesbury just where it widens into the
estuary. This bridge, which is about three-
quarters of a mile in length, is the longest on the
continent, and, as regards its foundations, one of
the most remarkable in the world. Ihe caissons
upon which the six piers rest vary in depth from
100 to 162 feet.
The scenery of the Hawkesbury is generally
considered to be as fine as any in the wide world.


.'tH E HAWKESBURY RIVER, NEAR WINDSOR.
Anthony Trollope, who visited Australia some
years ago, wrote of it: —“ Govett’s Leap (on
the Blue Mountains) astonished me very much,
but not, I think, so much as the scenery of the
Hawkesbury River. There may be special points
in other streams which have endeared themselves
to the world —such especially as the Falls of
Niagara—such as the Inn at Innsbruck—or the
Rhine at Geneva—or the Upper Lake at Killarney,
which is in truth a river, but for continued scenery
the Rhine stands first. There is a river, or rather
a portion of the river, known to very few tourists,
which, I think, beats the Rhine: this is the Upper
Mississippi, for about 150 miles below St. Paul.
It is not my business here to describe the Missis-
sippi; but I mention it with the object of saying
that in my opinion the Hawkesbury beats the
Mississippi. I should not make the contrast
unless there were many features in the two which
are similar At all of them the
banks rise suddenly, sometimes covered with
timber and sometimes bald—sometimes sloping
and sometimes precipitous—but at all of them the


HOUSE-BOAT, COWAN CREEK
banks are broken here and there into lateral
valleys, which give to the imagination the idea
that the glory of the scene is far spread, and
would repay pursuit. Unless it can convey this
vague feeling of distant, unapproachable, and
almost mysterious delight, scenery loses half its
charms. On the Rhine, on the Mississippi, and
on the Hawkesbury alike, there is created an idea
that if the traveller would only leave the boat
and wander inland, he would be repaid by the
revelation of marvellous beauties of Nature —
beauties which have, perhaps, never yet met the
eyes of man.
“ The lower part of the river—that between
Wiseman’s Ferry and Pittwater, which is a large
inlet of the sea running southward from Broken
Bay—is very much finer than the upper reaches.
“ The Rhine has its castles and its islands, and
it has, too, in its favour the bright colour of its
waters. The Upper Mississippi has no castles, nor
are its waters bright; but it has islands and
innumerable bluffs and headlands, and varied
valleys, and park-like timber, and its own fast-
running rush of waters, which are to me more

than compensation for castles and the colour.
The Hawkesbury has neither castles nor islands,
nor has it bright, clear waters like the Rhine;
but the headlands are higher, and the bluffs are
bolder, and the turns and manoeuvres of the
course which the waters have made for themselves
are grander, and, to me, more enchanting than
those of either the European or American river.”
From Colah to a point near the Hawkesbury the
railway runs for a distance of n miles by the
western boundary of the Kuring-gai Chase —a
magnificent extensive pleasure resort, which will in
future years become a most cherished possession.
The Chase is one of the favourite week-end
resorts of the city dwellers, who enjoy a respite
amid its glorious scenery, and take advantage of
its fishing attractions. In the Chase, nature is
as yet undefiled, and though the place of many
enchanting fern-clad dells and secluded bowers in
the hollow of the hills beneath the shade of
towering monarchs of the forest is faintly marked
by foot prints on the leaf-strewn ground, probably
as many others lie hidden, where the foot of man
has never trod.


A PEEP ON THE MACDONALD RIVER
At present Kuring-gai Chase enjoys a wide
popularity, although it has only been dedicated
since 1894. It covers an area of over 35,000
acres, almost as great as the National Park,
and it embraces picturesque, rugged mountain
ranges, gorges, and saltwater estuaries similar
to the Hawkesbury scenery described so
eloquently by Anthony Trollope. It is specially
rich in natural flora. It is an ideal place
for camping, and within recent years many
facilities have been afforded for traversing its
devious length with a minimum of discomfort.
The waters of the Chase abound in snapper,
red bream, black bream, whiting, and carp, as
well as excellent oyster-beds.
On Cowan Creek, an arm of the Hawkesbury,
which bisects the Chase, are several house-boats,
which may be hired at a small cost, with wood,
water, and every convenience provided.
A most convenient, popular, and cheap way of
seeing the glories of the Hawkesbury, is by the
round trip via Manly, Newport, and Pitt water.
A start is made in the morning by one of the fine

ferry steamers to Manly. From Manly, coaches
are taken to Newport via Narrabeen, over 12 miles
of good road which skirts the coast the whole way,
and commands many glorious views of the mag-
nificent chain of golden ocean beaches and coastal
promontories. The run from Newport via the
Pittwater to Hawkesbury Station embraces many
miles of exquisite river scenery.
The tranquil reaches of the Upper Hawkesbury
may be visited on special trips twice a week.
From the Hawkesbury to Wiseman’s Ferry and
on to the historic town of Windsor, the tourist
passes through the quiet beauty of many silent
reaches, which have an abiding charm. As the
steamer glides along the glassy surface of the
water, varied natural pictures unfold themselves,
as each spur is circled, and all around is a fascinat-
ing stillness.

The J\orthern Lakes and
/livers.
The central point of the Great Lakes District is
Newcastle, the coal port, which, of the towns of
the State, is second in importance only to the
Capital. Newcastle similarly enjoys beautiful sur-
roundings, and its environs offer many facilities
for magnificent drives, and its neighbouring ocean
beaches are charming holiday spots, where the
delights of the pre-eminent aquatic sport —surf-
bathing, may be indulged in.
Lying between the Hawkesbury River and
Newcastle, and intersected by the Great Northern
Railway, a chain of lagoons, known as the Northern
Lakes, stretches along the coast. They are Cock-
rone, Bulbararing, Terrigal, Wamberal, Tuggerah
Lakes (a chain of three, 20 miles in length), and
Lake Macquarie, and they constitute the most
beautiful lacustrine district of the State.
To the north of Newcastle, and within a few
miles of it, lies another extensive chain of rivers
and lakes, whose extraordinary beauty is at
present but little known. The broad sheet of
water called Port Stephens, with its branching
waterways—the Upper and Lower Myall Rivers,
the Broadwater, the Upper and Lower Booloom-
bayt, the Karuah, the Great Myall Lake, Smith’s
Lake, and Wallis Lake, constitute a water-maze
of great compass and exquisite beauty, which
stands unrivalled.
Tourists could spend at least a month in exploring
these lakes and the intervening beaches. The bush
—dense jungle of a truly tropical character —in
the vicinity of Kincumber, the Narara, Ourimbah,
Wyong, which lie along the northern railway line
between the Hawkesbury and Newcastle, and
around Salt Ash, Nelson’s Bay, Bulladelah,
Wingham, and Taree, which may be reached
either by steamer from Sydney or overland from
Newcastle, is the haunt of the magnificent
lyre bird (menura superha), the most wonderful


TORONTO, LAKE MACQUARIE.
mocking bird that exists, the wonga, and a
large variety of other pigeons, the bower-bird,
cat-bird, the splendid regent-bird, parrots,
cockatoos, and innumerable others of the
feathered tribes. The lakes swarm with water-
fowl and fish, while wallabies and kangaroos
are also obtainable in the adjacent forests.
The best-known of the lakes are Tuggerah
and Macquarie. They are easily reached, and, as
they are magnificent fishing grounds, they naturally
attract great numbers of tourists. Lake Macquarie
is a fashionable resort of Newcastle residents. It
is a magnificent sheet of water, and its shoreline
has a greater extent than that of Sydney Har-
bour. A favourite resort on the Lake is Toronto,
easily reached by train in a few hours from
Sydney. The surrounding scenery is picturesque
and entrancing, and the whole country-side peace-
ful and quiet. Among the meadows the little
inlets break, and many a fern-fringed stream glides
beneath gigantic towering trees. The place is
fairly extensively farmed, and the ripening crops
in the season enhance the beauty of the land-
scape. In the holiday season the lake is a centre
of life and activity, and its surface is crowded
with small craft of all sizes, shapes, and build.
Port Stephens and the Myall Lakes possess
features which in many respects resemble the
better-known district of Lake Macquarie. These

resorts may be reached either direct by steamer
from Sydney, or overland from the railway at
Newcastle. The drives to the different points
of interest in the district, for the most part
lie along well-made roads which intersect
country vet in the infant stages of development.
The Myall (upper and lower) and the Karuah
Rivers, and all the Lakes have many very pretty
reaches. On the Manning River are situated
the important centres of Taree and Wingham.
The surrounding country is rich and fertile,
and from many points in the vicinity excellent
panoramic views are procurable. Lying 24 miles
from Wingham are the Ellenborough Falls, which
plunge sheer for a distance of 700 feet. Their
surroundings are most attractive and beautiful,
and it is doubtful whether the State has any falls
more magnificent than these.
The characteristic feature of this region is its
air of restful quiet. For the tired brain and
over-wrought nerves of the city dweller, the
district is an ideal one for a respite trip. For
those who desire a temporary release from con-
ventionalities, many splendid camping grounds
will be found in convenient places, and no other
district has better attractions for an extended
holiday, or affords such a grand change of habit,
air and scene.

JSfew England District.
The New England Tableland District is one
little known to visitors to the State, but residents
have long ago realised its great attractions as
a summer holiday resort. In addition to the
bracing air, due to its elevation—some 3,500 feet—
there is splendid shooting and trout-fishing, while
the district abounds in scenic gems. Some of the
finest scenery in Australia is to be found in the
gorges of the Upper Macleay, the Cockburn Valley
and Moonbi Ranges, and on the wild hills in the
vicinity of Uralla and Walcha.
The chief industries of the district are wool-
growing, wheat-farming, dairying, and mining.
Some of the New England wheat-fields are mag-
nificent, and many of the finest samples of wheat
grown in the State come from them.
The three largest centres in the district are Armi-
dale, Tam worth, and Glen Innes. New England
has a cool invigorating climate, and is greatly
availed of during the summer months by the
citizens of the northern State. From any
of these centres excursions may be arranged
to rugged mountain scenery and waterfalls,
whose volume of water is greater than the Blue
Mountain falls. They leap and thunder over
great boulders singing their tremendous hymns.
At Moonbi, near Tamworth, begins the ascent
of the ranges which fringe the New England
tableland. The road for several miles climbs
through some most picturesque scenery. There
are great round hills, forest-clad from base
to apex, overshadowing deep gullies where the
mountain torrents rush foaming over tumbled
boulders. Now and then glimpses may be had of
the wider valley lands below, framed by the crags
of rifted mountains. In the bottoms of the wild
ravines, fern-trees spread their green circle of
shade, and the eucalypts stand straight and tall.
About 16 miles south-east of Walcha are
Apsley Falls, which must be reckoned amongst


GUY FAWKES FALLS, ARMIDALE.
the finest in the State. Here the abrupt break
from the tableland into the massive gorges and
fertile valleys of the eastern slope affords the
traveller panoramas of surpassing beauty. Walcha,
Armidale, and Glen Innes are the chief centres for
the famous trout streams of the northern table-
land. In the tree-clad gorges of the locality'
gold and precious stones have been discovered,
and the mineral output of the district with
that of Uralla is considerable. The best trout
waters near Walcha are the McDonald, Cobra-
bald, Cockburn, and Ingleba Rivers, and several
creeks. Good shooting at rabbits and wallabies
is obtainable, and at quail in the season. The
neighbourhood of Uralla still echoes with the deeds
of olden days, when the notorious bushranger
Thunderbolt held the roads.


ON THE PEEL RIVER, TAMWORTH.
Tamworth —one of the State’s most important
inland towns —is picturesquely situated on the
banks of the Peel River, at the foot of a chain of
hills. It lies in the centre of one of the State’s
richest wheat districts, through which many
charming drives along good roads may be had.
The Cathedral City of Armidale, stands amidst
picturesque hills and open downs, which are ex-
ceedingly fertile. In the mountain chain, within a
few miles distance, there is scenery of the wildest
beauty. Down rugged gorges, flanked by precipit-
ous cliffs, flow creeks which in rainy weather
are clamorous and fierce, and leap from chasm
to chasm in foaming cataracts. The Armidale
private school has established its claim to be one
of the finest boys’ schools in the State. The
most noted resorts close to Armidale are Baker
Creek, Dangar, Emu, Guy Fawkes, Styx, and
Wollombi Falls. In all these streams, and in the
Guyra and Gostwyck Rivers, good trouting may
be had. At Hillgrove, where the rugged mountains


UPPER FALLS, GUY FAWKES, ARVIDALE.
tumble in close folds making steep and deep
gorges, the scenery is magnificent, and this district
is one of the finest that lies out of the beaten track
of tourists.
Glen Innes, a pretty and prosperous town, lies
amid hilly, granite country alternating with fertile
plains. Its climate is cool and bracing. A few
miles from town a Government Experimental Farm
of 1,250 acres has been established, with an orchard
planted with apples, pears, gooseberries, and other
cool climate fruits which flourish in these uplands.
Glen Innes is an important tin-mining centre.


EMU CREEK FALLS, ARMIDALE.
Old Ben Lomond, a solemn and solitary peak,
the highest point on the tableland —-3,518 feet —is
within easy driving distance of Glen Innes. The
best of the many fine trout waters near Glen
Innes are the Beardy River —which winds round
the town and may be tapped at many points at
close range —and the Waterloo, Mann, Nymboida,
Severn, Yarrow, and other streams. Cod and carp
are often caught, particularly in the Beardy. The
district also offers good shooting.
On the western slopes of the New England
tableland, at Moree, are fine baths of natural
thermal waters from an artesian bore. The
waters flow at a temperature of 114 0 , but the
water in the bath is cooled to ioo°. These
waters have been frequently proved to be highly
beneficial in the treatment of sciatica, rheuma-
tism, and nervousness. Moree is a pastoral town
on the branch railway from Werris Creek, at
a distance of 400 miles from the Capital.

The J\orth Coast District.
The Northern Rivers District, lying between
the Hunter River Valley and the northern border
of New South Wales, and bounded on the west
by the great dividing range, is a vast stretch of
rich fertile country, intersected by a number of
magnificent rivers, is an ideal winter tourist
district. Between April and November the
weather in the northern rivers is comfortably
warm. There is no winter as the term is under-
stood in the southern latitudes, and an air
of novelty and interest is lent to the scene
by the sub-tropical vegetation that fringes the
the splendid rivers close to the Queensland
border. The districts present a wealth of wonder-
ful scenery and ideal holiday resorts. Here the
pleasure-seeker can find the enjoyment and recrea-
tion which most specially appeal to him —boating
on the great quiet rivers; riding; driving; cycling;
shooting; fishing and climbing. The district is
easy of access. The tourist can leave Sydney late
on Saturday night, and wake on Monday morning
within the heads of the broad Clarence. Grafton,
the chief city of the rivers, can be reached the same
forenoon after a most interesting journey on the
river, and the tourist can at will depart for fresh
fields and pastures new by the railway sweeping
north into the heart of this rich and wonderful
country, or remain to explore the varied attrac-
tions of the Clarence. An alternative route is by
rail via Brisbane and the south coast of Queens-
land. The upper waters of the Clarence presents
some t uly magnificent scenery with rugged cliffs
and foaming cascades; and the whole of the
North Coast district, from the Clarence on the
south to the sub-tropical wonders of the beautiful
Tweed, is a happy hunting-ground for the holiday-
maker.
The district is responsible for two of the
State’s most potent sources of wealth—the dairy-
ing industry and the timber industry. This

is unquestionably the most fertile tract of
country in the Continent, and within the last

maize growing, its progress and development has
been phenomenal. Two of the State’s finest country

towns—Lismore and Casino —may be said to be of
mushroom growth. The quality of the soil and
the copious rainfall ensure a plentiful supply of
grass and crops, and the mildness of the climate
permits of dairying being carried on throughout

the whole year. Lismore, the “ Queen City of the
North,” is the busiest of towns, and has all the
signs of healthy vitality and progressiveness. The
railway line connects Lismore with Murwillumbah,
a beautiful and thriving town on the Tweed,
running through a country of tropical climate
and luxuriance of vegetation. In the Big Scrub
stand side by side the tall columns of the
teak, the straight shaft of the pine, and the
verdurous mass of the cedar. Figs and palms
grow in the all-but-impenetrable jungle, with
tallow-wood, ironbark, beech, black bean, red
bean and rosewood—an endless wealth of timbers
hard and soft —and from every tree festoons of
creepers fall to the luxuriant growth of ferns below.
A few years ago there was a dense profusion
of vegetable beauty all along the line from
Lismore to the Tweed. But the Big Scrub
has been giving way before axe and saw
and fire, and now sleek, well-conditioned cattle
browse upon green hills where the jungle grew,
and where myriads of birds once sang in the
solitude of the bush. There is an unwearying

variety of scenery in this district —one sees moun-
tains, fat pastures, still some cane-fields, innumer-
able streams, and glimpses of the open sea.
Byron Bay, where the cooling ozone-laden
breezes blow in from the ocean, lies at the back
of the sand dunes which fringe the sweeping
ocean beach. At the southern end of this
crescent-shaped beach the solidly-built light-
house, flashing its rays of warning and welcome,
crowns a noble headland, whose rugged seaward
slopes are mottled with grassy patches and thick
groves of scrub. At the northern extremity of
the bay is Cape Byron, the most easterly point
of the continent. Behind Cape Byron the majes-
tic Mount Warning rears its giant form, and its
contour is strongly outlined against the heavens.
From the centre of the beach a great pier runs
out into the sea. The railroad between Bangalow
and Byron Bay passes through a magnificent forest
of sub-tropical vegetation, amid which the

graceful forms of the bangalow palms show pro-
minently, and when the summit of the hill over-
looking Byron Bay is attained, a panorama of
superlative grandeur is revealed. The opposite
side of the range just surmounted is similarly
rich in flora, and slopes gently towards the broad
extent of park-like country stretching away to
the sea-shore, the shining ocean in the distance,
from the height, appearing like a stupendous
indigo ball. The view is unobstructed to the
right or left, and in all directions the country
may be surveyed to the limit of vision.
The co-operative creamery at Byron Bay is one
of the largest in the world, the annual output
reaching thousands of tons and the turnover
nearly £700,000.
Murwillumbah, another thriving North Coast
town, has a beautiful situation on the banks of
the Tweed. The flora and fauna of the scrub
lands of the Tweed are full of interest. Among
the more beautiful trees are the cedar, the nettle,
different families of figs, on which the wild pigeons
feed, the black bean and red bean, with glossy
foliage and large pods. Animal life is plentiful in
the scrub, which is the haunt of the wallaby, his
smaller kinsman —the paddymelon, the blunt-
faced stupid native bear, the kindly-eyed opossum,


NAMBUCCA RIVEH, NEAR MACKSVILLE.
the brush turkey, the orange and black-coated
regent bird with shining dark-green breast, pigeons
and doves of many varieties, and the whirring
quail.
What has been said of the portions of this
district described, is merited in no lesser degree
by the scenic splendours of the other North Coast
rivers—the Clarence, Richmond, Bellinger, Nam-
bucca, Macleay, or Hastings. The whole territory
embraced by them is yet a wilderness of truly
grand scenery, which, however, is being gradually
encroached upon by the sturdy yeomanry, engaged
in the pursuits of dairying and agriculture. The
stern grandeur of the rugged ranges fills the heart
with a feeling of loneliness, while the peaceful
loveliness of the rivers, the busy healthy farming
life on the plains, and the orchestral sounds of
the rolling ocean, each have their peculiar and
befitting sensations.
Between the Orara and Bellinger Rivers are
dense forests from which the largest supply of the
State’s magnificent hardwood timbers is drawn.
Between these two streams, are the Dorrigo and
Comboyne Districts, covering one of the richest

tracts of virgin country in the State, the exploita-
tion of which has only recently been commenced.
At the mouth of the Orara on the coast, is the
town of Coff’s Harbour with an excellent port,
destined to be one of the largest of the northern
towns. Next to it, making southwards, is Bellingen,
on the banks of the river of the same name; then
follow Bowra and Nambucca on the Nambucca
River. Kempsey, one of the largest river towns
is on the Macleay, in the centre of a rich agricultural
and grazing district. The Macleay waters an
exceedingly fertile tract, and its banks are lined
with thriving grain crops, chiefly maize. Port
Macquarie near the southernmost end of the district,
standing at the mouth of the Hastings, is an
important seaport and a great timber shipping
centre. It is one of the oldest towns in the State,
and has many interesting historical relics. Just to
the south of it is Lake Innes. The scenery round
Port Macquarie, consisting chiefly of forest and
meadow, is exceedingly beautiful, and drives along
fine roads may be taken through it.

The Southern Highlands .
The healthy, cool, bracing climate of the country
from Picton to Goulburn, traversed by the Southern
Line, and its springs of health-giving mineral
waters, has established its fame as a sanatorium.
It is in this region that the renowned recreation
resorts of Thirlmere, Mittagong, Bowral, Moss
Vale, Bundanoon, and Exeter are situated within
a few miles of each other. From Picton an
excursion may be arranged to the sunken Burra-
gorang Valley, one of the grandest in the State,
where the scenery is of the wildest grandeur,
and from several points on the road expansive
bird’s-eye views are obtainable of stretches
of country, reminiscent of the Blue Mountains.
The chain of Picton Lakes, which spread over
a length of five miles, embracing some fascin-
atingly beautiful scenery, are within six miles
of the station, and are easy of access. A
few miles beyond Picton the line enters a
thickly-timbered district, and then rough sand-
stone country, up the steep gradients of which
the train toils with difficulty through long,
deep cuttings, till at Mittagong, it reaches an
elevation of 2,069 feet. This portion of the table-
land including Mittagong, Bowral, Burradoo,
Bong Bong, and Moss Vale—is one of the most
frequented and fashionable health resorts in the
State. Between Mittagong and Bowral the train
passes by a tunnel beneath a mountain spur
known as the Gib, from its fancied resemblance
to the famous rock at Gibraltar. From the top
of the Gib, on clear days, fine views are obtain-
able, and even the ocean is visible away in the
dim distance. The roads in this district are
splendid for walking, cycling, motoring, or driving,
and Bowral and Moss Vale lie within 40 miles of
the Wombeyan Caves by a good road. These
caves are connected with Goulburn by a regular
service of motor cars. (See page 61.)
Both Mittagong and Bowral have a healthy
and salubrious climate, and many pleasant ferny


ROAD THROUGH FERN AND BRAKE ON CAMBEWARRA MOUNTAIN,
nooks, babbling cascades and murmuring water-
falls may be reached by short agreeable walks
from the town. Mittagong possesses a chalybeate
spring—a powerful iron tonic —whose waters are
efficacious in the treatment of nervous complaints.
The Macquarie Pass, which leads from the
tableland through the Illawarra District to the
Coast, is reached by a good road, 17 miles from
Bowral. This rugged mountain defile is remark-
able for its exuberance of beautiful forest and
fern growth, and its many vantage points com-
manding expansive panoramic views, which take 1
in the fertile stretches of the Illawarra. The
picturesque Carrington Falls are 5 miles further on.
Two miles from the Moss Vale station, in the
neighbourhood of Sutton Forest, lies “ Hill View,”
the country seat of the Governor of the State.
About 12 miles from Moss Vale, by a good
road, over pleasant undulating country, are the
celebrated Fitzroy Falls. The road is followed
till it comes suddenly to the very verge of a deep
sunken valley. Over the rocky cliff into this

valley a tributary of the Shoalhaven River takes
a preliminary leap of 400 feet to the huge boulders
at the foot, after which it plunges in a second
cataract a further distance of 200 feet. The
surrounding scenery is charming. The gorge,
which is about half a mile wide and 1,000 feet
deep, stretches away into the hazy distance. From
the bottom of the scarred cliffs steep wooded
slopes descend to the bed of the stream, and
from these slopes many varieties of forest trees
rear their mighty forms skywards, the foliage
being thickly matted and garlanded with native
climbers.
Eastward, a table-shaped mountain, called Mount
Meryla, projects into the widening valley, and far
beyond it retreating lines of hills stretch away to
the horizon.
The Belmore Falls, 2 miles further on, are
connected by a well-defined tourist road, arched
in many places by spreading trees. It is a
most charming rustic walk to these Falls, which
are no less beautiful than their neighbours. The
look-out at Belmore Falls enables one to gain a
magnificent view of the sweeping extent of the
fertile and picturesque Kangaroo Valley.


__
HEAD OF FITZROY FALLS.
The Fitzroy Falls lie along the well-known stretch
of 40 miles from Moss Vale to Nowra, the terminal
railway station of the South Coast system. Pro-
bably no more beautiful or popular tourist route
exists in the State. After leaving Fitzroy Falls
the descent is made of the Barrengarry Mountain
to the Kangaroo Valley, through a riotous pro-
fusion of xern growth, amid which numberless
gigantic tree-ferns tower above their smaller
kinsmen. After traversing the Kangaroo Valley,
a rich fertile tract carrying herds of sleek dairy
cattle, browsing peacefully in well-grassed meadow-
land surrounding comfortable homesteads, and
having crossed the suspension-bridge which spans
the clear-running stream which intersects the
valley, the ascent is made of Cambewarra Mountain,
which is quite as picturesque and beautiful as its
twin brother, just left behind. The descent from
the summit of Cambewarra into Nowra is glorious,
and the latter town, one of the most important
on the south coast, and the centre of an extensive
dairying district, is reached after passing across
the noble expanse of the broad Shoalhaven Valley.

FITZROY FALLS, MOSS VALE.


TWIN FALLS, NEAR MOSS VALE.
The river of that name flows silently by the town.
The magnificent Illawarra District, of which Nowra
is the terminal railway-station, has been described
in a previous chapter.
Special week-end tours are arranged over this
route.
Continuing on the southern line past Moss
Vale, the next centre worthy of notice is
Goulburn, one of the largest of the State’s
country towns, and the centre of the district
forming the boundary of the Southern Tableland.
Goulburn is a Cathedral City, situated on the Wol-
londilly, and surrounded by a fertile district, given
over principally to the pastoral, agricultural, and
fruit-growing industries. It possesses many splen-
did buildings, and is a solid business centre. The
district is not remarkable from the point of view
of its scenic resources, but it has a healthy climate
and is visited by many tourists throughout the
year. A service by motor-car now plies between
Goulburn and the Wombeyan Caves over a splen-
did road, 50 miles in length, leading through the
rich pastoral land round Chatsbury, Taralga, and
Richlands. (See page 61).

The Kosciusko Range oif
the ustration /t Ips .
The Kosciusko District is unique. It is one of
the most remarkable tourist districts in Australia,
and it has peculiar and distinctive characteristics
which make it equally attractive as a summer
or winter resort. It lies on the outskirts of
the Monaro Plains, and extends to the Victorian
border. The main centres are Cooma and Tumut.
Twelve hours’ journey in a fast, commodious,
well-ventilated train brings the visitor to the
rail-head at Cooma, in the midst of the vast
sweeping plains, within easy reach of the
Australian Alps, on which are snow-capped
Kosciusko, the loftiest peak in the continent;
Kiandra, the highest township in Australia;
and the far-famed Yarrangobilly Caves. Numerous
fast-running alpine streams, with waters clear as
crystal and teeming with trout, take their rise
in the perennial snow springs of the gorges of these
mountains. Duck and other waterfowl, which in
the season afford splendid sport for the gun, find
a habitat among the wilds of this region.
The journey to Kosciusko is generally via
Cooma, from which point visitors are conveyed
by motor over the 40 miles to The Creel, on the
Thredbo River, which is reached for lunch.
This route lies through a beautiful stretch of
country, and crosses the broad bosom of the
Monaro, passing by Berridale and Jindabyne, a
picturesque settlement on the banks of the Snowy
River.
During the summer special round tours are made
from Tumut to the Yarrangobilly Caves, Kiandra,
Mount Kosciusko, and thence to Cooma. This
journey may be taken in the reverse direction, and
a regular tri-weekly motor service has been estab-
lished between Tumut and the Creel at the foot-
hills, connecting with the motor and coach services
from Cooma and the Hotel Kosciusko.


EN ROUTE BY MOTOR FROM COOMA TO HOTEL KOSCIUSKO.
Tumut, one of the prettiest of country towns,
standing on the banks of the pellucid Tumut River,
shaded by groves of picturesque English trees, lies
in an exceedingly fertile valley. The drive to
Talbingo, 24 miles, on the way to Yarrangobilly
traverses the sylvan scenes of this charmingly
pretty Tumut Valley. At Talbingo a comfortable
hostelry stands at the foot of the big Talbingo
hill; two hurrying trout streams mingle their
limpid waters just at the rear of the hotel, and a
short distance away the rushing Buddong—in one
of the finest waterfalls in Australia —tumbles in
foaming torrents over a rugged gorge in the wild
Talbingo Range.
Continuing to Yarrangobilly, 23 miles, the way
lies across the Talbingo and Cumberland Ranges
to the cosy Government Accommodation House
on the picturesque Yarrangobilly River, where
good catches of fine trout are often made. A
delightful and health-giving bath may be indulged
in at the thermal spring, whose tepid waters
contain ingredients of great medicinal value.
The Yarrangobilly Caves, which rival in magni-
ficence the world-renowned Jenolan Caves, are
probably more extensive. They occur in a belt
of limestone, from half a mile to a mile in width
and 6or 7 miles long. The frontage of this belt
to the Yarrangobilly River is singularly impressive.


and battlemented
For miles precipices
outcrops dip their feet in the crystal waters of the
swift river. They are weatherworn, carved here
and there into grotesque shapes, scored and pitted
with holes and crevices, many of which indicate
entrances to unexplored caverns with which the
whole limestone range is honeycombed. Situated
on the side of a rugged hill frowning over the river,
the points of entrance to the caves afford a magnifi-
cent view of the neighbouring valley and its tower-?
ing bluffs. Internally the caves present similar
characteristics to Jenolan, referred to in another
chapter. There is a fine thermal bathing spring here.
The first point of call after leaving this beautiful
environment is Kiandra, 14 miles. In winter
Kiandra is completely snowed in, and cut off from
communication during June, July, and August,
when the only means of entering or leaving it is
by ski-running some 8 or g miles to the snow-line.
Kiandra has a famous ski-running course, and in
the vicinity of the township, some excellent trout
streams.


HOTEL KOSCIUSKO, SUMMER.


1. MOUNT TOWNSEND, ON THE KOSCIUSKO RIDGE.
2. LAKE ALBINA IN THE CLOUDS.
Adaminaby, 21 miles, the next settlement after
Kiandra, is a pretty hamlet in the valley of the
Eucumbene, and beyond it lies The Creel, 36 miles
—the famous Government fishing-box for trout-
fishers and mountaineers —on the banks of the
Thredbo, which pours down its torrents of cold,
translucent waters, and lies in the most picturesque
surroundings at the foothills of Kosciusko. It is
an ideal summer headquarters, for the stream
which roars past its doors is famous for its trout,
and all the sports of this season —shooting, swim-
ming, and fishing —may be enjoyed within its
precincts. Some glorious rambles may be taken
round about, and within half a mile is a fine
stretch of water at the confluence of the Snowy
and the Thredbo. That magnificent trio of snow-
born trouting streams —the Snowy, Thredbo, and
Eucumbene lie within easy distance of The
Creel. They have no superiors, being easily fished,


in
THE CREEL AT THREDBO.
and providing sport unexcelled by the famous
Scottish streams.
From The Creel the ascent of the mountain
giant is begun. The Hotel Kosciusko stands on
the uplands of the mountain 10 miles above The
Creel, and from it a splendid driving road leads to
the summit, 16 miles.
Humped above the ranges of foothills and com-
manding ridges of rugged mountains, Kosciusko
sits with one or two other sister peaks of almost
equal height, right in the heart of the Great Divide.
Australia’s, poverty of high hills is here forgotten,
and the native-born Australian traverses a new
world. Kosciusko is our highest mountain, but it
does not tower above its neighbours, a solitary
finger piercing the sky. It is a point, a slightly
higher hump than the others in a gigantic ridge
that forms the backbone of the Australian Alps.
The scenery at the summit is remarkably
grand, impressive, and memorable. In the
foreground, rugged granite crags stand in their
majesty, and their attendant deep and rocky
gorges gape at one’s very feet; in the centre-
ground the bold outlines of the nearer hills stand
clear and firm, while the distant prospect reveals
line beyond line of tree-covered ranges with
radiating spurs, reaching far away and retreating
through regular gradations of colouring, till the

furthermost is lost in the dim, shimmering haze of
delicate blue.
The vision embraces a wonderful prospect of
hills. Across the Victorian border, the stepping
ranges take the beholder deep down into Gipps-
land. Eastward lies the immense open valley
of the Snowy, a valley, or rather plateau,
stretching 70 miles to the soft blue rim of
the coastal range. Northwards lies Mount Twy-
nam, across the vast gorge of Agintoothbong,
which takes away in the Khancoban River, the
chief mass of snow-water from the western water-
shed. Just below the top is a narrow razorback
dividing the waters of the Murray and the Snowy.
Here rivers may be seen in their making, the
highest snowfields retaining through the hottest
summer patches of the drifts which pour trickling
streams into the first waters of the rivers. The
streamlets twine their way down through the
valley, gradually swelling as reinforced, until the
silver ribbon spreads wide and deep, and the river
is a thing in being.

CROSSING A DRIFT ON MOUNT KOSCIUSKO.
It is interesting to note that the mountain
presents great interest from a geological point of
view. “ The hoary top of Kosciusko is notable as
being one of the very oldest spots of land in this wide
world,” says a famous geologist. “ The European
Alps are old; the Himalayas are old; but Kosciusko
stood proudly above the sea, when of the Alps and
Himalayas not a stone was laid above a stone.
We date the age of continents or lands from the
time when they finally emerged from beneath the
sea. Reckoned in this way, Mount Kosciusko is
vastly older than any known land on the earth
to-day. The highest mountains are, it goes without
saying, not always the oldest. The Australian
Alps show no crags and peaks rising to altitudes of
eight to ten thousand feet, and clothed in eternal
snow. But their very age can account for this.
Millions of years of wear and tear have smoothed
down the crags of Kosciusko and rounded its peaks.
We have to-day, so to speak, the ruins of a moun-
tain. The giant slabs that are tossed in sublime
confusion on the highest point of land in Australia
are all that are left to tell of the days when its
head pierced the clouds.”

FUN ON THE SNOW.
Kosciusko has yet to be described in its most
unique aspect, when each year as the sun proceeds
on his northern track withdrawing his summer
heat from this hemisphere, the mantle of winter is
spread over these lofty ranges, and wood, vale,
and river is lacquered with a snowy film. It is in
winter garb that Kosciusko blossoms in all its
splendour. Snow lies deeply over his own broad
shoulders, and covers his satellites and the neigh-
bouring ' ranges in beautiful glistening virginal
white.
The Hotel Kosciusko stands in the midst of
these dazzling snowfields, at an altitude of nearly
6,000 feet. It has been built by the Government
to enable residents of the continent and travellers
from abroad to sojourn in comfort amid the
unparalleled beauties and attractions of this remark-
able region. The hotel is a substantial two-storied
edifice of granite and wood, quite modern, and
up-to-date in every respect. It has spacious
rooms, and is heated throughout by a service of
steam-pipes. Its appointments are quite thorough
and of the latest type, hot and cold water being
laid on throughout the building, and all arrange-
ments possible have been provided for the con-
venience of guests.


START OF LADIES’ TOBOGGAN RACE KOSCIUSKO SNOW CARNIVAL.
The visitor to this hotel in winter may walk out
of the front door on to the snow or ice, and on
skate, ski, or toboggan, enjoy exactly the same
glorious sensations which now annually fill Davos
Platz, St. Moritz, Adelboden, Montreux, and
other famous Swiss resorts, with the fashion and
beauty of Europe.
The tobogganing and ski-running courses are
immediately behind the hotel, so no inconvenience
will be experienced in reaching them. Special
care was taken in laying out these courses, and
they will be found to provide excellent sport. The
longer of the two has a stretch of about 500 yards,
with an average grade of one in three, and a final
steep descent into a broad level expanse —the
ideal course.
It is claimed for ski-running that it is the highest
advantage that any physical exercise can safely
derive from terrestrial attraction, and the practised
snow-shoer who has tried other sports will readily
admit this. Free wheeling down a mountain on a
bolting bicycle is exciting, motoring at a hundred
miles an hour along a level road has its own
peculiar sensations, ballooning is by no means
tame, and riding on the front of a flying express
locomotive makes the wind roar in your ears,
and puts a tingle in your blood, but ski-running


- n>ssn>>^^
A STUDY IN ATTITUDES, KOSCIUSKO SNOW CARNIVAL.
over a snowbank that drops away at the rate of
a foot in two and a half is far before the best of
them. On your own skill and nerve depends
entirely the safety of your passage. At a terrific
pace you must steer, pick out your line of descent,
allow for the different conditions of snow, dodge
inequalities, and preserve a splendid balance at
odd angles as the hill drops suddenly, and perhaps
unexpectedly.
The novice need not attempt at first to shoot
the steeper slopes, but he may derive pleasure
in running down the gentler grades, and feeling a
sense of keen delight and interest in increasing
proficiency. Pleasant ski-running parties may be
arranged of ladies and children for rambles
among the beauties of the snowscapes among the
hills and dales.
Another branch of the snow sport which affords
infinite enjoyment is tobogganing. The tempera-
tures at Kosciusko are not low enough to give
the iced surface to the snow, except in the very
early morning, or the evening, and, consequently,
steel runners may not be used with advantage.
But in spite of this there is a splendid field for
open tobogganing on the Canadian type which
may, perhaps, be best described as three or four
ski bracketed together. On a toboggan of this
style our softer snow may be negotiated at a
great speed. The toboggan, when used off a
banked track, is ridden by one person lying prone,
steering with the toe at the back.
Then there is the ice-skating. No description

nor eulogy is needed to recommend this sport. It
is enough to say that a dam thrown across the
neck of a pleasant gully has imprisoned the waters
of Diggers Creek, making an inviting lakelet
some acres in extent immediately below the Hotel
Kosciusko. Cutting figures in the keen, crisp,
exhilarating air of the Alps beneath the snow-
capped hills, is a pastime pleasant enough to, m
itself, more than recompense anyone for the
trouble of the journey from the metropolis.
The snow-clad landscapes, which a winter trip
to Kosciusko unfolds, are most beautiful, full of
interest and delightful fascination, and an experi-
ence quite new to most Australians.
The English snowscape is beautiful, but the
Australian bush, with its evergreen trees laden
heavily with snow, every leaf bearing its burden
bravely, is an even more wonderful sight. And
the glory of the little furze bushes, with 1 hen-
leafy tendrils loaded and crystallised, bending
down into the snow in graceful curves, or the
fallen giants of the forest piled up with snow, is
something to quicken the pulse and fire the

imagination. The idea of cold so greatly feared
by those unfamiliar with snow country, is largely
a bogy. This idea is as fallacious as the general
belief in it is widespread. One practically never
feels cold in the snow. During the day the
temperature is rarely very low, and even when
the mercury is several degrees below freezing
point the air is so dry and invigorating that not
the slightest inconvenience is felt so long as one
keeps moving, and in the evening when one comes
indoors the artificially heated Hotel provides
perfect comfort.
