“Now unto Him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to
set you before the presence of His glory in exceeding joy, to the only
God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty,
dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore.
Amen.” —St. Jude 24, 25 (Revised Version).
YOU will notice, brethren, on comparing the
Authorised Version of this passage with
the Revised Version, that several alterations have
been made by the Revisers. But there are only
two which strike me as being of much importance.
The one is that instead of the word “falling” we
have the word “ stumbling.” There can be no doubt
that the latter word is the more correct. Those
who wish to satisfy themselves of this may refer to
Romans xi. 11, where the question is asked “ Have
they stumbled that they should fall ? ” Here is a
clear distinction between stumbling and falling, and
the word rendered “stumbled ” is the same as that
which is translated “ falling ” in the Authorised
Version of my text.
The other important alteration made by the
Revisers is that after the word “Saviour” they
have introduced the clause “through Jesus Christ
our Lord.” If this clause be rightly inserted, it
proves that the ascription of the text is addressed to


the first Person of the Blessed Trinity, and not to
the second.
The doxology at the close of an Epistle is
designed to produce the same result as a
preacher’s words to his flock at the close of his
ministry—namely, to leave on the mind an abiding
impression which may raise the affections heaven-
wards, 'strengthen holy purposes, and encourage the
soul in its pursuit of eternal joys.
The doxologies in the Epistles are numerous, and
they form an instructive study. The one which I
have chosen as my text for this to me most solemn
occasion suggests to my mind thoughts which I
would fain leave with you, my dear brethren, now
that my ten years’ ministry among you is, in the
Providence of God, about to terminate. It shall be
my theme this morning.
The doxology celebrates the power of God to
keep and to glorify His people. Let us consider
these two points.
I. “ Now unto Him that is able to keep you from
stumbling.” The writer describes in clear terms the
Christian character of the persons to whom his letter
is addressed : “To them that are sanctified by God
the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and
called.” But no man is to be trusted to keep him-
self, however holy he may be : “by reason of
the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand
upright.” Whatever safeguards may surround us,


arising from education, or position in society, or
natural strength of mind, they fail in the hour
of temptation. The heart of man is deceitful;
it cannot be trusted. You are at any moment
liable to fall into some specious snare; or you
may by degrees become the victim of some easily
besetting sin.
Ministers of Christ cannot keep those committed
to their spiritual care from stumbling. They may
watch for their souls, and administer warning, re-
proof, exhortation, as occasion requires ; it is, indeed,
their bounden duty to do this. But from the nature
of the case their influence is limited. How little do
they know of the hearts of their hearers, or of the
subtle power of the temptations which may be
assailing them, or of the peculiar difficulties which
beset their path. Hence, my text ascribes “glory
and majesty, dominion and power,” “unto Him that
is able to keep” His people. He loves them with
an everlasting love; He pledges Himself to be
faithful to His promises with respect to them. His
love prompts Him, His promise binds Him, His
infinite power enables Him, to keep His people
from stumbling, to hold them up, to strengthen them
in the conflict with sin, the world, the flesh, and the
devil. He can give them that spiritual watchfulness
by which they may discern the pitfalls that lie on
either hand. He can give them such a practical
and experimental knowledge of His will and word,


that they may be preserved from error in doctrine,
and not be carried away by the many false philo-
sophies and plausible heresies which abound in this
restless and adventurous age. The words of the
text show you where your strength lies ; if you keep
near to Him, if you seek communion with Him in
His public ordinances, in partaking of the Lord’s
Supper, in the study of His Word, in secret prayer
and meditation, if you cherish the recollection of
His presence throughout the day—His almighty
power will keep you from stumbling. You cannot
trust Him too absolutely ; you cannot lean too hard
upon Him,
While these considerations will afford you strong
encouragement in your Christian life, they are an
unspeakable comfort to me, as your minister, in the
saddening thought that it will soon be no longer my
privilege to speak to you from this hallowed place.
I may, and I do, commend you in faith and prayer
and hope “to Him that is able to keep.” Able and
eminent men have gone before me in this charge,
and others will follow. But every man who has
been moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon him
this office and ministry has his own message to
deliver—a message which he only can give ; and,
as his ministry becomes known, he will probably
have in his stated congregation, if he labours in
a large city like this, two classes of persons. The
one will consist of those who attend his ministry


because it is carried on in their parish church. This
is a sound, constitutional reason for attending it; if
you are a Churchman, and any one asks you why
you attend such a church, it is quite enough to say
in reply, “It is my parish church.” And I have
always rejoiced to know that many worshippers at
St. George’s attend it on this principle. But there
will be another class of persons, who, whether
parishioners or otherwise, attend a particular ministry
chiefly because he who exercises it has received from
God a message for them, a message suited to their
mental condition, their circumstances, their diffi-
culties, at the time. There was once a servant of
Christ who could say at the close of his ministry in
a certain place, “ I have not shunned to declare
unto you all the counsel of God.” But probably
none but an inspired Apostle would be justified in
thus speaking of his ministry. Divine truth is a
vast circle, so ample in its sweep that a finite mind
can grasp a segment of it here and there, but not
the whole. Our knowledge of truth is fragmentary :
“ now we know in part.” It is not given to any one
man, nor even to any one section of the Church, to
discern truth in its entirety, nor to assign to each
particular truth its just proportions in relation to
other truths. But a man will naturally attach im-
portance to a ministry which God has been pleased
to employ in order to impress upon him, or to make
clear to his mind, such parts of the Gospel as he


most needed to understand ; and when that ministry
is removed, he will naturally feel the loss of it. But
he must not think that his Father in heaven will
allow his spiritual life to suffer through the removal
of any teacher; rather let him believe that the same
wise God who provided him with an instrumentality
which has been of service to him in the past is
now about to bless him, and carry on the work of
grace within him, by other means and through other
channels. The removal of religious teachers is one
of the means used by God to remind His people
that “neither is he that planteth anything, nor he
that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.”
It was indeed the Apostles who distributed the five
loaves to the hungry multitudes in the wilderness;
but in whose hands were they multiplied ? In the
hands of the Lord of life Himself. God removes
His workmen, but He carries on His work, and
proves Himself able to keep His people from
stumbling.
11. But my text, having affirmed God’s power to
keep His people, declares His power to bring them
to everlasting glory. His power is exerted not only
to uphold them in the race, but to secure to them
the prize; not only to protect and guide them
during their wilderness journey, but to conduct them
into the land flowing with milk and honey. This
doxology ascribes to God the power to “present
them faultless before the presence of His glory with
exceeding joy.” What is this glory? When Moses


even, the man whom God knew face to face, prayed,
“ I beseech Thee, show me Thy glory,” the answer
was, “ Thou canst not see My face, for there shall
no man see Me, and live.” Comparing this passage
with others, we come to the conclusion that it is the
Lord Jesus Christ to whom reference is here made.
He is the brightness of His Father’s glory. St.
John, recalling the transfiguration of his Lord, says,
“We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-
begotten of the Father and St. Peter, referring to
the same event, declares that our Lord did on that
occasion receive “from God the Father, honour and
glory.” Again, our Lord in His intercessory prayer,
recorded in the seventeenth chapter of St. John,
expresses His will that His people may be with
Him where He is, that they may behold His glory
which the Father hath given Him. These and
other passages which might be cited lead me to
believe that it is the glory of the Son of God in the
presence of which God the Father is able to present
His people faultless with exceeding joy. The love,
the faithfulness, the power of God are all pledged
to bring about this grand issue. If you are a true
child of God, the circumstances of your life, and the
dispensations and dealings of God with you, are all
tending towards this result. They are often mys-
terious and inscrutable ; nor can we wonder at this
when we consider the narrow bounds of our own
finite minds, as contrasted with the mind of God.
We must needs exclaim, “ O the depth of the riches


both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past
finding out! ” But this ignorance may be endured
for the little while with humble submission if we
are acquainted with the blessed design of God’s
counsels. The traveller may well be reconciled to
the strange turns and windings of the road along
which he passes if he is assured that every step is
bringing him nearer to a palace of delights. And
this is the happy condition of every faithful follower
of Christ. God is keeping his feet, preserving him
from stumbling, directing his way, in order that He
may present him faultless before the presence of
His glory with exceeding joy on the day of the
great Epiphany for which the whole creation yearns
—the day on which the Son of Man shall appear,
“ coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory,” to be crowned in the presence of
assembled worlds with those many crowns which
shall proclaim Him “King of kings and Lord of
lords.”
This coronation day will also be a presentation
day. There will be a Court held. The persons
presented to the King will be such as are indicated
in ver. i, “sanctified by God the Father, and pre-
served in J esus Christ, and called.” Here, indeed, on
earth, this work of sanctification is not perfected. It
is impeded by temptation ; by continual warfare with
the world, the flesh, and the devil; by being in the
body. But on the day of which my text speaks, the


Church will be presented to her Lord “a glorious
Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing, but holy and without blemish,” as a bride
adorned for her husband. Those who are presented
at the Court of an earthly Sovereign make elaborate
preparations for the august ceremony, and are often
heard to contrast the length of preparation with the
brevity of the interview ; the presentee basks in the
sunshine of the royal countenance for a few moments
and then disappears. But the glorious King on the
day which is coming will invite His good and faithful
servants to enter into His joy. And that invitation
will be the beginning of a fulness of joy and plea-
sures for evermore ; for thus it is written, “So shall
we ever be with the Lord,”
So heavy are the responsibilities of Christ’s min-
isters, so serious the consequences of neglect, so
condign the punishment awaiting them if unfaithful,
that should they be permitted to share the glories of
that great day, they may well regard it as an act
of special mercy. It is to be noted that, whereas
St. Paul’s salutation to the churches to whom he
addressed his Epistles, consists of two words,
“ Grace and peace,” in his pastoral Epistles it con-
sists of three, “ Grace, mercy , and peace,” thus im-
plying how urgently the ministers and stewards of
God’s mysteries stand in need of mercy. Is it, then,
within the bounds of possibility that there should
be in store for them any element of joy over
and above that of being themselves admitted into


the King’s presence ? St. Paul, addressing the
Christians of Thessalonica, uses these remarkable
words: “What is our hope, or joy, or crown
of rejoicing ? Are not even ye in the presence
of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming ? ”
Is the indulgence of such an expectation as this
allowed only to an inspired Apostle, or to one who
has founded a Church in the midst of a heathen
community ? Or may an ordinary minister of Christ
indulge such a hope also? His cup of joy would
indeed run over if not only he himself were to be
presented to the King, but also were to be permitted
to witness the presentation of some who through his
ministry had been turned to God, and brought into
the way of life ; this would be exceeding joy ; this
would be “ a crown of glory that fadeth not away.”
While thus speaking of the responsibilities and
hopes of Christ’s ministering servants, I think it will
not be out of place if I read to you a portion of a
letter which I received yesterday from your future
Rector. He writes thus :—“ I have decided to
accept the Lord Chancellor’s offer after much
thought and consultation, but I have also done so
with much anxiety, knowing what heavy respon-
sibilities lam taking upon me. I can only hope
and pray that I may have guidance and strength
given to me sufficient for the duties. And I would
venture to ask you to do what you can to pave the
way for me, by saying a word of exhortation to your
people, asking them to bear with a stranger and


give him that patient consideration of which he will
stand in such need. I know you will do what you
can thus to lighten what I cannot but feel will be a
burden of responsibility and anxiety.”
My dear friends, these words convey to you some
idea of the spirit and frame of mind in which your
future Rector is about to take his place among you ;
and the experience which I myself had ten years
ago assures me that you will give him a Christian
welcome for his Master’s sake, and will uphold and
encourage him by your prayers, your sympathy, and
your help.
I shall conclude by a few remarks upon the para-
mount importance of faith and hope as the springs
of action in the Christian life. It is declared in the
text that God is able to keep His saints from stum-
bling during their journey, and to bestow on them
eternal glory in the life to come. But there is one
state of mind and heart which is represented in
Scripture as crippling even the Divine omnipotence ;
that state is one of unbelief. Concerning Capernaum,
which became our Lord’s own city after His rejection
by the people of Nazareth, it is said that He could
there do no mighty work; and the reason that His
healing power was thus paralysed is added immedi-
ately afterwards : “ He marvelled because of their
unbeliefthis was the fatal obstacle to the putting
forth of His power. It is so still ; the man who has
no faith in the power and love of God to keep him
from stumbling now, and to glorify him hereafter.


must face the consequences of his unbelief; it cuts
off the communication between him and his God.
There is one hand by which we may lay hold on the
power of God; and that hand is faith. To the poor
man who appealed to Christ’s power to heal his
demoniac boy, and seemed for the moment to doubt
that power when he exclaimed, “If Thou canst do
anything,” the Lord replied, “If thou canst —all
things are possible to him that believeth;” and to
the two blind men He said, “Believe ye that I am
able to do this ? ”
If we, then, would realize the manifestation of the
power of God in keeping our feet without slipping as
we pursue our pilgrimage here below, and in pre-
senting us faultless before the presence of His glory
with exceeding joy on the day of His appearing,
away with unbelief; for it is our greatest enemy; it
is the most fatal hindrance to our salvation. Culti-
vate a simple, earnest, childlike confidence in your
heavenly Father’s power ; cast yourselves wholly on
His precious promises, which are firm and un-
changeable as the everlasting hills; and you shall
know, here in part, more fully hereafter, that He is
faithful that calleth you, who also will do it. And
the more you know, the more fervently will your ex-
perience adopt the ascription of praise “to the only
God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both
now and ever. Amen,”


“ Those things which are behind.”— Phil. iii. 13.
WE may regard them in two different lights.
(1) We may regard them as things to be
forgotten, and say, “ The past is gone, and let it go.”
This is the light in which the Apostle views them in
the passage from which the text is taken ; for he
says, “ Forgetting those things which are behind.”
A glance at the context shows that St. Paul is
regarding himself as a runner in the heavenward
race. As it would be fatal to the runner in the
Olympic games to keep looking back, as he must
ever be looking forward to the goal and “reaching
forth ” to it, so must the Christian runner not waste
his time and his energies on unavailing retrospect,
but concentrate his powers on winning the prize set
before him. There is a morbid brooding over past
sins, errors, and failures which enervates the soul,
engenders despondency and unbelief, and incapaci-
tates for moral action. In this sense “those things
which are behind ” should be forgotten.
(2) But there is another sense in which it is very
profitable to remember such things. It is salutary
to do so if the result of the review of the past be
to stir us up to make a more diligent and con-


scientious use of the time still remaining, and if
memory fetches goads from the past to stimulate us
to a deeper repentance and a closer walk with God.
The prodigal son in the parable, as he sat envying
the swine their husks, and recalling regretfully the
old days in his father’s house, where even the hired
servants had bread enough and to spare, was stirred
up by the retrospect to say, “ I will arise, and go
to my father.” When the recollection of the things
which are behind is followed by such a resolution as
this, it must needs be beneficial.
There are special seasons and epochs in the lives
of all of us when the impulse to look back is
stronger than the impulse to look forward. Let
me yield now to the stronger impulse ; it is to me a
solemn moment, the close of my ministry in this
large metropolitan parish.
Among the things which are behind, there are
two which we should never forget —our own sins
and shortcomings, and the wonderful mercy of our
long-suffering God. These two stand out before
me in peculiar prominence as memory busies itself
with the last ten years. It recalls the kindness and
forbearance of my reception when I came among
you as a stranger; the prompt willingness of church-
workers, male and female, to co-operate with me in
good works; and the generous support which I have
received from the “ cheerful giver ” whom “ God
loveth.” It recalls many whom death has sum-


moned, and to whom I was permitted to minister in
their last hours, some of them leaving behind
encouraging evidence that to them to die would
be gain; others, alas! giving no sign. It recalls
happy seasons spent with candidates for confirma-
tion, the joy of seeing some of these holding fast
their Christian profession, regularly frequenting the
Table of the Lord, and showing, by their consis-
tency of conduct and love for the means of grace,
that the baptismal vow was confirmed in spirit and
in truth ; and it recalls the disappointments which
usually attend these solemn seasons—disappoint-
ments caused by those who seemed to run well for a
time, but Satan and the world hindered them ; they
proved like the man in the parable, to whom it was
said, “ Son, go work to-day in my vineyard. And
he answered, I go, sir: and went not.”
Memory recalls, also, the goodness of God in
granting me health and strength for my ministra-
tions ; I do not recollect an instance in which I
have been prevented by sickness, or other Provi-
dential hindrance, from fulfilling my engagements
to preach in this pulpit. God has given me the
great advantage of a regular congregation, especially
at the midday service. Sunday after Sunday have
I been permitted to gaze on the same faces of
persons occupying the same seats, to join with them
in solemn worship, to administer to them the Holy
Communion, and to proclaim to them the Word of


life. And though it is a far greater strain upon the
mind to preach to the same congregation year after
year than to address assemblies of strangers, it is
far more interesting and profitable to the preacher
himself to do the former than to do the latter —at
least, this is my experience. And it has been my
unspeakable happiness from time to time to hear of
those to whom the message delivered has been “ a
word spoken in due season.” When I recall such
things as these, my heart leaps for joy. It is true
that they are things which are now behind, but I
wish never to forget them; I would adopt the
language of the Psalmist, “ Bless the Lord, O my
soul, and forget not all His benefits.”
But the retrospect has another side. Omissions
and shortcomings present themselves to me as I
look back. To dwell upon these before a mixed
congregation would be unwise and unprofitable, but
they occupy too large a place in my thoughts to be
passed over in silence. It is well for me to recall
them, to mourn over them, to repent of them. For
the close of a ministry suggests the same class of
thoughts as may be expected to occupy the mind
when not merely a period of life, but the whole of it,
shall be among the things which are behind. Then
the soul will see behind her the whole season of
probation closed, and the judgment-seat of Christ
before her. It is wise to judge ourselves, that we
be not judged of the Lord. St. Paul did not forget


the past; the recollection of it prompted him to
write those precious words: “It is a faithful saying,
and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
chief.” I do indeed heartily appreciate the many
tokens of your kindness and affection which sur-
round me ; but they do not blind me to the im-
perfections of the service rendered to my Lord.
To compare what He had a right to expect with
what has been rendered to Him is to be covered
with shame and confusion of face.
Now let me turn from the preacher to the hearers.
My brethren, you, too, will have an account to give
of the manner in which you have received the Gospel
which has been preached to you in this place. It is
a time for self-examination; let conscience do its
work to-night. Let it recall seasons of conviction,
as you heard the nature of sin declared, its hateful-
ness in the sight of God pointed out, its terrible
penalty stated, and the only way of escape from it
shown to you. Perhaps, like Felix, you trembled.
But how long did these impressions continue ? Did
they lead to true repentance towards God, to faith
towards our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the pursuit
of that holiness without which no man shall see the
Lord ? Or did you bid all such thoughts go their
way for that time ?
Backsliders, you have been invited to return to
your offended Father, and have been assured that


He will heal your backslidings, and receive you
into the arms of His mercy. If there be any self-
righteous among you, it has been affirmed again and
again that your own righteousness cannot abide the
scrutiny of God’s holy law, and that you must be
clothed with the righteousness of the Lord Jesus if
you would be accepted before God. If there be any
self-indulgent, self-pleasing professors of religion,
you have been warned that Christ rejects offers of
service from those who will not take up their cross
and follow Him. Let each consider whether he has
given heed to the counsels and warnings which he
has received. If not, let this solemn time be chosen
for an act of self-surrender to the service of God.
The hearts of many of you are, I know, affected by
the prospect of losing an old friend and teacher.
My dear friends, let that teacher’s last address to you
prevail on you to yield yourselves to God. Remem-
ber that this has been my desire for you throughout
my ministry—that you should follow my Lord and
Saviour; that, for His sake who gave Himself for
you, you should renounce the world and sin, and
become steadfast, consistent Christians.
We shall soon be parted. The solemnity of this
occasion is increased in my own case by the fact
that the close of my ministry is also the
close of my ministrations as a parochial clergyman.
On two previous occasions I have been called to
address my flock for the last time ; but it was with


the expectation of carrying on parochial work else-
where. Now it is otherwise : the peculiarly tender
tie which unites the parish clergyman to his
parishioners is broken. Henceforth I am to be
employed not as the Rector of a parish, but as
the Bishop of a Diocese; I am to ordain
candidates for holy orders, to administer the rite
of confirmation, and to be the overseer, not of a
single parish, but of a large number of parishes
scattered over an extensive diocese. The things
which are behind must give place to the things
which are before. Brethren, pray for me that the
grace of God may be sufficient for me in the exer-
cise of this new office, and in the discharge of these
untried duties.
But never let us forget that, however busily occu-
pied we may be with the duties of the present, and
with anticipations of the future, “ God requireth that
which is past!' I have heard of a sun-dial which
bore this inscription : “ Pereunt et imputantur ”
they {i.e.y the hours, the days, the months, the years)
perish and are imputed. ' Why dwell upon this ?
We cannot recall them. There may be many here
who would be glad if they could recall certain
periods of life, so as to spend them more wisely ;
but they cannot do it. God knows this; He
knows that tears and regrets cannot bring back
an unprofitable past; and therefore He has
provided for sinners a way of peace. He has


set forth (such is His wondrous mercy) His
own Son Jesus Christ to be a propitiation for
past sin; He has arranged that the blood of that
Son shall purge the conscience of the sinner from
dead works when he puts his whole trust in
his Saviour and Redeemer. We may remember,
and we ought to remember, “ the things which are
behind,” that the recollection may humble us, and
deepen our repentance, and endear to us the atone-
ment of our Saviour; but if we are found under the
shadow of His Cross, the word of God to us is this :
“ I am He that blotteth out thine iniquities and will
not remember thy sins.” What marvellous loving-
kindness is this, my dear brethren ; the news of it
may well cause us to leap for joy. What an inex-
pressible relief it is to a needy, struggling debtor,
whose efforts to meet the creditor’s claims are fruit-
less, when he learns that a third party has come
forward and cancelled the debt. Jesus is that third
party ; but He is so because it was the gracious will
of the Almighty Creditor that He should be so :
“ God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son.” The acceptance of this gospel with
all the heart and soul is followed by peace with God,
and the gift of the Holy Spirit to renew and sanctify
the believer.
My brethren, these are familiar truths; but I
value them more and more; I look to them to
sustain me in the hour of sorrow, to comfort me in


time of sickness and suffering', and to smooth my
dying pillow. It has never been my habit to
preach tentatively, or to occupy your time with
doubtful matters after the manner of one who is
groping his way toward the truth ; but rather to
draw your attention to those plain truths of Scripture
which I could introduce with a “ Thus saith the
Lord.” I urge them once more on your acceptance.
I desire that you should embrace them at once. You
have heard my last sermon, and are expecting to
hear the sermons of others ; but the time will come,
perhaps sooner than you anticipate, when you will
have heard your last sermon. I beseech you that
ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
You that are already the people of God, who
have helped and cheered my labours by your sym-
pathy and prayers and ready help, and that for
the sake of the Master whom we serve, let the
recollection of the things which are behind encour-
age you to trust your heavenly Father with a more
child-like, simple confidence. How good He has
been to you ! He has planted His love in your
hearts; old things have passed away; you have
been made new creatures in Christ Jesus. What
a ground is this for expecting Him to bless
you hereafter ! “ The Lord hath been mindful of
you, He will bless you.” You are about to lose the
ministrations of one who has been so happy as to
win your affectionate regard. But this is no cause


for discouragement. “ Let no man glory in man,”
says the Apostle ; “for all things are yours ; whether
Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
death, or things present, or things to come ; all are
yours ; and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.”
Then the bright word of hope
Shall on our parting gleam,
And tell of joys beyond the scope
Of earth-born dream.
Farewell! in hope and love,
In faith, and peace, and prayer ;
Till He, whose home is ours above,
Unite us there !

“ LORD our God, Who art in every place j from Whom no
space or distance can ever separate us; we know that
those who are absent from each other are still present with Thee,
and we therefore pray Thee to have in Thy Holy keeping those
(dear ones) from whom we now are separated; and grant that both
they and we, by drawing nearer unto Thee, may be drawing nearer
unto each other, bound together by the unseen chain of Thy
love, in the communion of Thy Spirit, and the Holy fellowship
of Thy Saints ; that whether or not, according as seemeth best to
Thy Divine Majesty, we meet together again here on earth, we
may surely meet again at the Resurrection of the Just, and go in
together to that house of many mansions which Thou hast pre-
pared for them that unfeignedly love Thee; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen."
