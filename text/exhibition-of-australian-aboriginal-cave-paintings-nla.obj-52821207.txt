EXHIBITION OF AUSTRALIAN
ABORIGINAL CAVE PAINTINGS
EXHIBITION HALL, AUSTRALIA HOUSE
STRAND. LONDON, W.C.2
to be opened by
The Australian High Commissioner in Great Britain
The Rt. Hon. J. A. BEASLEY
on WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15th, 1947
Exhibition arranged by the Australian News and Information
Bureau, by courtesy of Professor Dr. Jensen, of the University
of Frankfurt, and Dr. K. Hissink, of the Frobenius Institute,
Frankfurt; the Controllers of Fine Arts and Archives Office of
the U.S. Military Government in Hesse; the Australian Military
Mission, Berlin; the Australian Reparations Team in Germany;
and the Australian Scientific and Technical Mission, London.
All these sketches, drawings and copies featuring Australian
Aboriginal life were made by members of an anthropological
research expedition party to North-West Australia in the years
1938 and 1939 —the German Frobenius expedition.
The expedition was conducted by Dr. Helmut Petri. Others
who took part were: Douglas Fox, of New York, Patrick
Pentony, of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, and Dr. Andreas
Lemmel as technical advisers; and Mrs. Agnes Schulz and Mrs.
Gerta Beck-Kleist as artists. The latter three are all members
of the Frobenius Institute at Frankfurt-on-the-Main.
Most of the pictures deal with items and glimpses of
Aboriginal life. In 1938 conditions in the Kimberley country
were almost the same as they were in 1837, when the Camden
Sound and Prince Regent River areas were explored by Sir
George Grey. The description given by Sir George Grey


emphasised that some of the figures had what appeared to Grey
to be haloes round their heads and to be wearing long robes.
See No. 55, where the painting shows a kind of horseshoe
surrounding the figure’s head, said by the natives to represent
sunbeams, and the stripes suggesting a long robe, explained by
the present-day Aborigines as representing a beard, or falling
rain.
Many aspects of the old Stone Age “ blackfellow ” civilisa-
tion can be seen in this collection. Except for some individuals
working on the cattle stations, the Kimberley Aborigines are
“ bush blackfellows ” in the true sense of the word. Like their
forefathers, they depend entirely on hunting, fishing and food-
gathering within limited areas, the “ countries ” of their local
groups. It is a semi-nomadic way of life. The material
possessions of the Kimberley blackfellows are undoubtedly poor.
On the other hand these tribes have the most remarkable cave
paintings in Australia and are particularly skilful in flaking
fine and sharp stone spear-points. This may be regarded as a
highly technical process, only known in the Northern and
Eastern Kimberley districts.
The Australian Aborigine had a highly developed sense of
design and colour. In these respects his best work is comparable
to»that of the Stone Age artists of Europe, although he never
attained to the realistic drawings of these prehistoric Europeans.
In some of the remoter regions of the centre and north of
Australia, Aborigines are still making paintings in the old Stone
Age tradition, but at Hermannsburg, in Central Australia, a
group of seven Aboriginal artists are painting landscapes in the
European style. This group is headed by Albert Namatjira,
who learned to paint while acting as camel-man to the Australian
artist Rex Battarbee.
There are 73 pictures in all in the Australia House Exhibition
—43 drawings of Aborigines, homesteads, and other features of
native life in the Kimberleys, made by the members of the
Frobenius expedition, 22 cave paintings, two bark paintings, and
six prehistoric rock paintings. These fine reproductions brought
back to Europe from the world’s oldest continent make up one
of the most remarkable displays of Stone Age art yet seen in
London.

No. 20. Aboriginal way of flaking spearheads.
Suitable “ soft ” stones (quartzite, sandstone and
other easily flaking stones) are broken down to some-
where near the size of a spearhead. For the actual
flaking a sort of stone anvil with several layers of
paperbark is used, with a pointed stick of hard wood.
The man presses on one edge of the roughly shaped
spearhead and breaks off a flake. Turning the stone,


he continues till the finer shape of the spearhead is
visible. He next takes a sharp kangaroo bone (see
drawing ) and presses flakes away from the edges of
the spearhead till he has the finished shape. The final
stage of work is serrating the edges of the spearhead
with another fine and sharp kangaroo bone. As a
rule the making of one spearhead takes several hours.
In present times very often beer bottles and telegraph
insulators are used instead of stones for flaking spear-
heads. Sale River, N.W. Australia.

SECTION II.
Aboriginal Cave and Bark Paintings.
The remarkable cave paintings of the Central and Northern
Kimberley districts are associated with the blackfellow’s so-called
totemic view of life and the beliefs concerning the increase of
natural (totemic) species. Almost each gallery includes at least
one mythical hero known as “ Wond’ina ” and represented as
a human-like being with nose, eyes and a horseshoe adornment
round his head, but without a mouth.
These Wond’ina are the great ancestors of the Aboriginal’s
mythical past and are linked with the sky, rain, the rainbow-
serpent, spirit children and the increase of natural species.
If the paintings are " touched ” by members of the totemic
territorial clan rain will come in due season, and the rainbow-
serpent’s spirit children, living in billabongs (permanent water-
holes), will be available for incarnation. In the same way if
the men paint or repaint the rock pictures of their totemic
species, the latter are expected to increase.
Each gallery in the Central and Northern Kimberleys is
associated with one distinct Wond’ina hero, who seems to be the
mythical ancestor of the respective local totemic clan and the
representation of unseen life-giving powers.
One of the most important features of the Kimberley
Wond’ina cult is the blackfellows’ belief that the cave paintings
originally have not been made by men. They say that in the
mythical past the Wond’ina heroes left their “ print ” (shadow)
on the rocks before “ they went down ” (in the ground) and
changed to rainbow-serpents (Ungud).
No. 44. Cave Painting.

No. 5J. Cave painting in natural size.
The main figure represents a Wond’ina (mythical hero
and symbol of creative powers) in a lying position.
The two beings painted on his body are said to be
his sons, sent up by him to the sky in order to make
the rain fall. According to another story they are two
spirit children. ’ If repainted spirit children will be
available for reincarnation. Over the horseshoe
adornment of the main Wond’ina’s head a representa-
tion of lightning is to be seen. The other paintings of
the cave are smaller, less important Wond’ina-beings
and the paintings of the totems of the Modum local
clan (yams, lily roots and a diver duck). The
colouring matter used is red and yellow ochre, white
pipeclay and charcoal. Modum, Walcott Inlet,
Ungarinyin tribe, N.W. Australia.

No. 55. Cave painting.
Unusual portrayal of a Wond’ina hero in red and
yellow ochre, natural size. The lines surrounding the
figure’s head are said to be sunbeams. The body
stripes, running down from the chin to the feet, give
the impression of a long robe; according to the black-
fellows’ information, however, they represent the
Wond’ina’s beard or falling rain. Bind'ibi, Calder
River District, Walcott Inlet, N.W. Australia.
G. KLEIST.
No. 56. Cave painting.
Group of Wond’ina heads and a sacred night bird,
freshly repainted in red, white and black. The
irregular lines and dotted circles on the right side of
the cave painting explained as “ bush tucker,”
probably edible roots. The indefinite long-shaped
paintings, filled in with dots, are supposed to be
representations of lightning. Bind’ibi, Calder River
District, Walcott Inlet, Ungarinyin tribe, N.W.
Australia.

Painting of “ Kaluru,” the so-called “ lightning
man,” one of the most important beings of the black-
fellow’s mythical traditions. The colours are dark
red ochre and white pipeclay. The small circles on
the right side of the picture are supposed to be black
plums, a wild fruit. The “ lightning man,” as a
legendary hero of the Ungarinyin tribe, is believed
to be responsible for rain, thunderstorms, fertility and
the welfare of the tribe. Kalurungari, Calder River
District, Walcott Inlet, N.W. Australia,
A. S. SCHULZ.

Between three usual Wond’ina heads, freshly re-
painted, the portrayals of three flying foxes, the main
totems of the Koralyi local clan. Above, a strangely
shaped human figure in a lying position, explained as
a female Wond’ina being. The arrangement of the
body stripes is rather unusual for the Australian
North-West. On the left side of the painting are a
representation of lightning and parts of the head
adornment of another Wond’ina being. The latter is
the Koralyi-Wond’ina, the main painting of the
gallery. Koralyi, Calder River District, Walcott
Inlet, Ungarinyin tribe, N.W. Australia.

No. 64. Cave painting.
Painting of two rainbow-serpents who are said to be
incarnations of two mythical female beings, the wives
of the “ Kalingi-Ungud,” named Waiangari and
Lilingo. According to the legendary tradition of the
Aboriginals they came in the mythical past from the
Unambal country on the other side of the Prince
Regent River, and the small figures surrounding them
are spiritual beings they brought along. The yellow
dots on their bodies are explained as the serpents’
eggs. Kalingi, Walcott Inlet, Ungarinyin tribe.
A. S. SCHULZ.
No. 65. Cave painting.
In the centre of the painting are the head and bust
of a Wond’ina being in a lying position. .The bow
round his head, painted in yellow-reddish ochre,
explained as lightning or rainbow. The small human
figure on the left side was called by the Aboriginals
the little son of Wond’ina and cultural hero of the
place. The long-shaped figures on the left side are
yams, one of the Kalingi totemic species. The two
snake-like representations above the central Wond’ina
painting are of unknown significance. Kalingi,
Walcott Inlet, Ungarinyin tribe, N.W. Australia.
A. S. SCHULZ.
No. 66. Cave painting.
Roughly shaped Wond’ina painting and representa-
tions of wallabies. Kobudda, Walcott Inlet, Ungarin-
yin tribe.
A. S. SCHULZ.
No. 67. Cave painting.
Painting of the hero of the rising sun in white pipeclay,
yellow ochre and charcoal. This portrayal of a
mythical being seems to be particularly remarkable on
account of its unusual form. It cannot be compared
with any other of the conventionalized Wond’ina
paintings of the Kimberleys. Bradwodingari, Mount
Agnes, N.W. Australia.

SECTION III.
Prehistoric Rock Paintings.
The so-called prehistoric rock paintings of the Kimberley
district have no meaning for the living blackfellow and probably
belong to now extinct Aboriginal civilisations. They represent
a totally different character from the Wond’ina paintings which
play an important part in native cultures.
The figures, nearly all painted in red ochre, have often been
endowed with a great sense of reality and animation. They
represent long-shaped human beings wearing tassels and various
ornaments on hair, neck, waist, arms and legs. Evidently they
are a much greater mystery than the paintings of the famous
Wond’ina galleries.
These prehistoric rock pictures are marked by many features
which distinguish them from all other known specimens of
Australian Aboriginal art.
Paintings of a similar type were found in 1892 by Mr. J.
Bradshaw on the Upper Prince Regent River.
No. 68. Prehistoric rock painting.
Woman suckling a baby. On the left side probably
representation of a child carrying a bark bucket.
