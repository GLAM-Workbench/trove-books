CAPTAIN COOK IN NEW SOUTH WALES
This being the age of criticism, and not the time of
taking for granted as a fact whatever one had heard from
book or speech, an investigation of the story of Cook?s
Discovery of New South Wales may neither be unwelcome
nor unexpected.
The story must have been deemed of consequence, when
the Admiralty was willing to pay Dr. Hawkesworth six
thousand guineas, or pounds, as reported, to write the
account of that voyage in H.M.S. Endeavour.
Though even after its appearance some doubts were
expressed as to its propriety, or even veracity, yet some
allowance was made for professional jealousies, as well as
for the paucity of information upon Australian matters,
and the want of means either to substantiate or reject the
assertions of the writer.
Objection was taken to the literary mode adopted. The
author chose to make the narrative in the form of a
personal record of events. The Captain was represented
as speaking of himself, saying, ? I saw,? or ? I did,? &c. It
was asserted by critics that to accomplish this personal
mode of narration, there would necessarily arise some
difficulties in the rearrangement of his sources of history.
Was there not a little temptation in the adoption of that
plan to alter, repress, or exaggerate facts, or even to invent
trivial matters for accommodation ?


The book had a wonderful sale, and no great amount of
hostile remarks. Dr. Hawkesworth?s death, so soon after
the publication, disarmed those ready to question. Cook?s
fellow-voyagers, Banks, Matra, and the officers of the
Endeavour , were either silent, absent, or unqualified to
speak. Thoughtful men did inquire into the sources of
the writer?s information, their extent, and authenticity.
The singular dispersion, loss, or destruction of such
sources were fresh causes of embarrassment. Mr., after-
wards Sir Joseph, Banks, is said to have declared that he
furnished no assistance to the Editor.
Here it may be at once announced that this inquiry into
the published Voyage of the Endeavour through the pen of
Dr. Hawkesworth, has little to do with Cook as a man and
a navigator. The story was written by a literary man,
commanded or selected, and the Grand Old Sailor who
has for so long a time engrossed the affectionate interest
and respectful regard of all Australians, as the discoverer,
or, if you will, the re-discoverer of the eastern side of New
Holland, will not suffer in our esteem by the criticism of a
book about the voyage.
Though that side happened to be that chosen for the
New South Wales early settlement, yet the people of
South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, New
Zealand, and Tasmania, with its emigrating offspring of
Port Phillip?now Victoria?lands first seen by Hollanders
a century or more before Cook was born, have the like
reverence as those of Sydney for the indirect cause of
British extension in those Southern Colonies.
Canada is as indebted to the scientific pilot of the St.
Lawrence for the addition of its western woodlands to the
British Empire, as the continent and islands of Australia
may be to the Yorkshire mariner on the Pacific, for their
occupation by our countrymen under the Crown.
No one who reads with pleasure the Voyage of the
Resolution , about which no doubts ever existed, will think
the less of James Cook, because the narrative of the


Endeavour had the misfortune to be prepared, in his
absence, by a less capable historian. As the worthy
Captain always candidly acknowledged his inability, from
defective education, and from absorption in seamanlike
pursuits from his early boyhood, to tell his own tale, we
naturally wonder how Dr Hawkesworth compiled the
adventurous voyage of the Endeavour.
The natural answer would be the Logs and Journals of
the voyagers. Cook himself wrote very little, but there are
now in existence several Journals attributed to him, or
written under his direction. Those in the so-called Queen's
Log, the Admiralty Log, the British Museum Log
(presented by Banks), and that one in the possession of
the Hudson family at Sunderland. There is, also, in the
British Museum one Aiitograph Log whose records
included the Australian portion of the voyage, in Cook's
handwriting , and the only one extant which we expect can
claim to be written by himself. Others are reported copies,
by ships? clerks, sent home from Java.
What great differences may be observed even in these
Logs? or, in what way does the official ?Cook?s Voyage?
differ from any of them ?
The most important points are those affecting the names
of Botany Bay and New South Wales, with the
language used in taking possessio7i of the new Territory.
We have next to consider whether there are Logs
remaining which were compiled by officers of the ship
Endeavour.
A few years ago, behind some old wainscotting in the
Deptford Government Victualling Yard, were discovered
several Logs of the interesting ship, which are now safely
preserved in the admirably conducted Public Record Office,
Chancery Lane.
Do these veritable Logs and Journals throw any light
upon the disputed questions respecting Botany Bay and
New South Wales ? The plain unvarnished tale of seamen,
though oftentimes copied from each other, yet evidently


written down at the period of the occurrence of events, may
be set against the much varied accounts attributed to
Cook himself, and in copies recorded to have been sent
home from Java, where so many of the crew were sick.
But these copies were, apparently, made by the same
transcribers, and done upon the same plan. There were
blank spaces left for the day and date , with other spaces for
the after insertion of the locality visited. It is not a little
singular that our navigator should allow these Logs to be
sent forth in so incomplete a state. It is not to be
wondered that, if en route , or upon arrival in England,
such copies should have these spaces more or less filled up,
according to order, or to the fancy of the copyist.
We are thus prepared for the remarkable aspect of one
called after its salesman, Mr. Corner, and now in Sydney?s
custody.
I had three opportunities, as a supposed expert, of
examining that Log. I pointed out, in a personal inter-
view with a distinguished Admiralty authority, my
reasons for doubt as to its authenticity as a genuine
Cook.
Corner?s Log has side references in a hand differing
from that in the text. The days named are clearly written
by another party, and in red ink. The first copyist never
ventured to name place or date, but left the open spaces to
be filled by another. This Log names both Point Hicks
and Cape Howe , unknown in earlier copies of the voyage
chronicles.
There is some reason to think that Corner?s document
may have served as one of the authorities with Dr.
Hawkesworth. Thus, it records ? the bay which I called
Edgecombe Bay,? while the published work says ? the bay
I called Edgecombe Bay.? Corner has it, of a native
woman, ? had nothing to cover her nudities ? ; but the
author states ? both were stark naked.? In cases, the
penknife was used : as, Iron Head was altered to Cape
Cleveland , and both Rockingham and Halifax Bays were


afterthoughts, judging from the former erasures being
unsuccessfully performed.
The Logs of the Endeavour could not have troubled the
authors of ?Cook?s Voyage? over much, discrepancies
appearing so often between them (the supposed medium
of information) and the printed volume ; so much absurd
or such unnecessary matters being introduced, with so large
an extent of imagination employed.
These supposed Journalistic sources being frequently
absent, the Doctor was treated by some as a mere romancer.
It is singular that, while the assertion was repeated that he
regulated his descriptions by the Journals, nothing is ever
said as to what became of them, and the very names of the
writers are not mentioned. Dalrymple, the great naval
historian, declared at the first that Dr. Hawkesworth had
not collated all the Journals, ? as these indubitably prove ? ;
adding, ? there are many Journals he never once looked
into.? Dalrymple evidently knew something of them, and
challenged Hawkesworth to give a list of the Journals he
had incorporated.
The simple fact that the Doctor dwells so much upon
Botany Bay and New South Wales , places never mentioned
by the great majority of Logs in our present possession,
shows singular carelessness, or a doggedness in maintaining
a personal conviction wanting confirmation. The Monthly
Review of August, 1773, admits the confusion of a com-
posite style in having each Commander telling his own
story, with the Doctor?s reflections being intermixed, so
that the result is a medley of seaman and philosopher,
employing indiscriminately the ? language of the Log book
and the Portico .?
COOK'S LOGS.
These are of two ages, determined by their contents.
Those which introduce Stingray Bay instead of Botany
Bay , and which mention neither New South Wales nor


New Wales pertain to the primitive order, executed while
on the voyage, like the logs of the Lieutenant, the Gunner,
the Boatswain, the Master?s-Mate, &c.
Of this class there are two in the British Museum, one
of which (a copy) was presented there by Cook?s friend,
Sir Joseph Banks, and the other, containing only a portion
of the voyage, written in Cook?s own hand as seen in his
own official letters. Outside the Museum only one Log
can be identified as genuine ; being, though a copy, signed
by Cook, and declared to be a present from the Captain
himself to his friend and patron, Sir Hugh Palliser, and
ever since remaining in the custody of the Palliser family.
These three Logs know nothing of New South Wales
nor Botany Bay.
Several other Logs, purporting to have been sent home
later by the Captain, have filled up spaces with the names
of New South J Vales, Port Jackson, and Bota7iy Bay, all
unknown to Captain Cook or Lieutenant Hickes,
It does not yet appear that Dr. Hawkesworth, Editor of
the Voyage of the Endeavour, had access to any original
Cook?s Log or Journal. Sir Joseph Banks is said to have
repudiated supplying the Doctor with any material. Cook
and his Lieutenant were absent on another voyage, nor
does any other person connected with the voyage, as Dr.
Solander and James Matra, appear to have communicated
information. The Editor was perforce driven to make use
of other and less reliable sources for his story, framed, as
it was, on the model of a personal narrative?the Adven-
tures of Captain Cook.
That Journal of Cook s presented by Sir Joseph Banks,
and still to be examined by a visitor at the Museum, is
numbered among the ? Additional Manuscripts ? as Bpjp.
It is well bound, bearing at the back the words Mus. Brit.
ex legato Banks, Bart. ? Bpyp. The priceless copy in
Cook?s own hand, well written, if not always correctly
spelled, is numbered 27,88s in the Museum Catalogue, and
contains on a fly-sheet at the beginning the statement


that the Log was purchased of Messrs, Borne on 13th of
May, 1868.
Cook?s own Journal is known generally as the Autograph,
from bearing his correct signature. The transcriber of the
Endeavour Log , 8959, possessed by Banks, wrote in a neat
but rather small hand, very different from Cook?s. It is,
as might be well expected of such an early Journal,
though passing through Banks?s hands, ignorant of the
existence of a Botany Bay , but refers to Skeats rather than
Stingray , after which Cook?s Autograph Log names the
Bay. It has neither Point Hickes nor Cape Howe as in later
days, though indicating Pidgeon's House Hill and Mount
Dromedary. Yet we have smoaks and smooks as in Cook?s
own hand work.
THE PALLISER LOG.
The PALLISER LOG, presented by Cook himself to his
old American Commander and patron, Admiral Sir Hugh
Palliser, was examined by me in Sunderland, when invited
there by its owner for some days, Mr. R. W. Hudson, the
northern shipowner. His lady, a Palliser, assured me the
book had never been out of the possession of the family
since Cook?s gift.
I read therein :
? This Book was a Present from Captain Cook to Sir
Hugh Palliser, containing his Logg from the 27th May,
1768, to the nth June, 1771, during his voyage on board
the Endeavour Bark, sent to make observations on the
Transit of Venus in the South Seas, and afterwards to
make discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere.?
The book was bound in red morocco, gold bordered, with
a fancy back, and marked :
?Cook?s Logo Book, 1768, 1769, 1770, 1771.?
Though not, as I saw at once, wholly in Cook?s hand-
writing, the record had no knowledge either of Botany Bay
or of New South Wales , but had the Cook?s style of spelling,
as : ? severed smokes were seen,? and ? saw smokes upon


the shore.? What was afterwards known as Botany Bay
is there called ? Sting Ray Harbour
Apart from the Museum Logs, this one is undoubtedly
the best authenticated Cook's Log.
THE DEPTFORD LOGS.
Among the profound Endeavour mysteries must be cited
the extraordinary disappearance of the Log books of officers
in the ship.
It was according to naval rule that any so compiled
should, at the expiration of the voyage, be deposited with
the naval authorities. After a hundred years or so a
number of Endeavour Logs were discovered behind some
wainscotting at the Deptford Victualling Yard. They were
safely conveyed to the good custody of the officers of the
London Record Office, Chancery Lane. They could not
have been seen by Dr. Hawkesworth any more than those
of Cook himself.
The one by Lieutenant Hickes was kept from May 27,
1768, to March 14, 1771. Third Lieutenant Gore became
Second Lieutenant March 26, 1770. Bootie?s Log was from
May 17, 1768, to September 3, 1770; Forward?s, May 17,
1768, to September 26, 1770; Green, astronomer, September
24, 1763, to October 3, 1770; C. Clerke?s, August 26, 1768,
to October 3, 1770; Wilkinson?s, June 22, 1768, to August
3, 1770; Pickersgill?s, June 10, 1768, to September 29,
1770; Lieutenant Gore?s from July 3, 1768, to December
7, 1769. An unsigned Log was from May 27, 1768, to
September 28, 1770; a second from August 26, 1768, to
July 15, 1769; a third, May 27, 1768, to September 28,
1770; and a fourth from May 27, 1768, to January 9, 1770.
George Nowell was Carpenter; Samuel Evans,Boatswain.
The Quarter-master Thierman, and Widowson came from
New York. James Magra, afterwards Matra, of New
York, volunteered as seaman, but rose to be Midshipman,
and the special friend, through many years, of Sir Joesph


Banks, whose correspondence is in the Museum. Not one of
the Deptford Logs knows Botany Bay or New South Wales.
How came these seamen?s Logs hidden ? Why was their
testimony not to be forthcoming in the book ? Had the
discovery of the Dauphin Map, 154 2 > put Stingray Bay
out of court, and induced the Editor, not Banks, nor Cook,
to revive the ancient name of Baie des Plantes ? Did
Banks and Solander object to the removal of Cook?s name ?
or were other and higher influences at work to conceal
the Deptford Logs, so that all might hear only Botany Bay
and New South Wales ? But the Record Office has the
Deptford hidden Logs, that came to tell another tale than
that of the official publication.
BOTANY BAY.
LOG REFERENCES.
The Cook?s Museum Autograph Log , 27,885, has this
version of the visit to the Bay :
?Sunday, April 29, 1770. ?Gentle breezes and settled
weather. At 3 p.m. anchored in 7 fathom water in a place
which I call?d Sting-Ray Harbour, the South point bore
S.E.,andthe Northpoint East distant from the south shore
1 mile. We saw several of the natives on both sides of
the Harbour as we came in, and a few hutts, women, and
children on the north shore opposite to the place where
we anchor?d, and where I soon after landed with a party
of men, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and
Tupia?as we approached the shore the natives all made
off except two men, who at first seem?d resolved to oppose
our landing. We endeavour?d to gain their consent to
land by throwing them some nails, beeds, &c., ashore, but
this had not the desired effect, for as put into the shore
one of them threw a large stone at us, and as soon as we
landed they threw 2 darts at us, but the firing of two or
three musquets loaded with small shott they took to the
woods, and we saw them no more. We found here a few
poor Hutts, made of the Bark of trees, in one of which were
hid 4 or 5 Children, with whom we left some strings of
Beeds, &c. After searching for fresh water without success
except a little in a small hole ?dug in the sand?we em-
barqued and went over to the north point of the Bay, where
in coming in we saw several of the natives?but when we


now landed we saw nobody, but we here found some fresh
water, which came trinkling down and stood in Pools
among the rocks, but as this was troublesome to get at
I sent a party of men ashore in the morning abreast of the
Ship to dig holes in the Sand, by which means we found
fresh water, sufficient to water the Ship. After breakfast I
sent some empty casks ashore to fill, and a party of men
to cut Wood, and went myself in the Pinnace to sound
and explore the Bay, in the doing of which I saw several
of the natives, who all fled at my approach.?
In reference to the name of BOTANY Bay, Cook?s Auto-
graph Log , numbered 27,885, Additional Manuscripts,
British Museum, must have the first place. There we
read :
? Remarks on May the 6th, 1770.? ? Pleasent weather.
People emp d wooding,? &c.
Afterwards came the Bay news, thus :
?The Yawl return?d from fishing, having caught two
Sting rays, whose weight was near 600 lbs. The great
quantity of these sort of fish found in the place occasioned
my giving it the name of Sting-Ray Harbour. Light airs
and fair weather.?
The Endeavour or Banks?s Log, 8,959 of Museum, under
date May 6, simply remarks: ? Caught two Skeat whose
weight was near 600 lbs.? ; but the ship left without naming
the Stingray or Skeat Bay in this log.
The PALLISER Log, a direct present from Captain Cook to
his old patron, Sir Hugh Palliser, and ever since preserved
in the family, though not positively in Cook?s handwriting,
is signed by him, and must be ever considered of the
highest authority. It knows nothing of Botany Bay.
Extracts from the Palliser Log.
Remarks, &c., in Stingray Harbour: ?

sides of the Harbour as we came in, and a few Hutts,
women, and children, on the North Shore opposite the

with a party of men, Accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr.

put in to the shore, one of them threw a Large stone at us

Fireing of 2 or 3 musquets loaded with small shott they
took to the woods and we saw them no more. We found
here a few Old hutts made of the Bark of Trees in one of
which were hid 4 or 5 children with whom we left
some strings of beeds &c a . After searching for fresh water,
without Success Except a little in a small hole dug in the

? The Yawl returnd from fishing having Caught 2 Sting-
rays the weight of which was near 600 lb. The great
quantity of these sort of fish found here. Occasioned my
giving it the Name of Stingray Harbour .?
THE LIEUTENANT?S LOG AND STING REA BAY
The most reliable opinion as to matters connected with
a voyage may be expected from the first mate or chief
officer of a vessel. Lieutenant Zackary Hickes, whose log
of the ship Endeavour was recovered a few years ago, gives
his ? Remarks on board his Majesty?s Barque Endeavour
New Holland, 1770.? Therein we read for successive
days:
? Moor?d in Sting Rea Bay.
While there, on Sunday, April 29, he wrote :
? Hoisted y e boats out, and y e Capn" &c. attempting
to land was opposed by a few of y e Natives who dispersed
on being wounded with small ln y evening re
turned having found a watering place.?
Zackary Hickes notes their leaving Sting Rea Bay,
May Bth. Under latitude 34� 6" he writes;
? Moored in Sting Rea Bay the mouth of the Bay from
E. to N.E. \ E. distant from the shore f mile.?


On May 17 his progress was ?Sting ree bay 2� 00 EV?
The Chief Officer knew nothing of Botany Bay.
Rich d PICKERSGILL is the signature to what is called
? A Logg of ye Proceedings, &c.? He was master?s mate
for the ship. After stating on April 28 :
?Moor?d in Sting ray Bay,? it adds: ?April 29. At 3
theCCanp n &c went ashore and were opposed on landing by
2 of the Nat s whom they were obliged to sting with small
shot which frighted them into y e woods.?
On May 4 he notes ? striking Stingerrays.?
? May 5, 1770 ? Stingerray Bay lies in Lat d 34-06 S &
L� n g d W* of Long d on 207-43. It is form?d by two Low
P ts between which their is a passage of one mile with 12
f" 5 water on the E l side lies a Little Island and off y e S�
end of it is a Shore where the Sea some times Breaks
after you are in the Bay spreads and tends to y e w 1 ward
for about 6 or 7 Miles and then ends in two large Lagoons
off the S shores lies large flats with only 6 & 7 feet water
upon them is a great Quantity of Stingerrays the Bay is
very Shole but there is a Channel which lies open to y e
entrance with 5 and 6 f n water, but after you are two miles
within it sholes to 3 the Bay is about 4 Miles Broad and
has a regular tide. The Country is very rich and fertile
and has a fine appear we saw a large tree which grows
allone and yealds a Gum like Dragons Blood this we found
in great Quantitys sticking to y e Bark the Tree on which
it grows is very large & spreads, but does not grow Stright
nor tall besides we saw a wood which has a grain like oak
and would be very durable if used for Building the leaves
are like a Pine leaf the Soil is a light sandy black earth
mix?d but is very shallow upon digging we found vast
Quantitys of Oyster Shells which seem?d to have been
underground a great while We also found a Tree which
bore a red berry about y e size of a Cherry, but they grew
only in one Place?the inhabitants are so shy that we had
no kind of Intercous with them they us?d to come down
every evening arm?d with Lances and wooden Swords they
appeard very thin and had their faces Daub?d over with
some thing white one day as the Surgeon was walking in
the woods which is all clear of under wood he had a Lance
hove at him out of a tree but the man made of this was
all we saw of them except when they were fishing off in
their canoes which are very small & made of Bark they
carry one man who paddles with two small pieces of wood


they use them in striking fish on y e flats their Houses are
several Pieces of Bark sett up against an other & open at
each end and are the worst I ever saw_ the people have
nothing to cover themselves but go quite naked men �x
women, and are the most wretched sett I ever beheld or
heard of.?
Green?s Log is by the astronomer of the expedition.
He heads his page ? Coasting New Holland northward.?
Though he puts April 28 for 29, his Botany Bay visit is
thus recorded :
? Hoisted out the boats at 3 the Cap tn &c with Marines
and boat?s crew arm?d attempted landing but were opposed
on the rocks of Sandy beach by 2 Indians with 4 prong d
wooden fish gigs tipt at the ends with 4 fish bones and
fastened to y e wood with a gummy resinous substance;
one of them under cover of a shield approach?d the boats
and threw his Gig and in return was wounded with small
shot. They now fled & with them a woman and 6 or 7
?On the beach they found 3 or 4 canoes made of the
bark of a tree gather?d up at either end and stuck open
with a few sticks for thwarts ?the houses too (about 5)
were no more than angular Kennels made by binding a
niece of bark in the middle and resting either end on the
ground encreasing the N� of the pieces of bark according
to ye length desired.?
An unnamed log has the same account of the Bay.
The Log signed Cha Clerke is, like others of the eaily
Cook age, wholly innocent of a reference to Botany Bay .
This is its treatment of April 29th :
?Moored in Sting Rea bay. Little wind and fair
I past 1 came too with y e 8.8. in fa sandy ground
hoisted y e boats out. The Cap &c attempting to Land was
opposed by a few natives who dispersed on being wounded
by small shot, in y e evening they returned having found a
watering place.?
On Saturday, May 5, we read
? Moored in Sting Rea Bay.?
The WILKINSON?S Log ranges from June 22, 1768, to
August 3, 1770. Under April 29 we have this report
?Little wind and fair W | past 1 came too with the
Bower in 6J fm water, sandy ground. Hoisted out the


Boats at 3 P.M. the Capt and Mr. Banks and Dr. Sollander
went on Shore and was Opposed by the Natives at their
landing on account the Captain was obledg to Sting one
with Small Shot. After they all retired to the woods in
the Evening the Cap 1 having found a watering place ? &c.
On May 5 is recorded :
? Moored in Stingray Bay , New Holland.?
In ? A Logg of the Proceedings of His Majesty?s barque
Endeavour ,? commencing May 27, 1768, to September 26,
1770, Step 71 Forwood , gunner, writes :
?Remarks on Sting Ray Bay New Holland. Little
wind and fair weather | past 1 came too with B n B r in 6|
fath m water Sandy ground. Hoisted out the Boats and
the Cap 4 and Gentlemen went on Shore but were Opposed
in landing by two Indians standing on the Shore with
their Spears in their Hands Ready to heave at the Boat.
Notwithstanding the Cap 4 tried all Means to Perswaid
them to Lay their wapons down by Heaving them on
shore Presents but all to no purpose. At last finding
Nothing would do the Cap 4 fired a Load of small Shott at
them which so frightend them that they Run into the
woods After finding a watering Place the boats returned.?
An unsigned Log of the Endeavour was kept from
August 26, 1768, to September 28, 1770. Its account of
the Bay entered April 29 was:?
? Little wind & fair wea r J past 1 came too with the
B 4 Bower in fam Sandy Ground. Hoisting the Boats
out at 3 the Captain and Mr. Banks & Dr. Sollander
went on shore. They were opposed in attempting to land
by some of the Natives whom they were obliged to sting
with some shotts which frightened them in to the woods ?
in the Evening the Capt" Returnd having found a
watering Place.?
The Log in the possession of the Admiralty, differing
only in the inferiority of writing from that called the
Queen's Log, is similar to others and later so-called Cook?s
copies.
Neither of them cites the first named Stingray or Sting
Rea Bay. But the Admiralty Log records two sorts of


trees there, one hard, heavy and black like Lignum Vitce,
and the other ? tall and straight something like Pines.?
Then follows:
?The great quantity of new plants &c Mr. Banks &
Dr. Solander collected in this place occasioned my giving
it the name Botany Bay it is situated in the Lat 34 ?
11 S. Long 208 0 .?
The Admiralty Log notes what none of the old Cook?s
Logs knew.
? Abreast of a Bay or Harbour wherein there appeared
to be safe anchorage which I called Port Jackson it lies
3 Legs to the northw d of Botany Bay.?
Other Logs only notice it as an inlet, but add no name.
CORNER'S LOG.
Around this production the battle has raged awhile. As
it was exposed for sale more than once, failing to attract
attention, and had evidently been manipulated, suspicion
was naturally excited, and one well known official expert
assured me it was practically worthless, A bad impression
was made by the assertion of Mr. Corner that the Log was
in Cook?s handwriting. As the Record Office, as well as
the British Museum, could show a number of Cook?s own
letters, official and private, experts could not be deceived.
It may, nevertheless, have proceeded from the same
source as some others of a later date, as that one in Royal
Possession, and the one in the keeping of the Admiralty.
In fact, the latter is very similar in its text to Corner's Log,
always excepting the reference to Botany Bay instead of
Cook?s own appellation of Stingray Harbour , and the
insertion of the name of New South Wales , or New Wales ,
instead of the total absence of those words in ALL the Logs
of Cook and his officers.
It was evident to me, as to others, that several copies,
more or less similar, had been sent to England after the


last day?s record in any Log upon leaving New Holland,
the name of which is alone the heading of any page of a
Log.
I have not seen the so-called Queen's Log, but any one
who examined Corner's Log, as many did, would see that
it came here originally with blank spaces for certain days,
and others were vacant to receive the proper names of
places, which had, it is to be presumed, to be added in this
country! !
It is, however, not a little puzzling to find that Cook,
who is reported to have sent these copies from Batavia,
while staying there, should have allowed a copy for the
Admiralty to go off with New SOUTH WALES as the name
of the new territory, and send another (Corner?s) bearing
the denomination of New Wales. Still more extraordinary
that Cook?s own well ascertained Slogs, two in the British
Museum and one at Sunderland ?the only ones extant?
should have neither New South Wales, New Wales, nor
Botany Bay mentioned.
The knowledge of such circumstances might well have
caused experts to entertain doubts.
I had this hawked-about Log in my possession, and took
tracings of portions, satisfying a well-known historian, and
valued public officer at the Record Office, that the Log
before us had been tampered with.
Although one of the empty spaces had, as in other cases,
been filled up, in a handwriting different from that in the
text, as Port Jackson, which never appears in the Logs of
Cook and his officers, it was easy to suppose it referred
to a Secretary to the Admiralty, Sir George Jackson,
afterwards recognised as Sir George Duckett, the great
friend to Bishop Stortford.
Erasures and re-writing are not confined to Botany Bay.
Rockingham Bay has evidently had two earlier changes.
Halifax Bay has similarly suffered. If adopted, as some
fancy, as the Log used by Dr. Hawkesworth, considerable
freedom was used.


The signatures to all Cook?s genuine logs and copies is
Jam 8 Cook , with a grand flourish; but Corner?s has
James Cook only.
CORNER AND BOTANY BAY.
Corners Log , having been re-written, corrected in spell-
ing, &c., and afterwards printed and circulated as a
veritable Cook?s Log, what it had to say about Botany
Bay may reasonably excite the deepest interest and
attention.
In various Logs, elsewhere described, the Bay has been
called Sting Rea or Ray Harbour , and the reason stated in
Cook?s own words, and those of his chief officer, was on
account of the numbers of the fish Stingray , Skeats, or
Skate.
Corner?s, May 6th, says, on the contrary :
?The great quantity of plants Mr. Banks and Dr.
Solander found in this place occasioned my giving it the
name of Botany BayP
On May 30th we read of:
? The same sort of Water Fowl as we saw in Botany
BayS
We cannot avoid expressing surprise at finding that the
gentleman whose duty it was to fill up the vacant spaces,
purposely left open for the insertion of names of places,
was not always correct in orthography. He may have
intended always to write Botany , but varied it in Bottany ,
Bottony, Bottonest, Botony , Botanist.
He is not sure even when describing ? which I called
Port Jackson ,? as he is led to write, ?it lies 3 Leag s to the
Northw d of Botony Bay."
When, however, we come carefully to examine the full
original paragraph about Botany Bay, we seem to under-
stand the mode of action. The alteration was not made
by the first copyist of the Log, nor by one particular person


afterwards. There may have been some doubt even then
about the settlement, or else why the erasure of one way
of spelling, the substitution of another, and even traces of
further erasure before final arrangement of name.
It was this that excited my suspicions. I was very
candid in statement to some officials at the Admiralty of
my honest belief that there had been some foul play in
London. Later on, when I had again, with others, looked
at the real journals in the British Museum, regarded, and
copied, the Logs found at the Deptford Victualling Yard,
and especially had made personal inspection for three days
at Sunderland of a Log given by Cook himself to his old
Admiral, Sir Hugh Palliser, my doubts of this Log were
confirmed.
Let us now refer to the original Corner?s Log, transported
by purchase from Mr. Corner, to New South Wales, where,
if not further affected, it will be seen as I state.
If the reader mentally divide the Botany Bay story,
under May 6, he will discover first the usual Log tran-
scriber. In the space which he left, by somebody's order ,
he would perceive quite a different hand (? plants Mr.
Banks and Dr. Solander?). Then returns the first hand,
? found in this place occasioned my giving it the name of ?
. Another space is filled with a half erased second-
hand ? Botony ? followed by the word in original ? bay!'
In a tracing I took some years ago, under head of May 6,
I read : ? appeared to be safe anchorage which I called ? (in
original hand) ; but in the space adjoining, in the second
hand I read : ? Port Jackson Then, as usual, the first
resumed : ?it lies 3 Leag s to the Northw d of.? After a space,
or, rather, within the space, is a bungling ? Bottony " Bay.
Under May 13 we read; ?we found (in the space)
Bottonist Harbour.? Eight lines lower, though in distinctly
altered form, we read : ? saw at Botany Harbour.?
How different all this from the unaltered, unspaced
account by the Captain?s copy, given by himself to Sir
Hugh Palliser, in which it only says : ? The great Quantity


of these sort of fish found here occasion?d my giving it the
name of Stingray Harbour ? !
So it is hardly correct to say, ?It is, however, called
Botany Bay from the first in the Journals,? any more than
?No autograph Journal is, so far as is known, in existence.
The fact of this ?Corner?s Log? becoming another
ground for the publication of one, or many more, ? Cook's
Endeavour ,? can arise only from the supposition of its
likeness to the so-called ?Queen's Log ? and ? Admiralty
Log!' But these, admitted to be copies, cannot compare
with the one personally sent by Cook, with his signature,
to Palliser, or that sent to the British Museum as Cook?s
by his companion on the voyage, Sir Joseph Banks ; or
far more, that in Cook?s own hand and signature , as seen in
his own official letters.
Yet this Harbour was placed on a French map, dating
from the reign of our Henry VIII, as Bate des Herbages.
Geographers have not been the most reticent upon the
singularity and apparent after-thought of the name Botany
Bay. It was hardly to be expected that Cook, though a
skilled draftsman and interested in charts, would trouble
himself about old Mappemondes , dealing with localities that
were scarcely likely to come in his way, or, at any rate,
until his appointment to observe the Transit of Venus in
the Northern Pacific ; yet he was not ignorant of what
French navigators had done. In the British Museum one
may see his translation of a French Voyage from Havre up
the St. Lawrence. This copy is dated 1755- He ma Y>
therefore, be credited with the knowledge of French
Mappemondes before the Fronde Civil Wars; in which
charts, parts, at least, of Australia were delineated, and of
dates anterior to Dutch movements.
The Gazette Nationale of February 11, 1807, discusses
the question as to the possibility of Cook making acquaint-
ance of a celebrated map in London, before the Endeavour
sailed in August, 1768.


That wonderful and precious Dauphin Mappenwnde ,
which I have seen at the Museum, dating from 1542, might
not have been known to non-scientific Englishmen, but
found a home at last in our Museum. Was Dr. Solander,
Cook?s botanical fellow-voyager, curator at the Museum
when it arrived there ? Were he or his friend Banks aware
of its existence, or only learnt of it after their return ? On
that Map the whole eastern coast of New Holland, after-
wards known as New South Wales, is laid down distinctly.
In that case, there was no marvel in Cook?s striking
from New Zealand, in a direct line to the southern extremity
of that coast, at Cape Howe, and following the shore north-
ward, instead of seeking a connection with the Dutch
Nuyt?s discovery to the south-west. He would be going
over the old waters traversed by the ships from Spain and
Portugal,
That gorgeous Dauphin map had its places marked in a
sort of Frenchified Portuguese, as if a Dieppe cartographer
had not got hold of the right words, or had, for a purpose,
disguised them. Thereon, however, we read ?coste dan-
gerouse ? about the spot where Cook was afterwards
wrecked, as well as Baie des Plantes on the site of our
Botany Bay.
The Gazette Nationale writer notes that the Dauphin
map, marked with the Arms of Franee, was discovered, by
chance, in the house of a private person, and asks if the news
of it could have reached the Dutch, and so got known to a
few English before its real presence in London about 1767,
it not being there in 1766.
Referring to the Librarian, Solander, the French critic
of 1807 adds : ? That the denomination of Baie des Plantes ,
which he had read upon the Map confided to him, might
be a fresh stimulus in the hope of botanizing on this
unknown coast, since the memory of it no longer existed,
and particularly in a place designated by a name so attrac-
tive to him.?
It is curious that Cook gave Solander?s name to the


south point of the bay, ?as if,? says the French writer, ?he
were pleased to compliment his botanical friend, on per-
ceiving at length this land, the object of his desires, where
since it was already named the Bay of Plants , he must
have hoped to reap an ample harvest.
Yet the secret, if so, was well kept till after the voyage
of the Endeavour , since then only did the name of Botany
Bay appear in Dr. Hawkesworth?s work. In all Cook s
old Logs we see merely Stingray or Skeat Bay , and simi-
larly in all the Logs or journals of the chief officers and the
petty officers.
Or, had Dr. Hawkesworth, Cook, Banks and Solander
meanwhile made acquaintance with the appellation of Bate
des Plantes and appropriated it for history ? 1 his .theory
would account for the various alterations of Botany on
Corner?s Log.
THE TAKING POSSESSION OF IHE
TERRITORY.
The variations upon this subject are very remarkable.
Without noting what is contained in the so-called
� Official History? of the ?Voyage in the Endeavour ,? it must
be allowed that reported Logs of Cook, now in the posses-
sion of the Sovereign and the Admiralty, give the general
statement that Possession of the Territory was taken by
Cook after leaving the eastern side of New Holland, m the
usualform, in the name of the King, as New South Wales.
By that name Dr. Hawkesworth publicly acknowledges
the country in his work ; and by that name it has since
been known. It is so seen in the Admiralty Log, though
Corner calls it New WALES.
The official story of taking Possession, as given by
Dr. Hawkesworth, is as follows :
?As we were now about to quit the eastern coast of
New Holland, which I had coasted from latitude 38� to
this place, and which I am confident no European had
ever seen before, I once more hoisted English colours,


and although I had already taken possession of several
particular parts, I now took possession of the whole
eastern coast from latitude 38� to this place, lat. io� 55",
in right of His Majesty King George the Third, by the
name of New South Wales, with all the bays, harbours,
rivers and Islands situated upon it; we then fired three
vollies of small arms, which were answered by the same
number from the ship. Having performed this ceremony
upon the Island, which we called Possession Island, we
re-embarked in our boat, but a rapid ebb tide setting NE
made our return to the vessel very difficult and tedious.?
The Admiralty Log contains, like some other later
journals, this version :
? I now once more hoisted English Colours and in the
name of His Maj y - King George the Third took Possession
of the whole Eastern Coast from the above Lat d - down to
this place by the name of New South Wales together
with all the Bays Harbours Rivers and Islands situate
upon the said Coast upon which we fir?d 3 Volleys of
Small arms which were answer?d by the like number from
the ship.?
Although Corner?s Log resembles the Admiralty one so
nearly, being one among several copies made while Cook
was staying to refresh in Java, yet it, curiously enough,
calls the land New WALES, which according to me would
give the copy some priority to other copies thence.
Corner?s Log has this story of the Possession :
?The Eastern Coast from the sea of 38�. 1" down to
this place, I am confident was never seen or visited by
any European power before us and notwithstanding I had
in the name of his Maj y - taken possession of several places
on this coast, I now once more hoisting colours in the
name of His Maj. King George the Third took Possession
of the whole Eastern Coast from the above lat de - down to
this place by the Name of New Wales, together with all
the Bays.?
This log, therefore, commits Cook to the distinct affirm-
ation that he was the first European who had either seen
or visited any part of that eastern coast. He effectually
disposes of the claims of Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese
navigators.


Before dismissing this log, I would call attention to a
notable observation on the margin of one page, which I
recognised to be in Cook?s own handwriting, and which,
though no evidence of the log itself having been composed
by the Captain, must be reported as once having been
in his hand, at some time or other. Here are the words ;
?This day I restore Mr. Magra to his duty as I did not
find him guilty of the crimes laid to his charge.?
The crimes consisted in some ridicule of Orton, the
Captain?s clerk, when exhibiting himself in a state of intoxi-
cation. Magra, or rather Matra, a gentleman volunteering
for the voyage as a seaman, had, upon the discovery of
his ability, enforced by the active recommendation of
Mr. Banks, been made a midshipman, from which position
he had been degraded for a few days on account of the
part he was known to have taken in this frolic.
It is interesting and important here to note that this
very James Matra, travelling companion with Mr. (after-
wards Sir Joseph) Banks, was the direct instrument of the
establishment of the English Colony of New South Wales.
He, encouraged by Banks, petitioned the Ministry that the
land, even then recognized as New South Wales, should be
appropriated as a colony for English settlers in America,
who had lost their all in supporting the English Govern-
ment against the American rebels. Mr. Pitt, however,
preferred a settlement of persons taken from overcrowded
English gaols.
This log incorrectly signs the Captain?s name as James
Cook, not Jam\ the correct way, so continuously used by
himself.
An unnamed Deptford Log has this reference to the
taking possession on Wednesday, August 22, 1770 :
?At 6 Possession was taken of this country in his Maj? s -
Name &c. by hoisting a Jack on shore, this was announced
from the Ship with colours flying; the whole concluded
with 3 cheers.?


The astronomer, Mr. Green, is satisfied to copy Pickers-
gill, saying:?
?At 6 Possession was taken of this country in his
Majesty?s Name &c.; this was announced from the shore
by Vollies and answered from on b d ' Colours flying and
concluding with 3 cheers.?
One Log, unsigned by the writer, has a description of
taking possession in similar terms to those evidently pre-
pared on the voyage, saying :
?Aug. 22. The pinnace and yawl with the capt n - and
gentlemen went on shore to examine the contry and view
"the Coast, from one of the Hills some time after saw
some Turtle. At 6 Possession was taken of this contry
in his Majesty?s Name and under his Colours, fired severell
volleyes of small arms on y e Occasion and cheard 3 Times
which was answ d ' from y e ship ?.
Gunner Forwood has a short story on Possession ;
?The Capt m took Possession of the country in his
Majesty?s Name &c. This was announced from the shore
Vollies Fired and Colours flying from on board with D�-
concluding with 3 cheers.?
John Booties Log treats the Possession narrative in the
exact terms of another, saying :
?August 22. At 6 possession was taken of this locality
in his Majesty?s Name &c. This was announced from
the shore by Vollies and answered from on b d - with
Colours flying and concluding with 3 Cheers.?
Here, again, as in the other cases, the words ? New South
Wales ? do not occur.
The Palliser or Sunderland Log of Mr. Hudson?s may be
quoted:?
? Betwixt these two points we could see no land, so that
we were in great hopes we had found a passage into the
India Sea, but in order to be a little inform?d I landed
with a party of men on the Island which lays on the right
side of the Passage where from a hill I could see no lands
in the above direction Before and after we anchor?d we
saw many of the Natives upon this Island, but they all
fled upon my landing ?a little before Sun sett I took


Possession of the country in His Majesty?s Name, and
fired a volley of small arms on the occasion, which was
answered from the ship.?
On this Possession subject we have the weightiest
authority, Cook?s autograph Log , Museum Catalogue , 27,885
for August 22, when leaving the Australian coast:
?We were in great hopes that we had found a passage
into the India Sea but in order to be better inform?d I
landed with a Party of men on the Island which lays to
the S.E. side of the Passage where from a hill saw no land
in the above direction. Before and after we anchor?d we
saw a good many of the Natives upon this Island but they
all fled upon my landing. A little before sunsett I took
possession of the Country in His Majesty?s name and
fired 3 Volleys of small arms on the occasion which was
answerd from the ship. High water at 4 o clock, &c.
Banks's Log (of Cook), 8959 Museum Catalogue,
remarked :
? The Pinnace and Yawl with the Capt n - and gentlemen
went on shore to Examine the Country and view the Coast
from one of the Hills soon after saw some Turtle. It was
high water. When we came too the 1 ide of Ebb set
from the S.W. sk. 2m. per hour. At 6 possession was
taken of this Country in his Majesty?s name and under
his Colours fired several volleys of small arms on the
occasion and cheer?d 3 times which was answer?d from the
ship.?
In each case of Cook?s real Logs no name of any kind
would appear to have been selected for the country, else, in
all probability, it would have been stated in one or in both
Logs.
The Chief Officer, Lieut. Hickes, knew nothing of taking
possession of the land in the King?s name as New South
Wales.
His Log for August 21 refers to Chacho Harbour:
?Wednesday 22. Latt. io� 45" Long, made W. from y e
Straits oo� 13. These Straits are in Longitude 142� 25 E?.
The Capt n- went on shore, hoisted y e Colours and took
possession of y e Country for y e King, fired several volleys
and cheered 3 times which was answered from y e Ship, at
xo a.m. slack water weighed and made sail.?


The Log of Richard Pickersgill gives this short version,
imitating or being imitated :
?At 6 Possession was taken of this country in his
Majesty?s Name and this was announced from the shore
by Vollies and answer?d from on b' 1, Colours flying and
concluding with 3 cheers.?
The Cook's Log presented by Sir Joseph Banks to the
British Museum, and catalogued therein as 8959, is the
most important of what Logs I, as an archivist, would
regard the genuine Cook?s, as it was sanctioned by the
authority of a fellow voyager.
The quotation from this Log, on the taking possession
of the territory, runs thus:
? Mod. and clear wea r- saw a number of smoaks along
shore at 1 Lay too for the yawl, Pinnace and Longboat,
Sounding J p?- 2 made sail and steer?d for a passage,
Between some Islands and the Main at 3 fired a gun and
made the Signed for the Boats to sound the next Passage,
to the N.ward of the above Mention?d | p'- 3 was in the
Passage Dist ce - from Each shore fof a mile?saw several
Indians who follow?d us shouting. At 4 fir?d a gun and
made the Signed for the Boats. Came too with the B?-
Bower in 6| fa" 1, good ground Veer?d to \ a Cable. Ext e-
of the Land on the East side No. 56 E l, an Island to S.W.
the Main on the W t- side from N.S.E. to S. 73 W t- 8 miles
Uist ce- from the Eastern shore One mile. The Pinnace
and yawl with the Capt n - and Gentlemen went on shore to
Examin the Country and view the Coast from one of the
Hills. Soon after saw some Turtle it was high water.
When we came too, the Tide of Ebb set from the S.W.
3k. 2m. Prp r - Hour, at 6 possession was taken of this
Country in his majesty?s name and under his Coulours
P'ired several volleys of small arms on the occasion and
Cheer?d 3 times, which was answer?d from the ship.?
There is, therefore, in the most orthodox Logs of H.M.S.
Endeavour , not any authority for the names of Botany Bay
and New South Wales .


END.
In a capital sketch of Captain Cook, appearing in the
Sydney Town and Country Journal on February 22, 1879,
when the noble New South Wales statue to Captain Cook
was unveiled, the writer observed, ?what the legendary
TEneas was to Rome, Captain James Cook is to Eastern
Australia
Though the remark only referred to the remarkable
wanderings by both men over various seas, the word
legendary may, in a way, be applied to the two. The
voyage of the Trojan has been regarded by the learned
men of Europe as mythical, or, at least, explanatory of
shifting reckonings of time, or to such groupings of
constellations as should elucidate human fancies, and the
inventions of quasi-historians.
TEneas was but a poetical creation, and Cook was a
living hero of the ocean. Yet, around the narratives of
Cook?s first southern voyage, when he was said to have
discovered Eastern Australia, have gathered so many
mysteries, as almost to give them the colour of myths.
Suspicions regarding the official account of the voyage
arose at an early date. It leaked out, from those who had
accompanied Cook, that the recorded official Admiralty
narrative did not agree with their recollection of the
several facts. The death of the author soon after the issue
of his work increased the embarrassment as to the source of
the materials from which he made his compilation. The
second of Cook?s voyages, so ably described by the Dean
of Windsor, had the advantage of genuine logs, together
with the presence and active assistance of the navigator
himself. It unfortunately happened that most of the
actors in the first or New Holland voyage were out of
reach for questions whilst the story was being written.
Dr. Hawkesworth meant to prepare as interesting a
narrative as he could, and tried to please home parties as


flatteringly as circumstances permitted. Thus, men of
science would be gratified by the selection of the place
as Botany Bay, an Admiralty ofificer would be glad of
the adoption of his name in Port Jackson , while the
Dutch appellation of New Holland gave place to the more
British one of New South Wales. Even Torres Strait , that
honoured the navigators of Spain and Portugal, surrendered
to the English name of Endeavour Strait.
The value of Cook?s second voyage in the Resolution ,
which was brought out by the Dean of Windsor, had the
advantage of good logs, with the presence of Captain Cook
at its revision, and was, consequently, never questioned as
that of the Endeavour had been under the editorship of
Dr. Hawkesworth, which had a far more novel and
romantic story to tell.
In a remarkable letter to Sir Joseph Banks by John
Frederick Schiller, German translator of Hawkesworth?s
voyage, and dated November 14, 1773, the writer expresses
the deep concern of a German bookseller at the wrong
done to the sale of this translation by some published
remarks in England, impugning the correctness of the
official Admiralty narrative. He therefore seeks ?some
lines ? from Sir Joseph, as Cook?s fellow voyager, in
refutation of those injurious assertions. The German
scholar adds : ? Mr. Berber, an eminent mineralogist, says
he has of late made a literary tour through Europe, and
after his return from England asserted at Berlin that
? Not only the respective Commanders, Messrs. Biron,
Wallis, Carteret, &c., had publicly protested against Dr.
Hawkesworth?s account of their voyages, as containing
misrepresented facts, but also that especially Messrs.
Banks and Solander had publicly declared that they had
never delivered any Papers of theirs into that Editor?s
hands, and that the Public was to wait for their own
narrative, which was to be published within 3 or 4 years.?
Mr. Schiller goes on to say : ? In order to support these
assertions, Mr. Berber is said to have produced a letter
which he affirmed to have received from Mr. Banks, and in


which all these assertions are plainly expressed and
corroborated.?
If, then, suspicions were excited immediately after the
publication of our authorised and popular version of Cook?s
v �y a g e , it is not surprising that turther investigation, as
now made, should develop renewed scepticism. The recent
record of the London Press that the Corners Log had been
pronounced by the Admiralty experts to be genuine, and
in Cook?s own handwriting, might well puzzle outsiders.
Had Sir Joseph Banks publicly answered the appeal of
Mr. Schiller in 1773, and satisfied the world as to the
authenticity of Dr. Hawkesworth?s story, the necessity of
any subsequent controversy might have been avoided. In
that appeal to Banks and Solander ? in the cause of Truth,
of Justice, of Honour and Humanity,? we read that the two
naturalists ? intend to publish in five or six years hence, in
sixteen or eighteen folios and two thousand copper plates,
and totally unconnected with Dr. Hawkesworth?s narrative.
Such a great work did not appear. Why not? History
does not tell.
There has been sufficient reason for the present writer?s
long silence upon this inquiry, and particularly since he
had reported on Cook?s logs some six years ago.
Now, however, as the acting archivist is just entering his
eighty-fifth year, Colonial friends here deemed it a proper
time for the printing of this pamphlet in the cause of
Truth, Justice, and Honour, it being his last contribution
to Colonial history, the series of which began in 1845 by
the publication of his Geography for Australian Youth ,
which was the first production, by the Australian Press, of
any Geography of Australia.
