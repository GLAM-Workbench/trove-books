P R E F A C E.
The Composer Of these little poems has been totally blind
and paralysed for the past eight years. Before his affliction
he had. neither the inclination nor the ability to put two lines
together, and it is only during the last two years that he has
had the' desire manifested to praise the Lord in PSALMS,
and HYMNS and SPIRITUAL SONGS.
The verses usually come, as it were from the Lord)
in the long silent night, as a balm to soothe in times of
extreme agony, and thus the pilgrim is Cheered on his
Heavenly way. In the morning they are dictated to his dear
wife who copies them down.
In sending this little edition forth it is with the sincere
desire that other suffering Christians may be comforted in
their trials of faith, and that the careless may be awakened to
see their great need of. One to save them from the. wrath to
come. Committing it to the care of Him in whose sight no
service is reckoned small, and who commended the poor
widow for her two mites.
Faithfully yours,
The Publisher.


A PRAYER FOR GRACE.
“ Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for ns a far more
•exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.”—2 Cor. iv. 17.
0 Father, now, to thee I pray,
While prostrate on my bed I lay,
O give me patience, strength, and grace,
Hide not from me Thy loving face.
But let Thy light upon me shine,
And fill my soul with love divine ;
Let all my thoughts be fixed on Thee,
From now unto eternity.
Increase my faith from day to day,
And keep me in the narrow way,
And O, sweet Jesus, to me give
Thy peace while on this earth I live.
O gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
In mercy help thy Father’s child,
And draw me nearer, nearer Thee,
Thou blessed Lamb of Calvary.
And when this troubled life is o’er,
O, Thou wilt guide me to that shore,
Where all is peace, and joy, and hive,
From whence we ne’er desire to rove.
THE BRIGHT STAR.
(“Given when 1 jin >4 in the silent night in dreadful agony.”)
“I am . . , . the bright ami Morning Star.”-Rev. xxii. 18.
I am the Bright and Morning Star,
My beams I shed both near and far ;
I’m this world’s light, I shine so bright,
"Where’er I am there is no night.
In darkness, brethren, do not stay,
I am the Light, the Truth the Way ;
Come, brethren, all from near and afar,
And follow the Bright and Morning Star.
Watch, brethren watch, where’er ye be,
On mountain top or stormy sea ;
Be ready and come from near and afar,
And watch for the bright and Morning Star


THE VISION.
It was a bright and sunny morn,
The air was soft and mild ;
As a mother sat with tearful eyes
By the side of her dying child.
0 mother, I have had a dream,
And pretty sights I have seen,
Last night to me a vision came,
And One called me three times by my name.
And in a voice, so sweet and clear,
Said “ I am with thee, do not fear ;
Trust in Me as your steadfast Friend
And I’ll be with you to the end.”
Through the long and weary horns
Of the dark and silent night,
Angel bands are watching o’er thee,
Thou art never out of sight.
Fear thou not, then little brother,
For I love thee very dear
When the pangs of death assail thee,
I’ll be with thee, do not fear.
And then a band of angels came,
So holy, pure and bright,
And filled my room with music sweet,
It was a glorious sight.
1 then awoke, but they had gone,
That bright and holy band ;
And the One I know' that spake to me
Was Calvary’s gentle Lamb.
THE SINNER’S WARNING
“Turn ye! Turn yo from your evil ways for why will you die.”—
Ezek. xxxiii. 11.
Tremble, sinner, fear and tremble,
Turn now from your evil way;
For the time is fast approaching,
Soon will come the Judgment Fay.
Christ will come in all His glorv,
With His Saints and Angel band ;
Then the righteous and the holy
He will place on His right hand.


On His left He’ll place the wicked,
And to them their sentence tell;
I know ye not, depa”t ye cursed
Into everlasting hell.
All their groans and cries for mercy
On that day will be in vain ;
For the Lord He will not hear them,
Mercy’s gone and Justice reigns.
Tremble, sinner, for the sentence
You’ll receive on that great day;
Repent at once and come to Jesus,
He will save you, don’t delay.
THE DYING CHRISTIAN’S DREAM
“Blessed and liolv is he that hath part in the first resurrection."—
Eev. xx. 6.
The sun was shining bright and clear,
The birds sang low and sweet;
And perfume from the Pink and Rose,
Gave quite a fragrant treat.
In the centre of the garden stood,
A little cottage made of wood ;
The Ivy round its porch did twine,
And pretty flowers of Jessamine.
On a humble bed in that cottage lay,
A Christian whose spirit was passing away,
From this cold earth to realms above
Where all is peace, and joy, and love
Around his bed his parents knelt,
His sister and his brother,
Waiting to hear his last farewell,
When he faintly called out “ Mother.”
“ 0 Mother, dear, come close to me,
I’ve had a dream, I’ll tell it thee ;
I dreamt last night an angel band
Carried me off to Beulah land.
And tliere upon the golden strand,
My Saviour took me by the hand,
And in a voice, so sweet and mild,
He said I was llis Father’s child


The Saints arrayed in robes of white
And golden crowns that shone so bright ;
The Heavenly chorus loud did sing,
Hosanna to their Lord and King.
I then awoke, and the glorious sight
Made my soul eager for its flight;
To join that pure and holy band,
And dwell with them in glory land.
O, mother dear, my eyes grow dim,
The angels are coming—l hear them sing ;
They’re here, dear mother, O let them in,
I hear the flutter of their wings.
O, loved ones all, farewell, farewell,
I’m going now with Christ to dwell;
At Zion’s bright and pearly gate,
For thee, beloved, I’ll watch and wait,
You must not fret, you must not cry,
As I bid you all the last good-bye ;
And may you say, like God’s dear Son,
‘Father, Thy will, not mine be done.’ ”
THE SAVIOUR’S CALL.
“ Clirist died for tlie ungodly.”—Rom. v. 6.
Come, brethren, listen to the call,
Of Christ your Lord and King ;
Inviting all poor sinners,
There burden’s now to bring.
Come unto Me, ye weary ones,
And I will give you rest ;
Come all ye heavy laden
And lean upon My breast.
Oh ! blessed invitation,
To sinners one and all ;
Let not your hearts be hardened
Do not reject His call.
He is your loving Saviour,
He is the sinner’s friend ;
His love for you is wonderous
And will never, never end.


He left His home in glory,
To seek and save the lost ;
He laid His life down for you,
In suffering on the cross.
tie rose again triumphant,
The third day from the grave,
And now all power is given Him
The lost and vile to save.
And soon He’ll come in glory,
From that bright and heavenly homo ;
And kings and priests redeemed by blood.
Will praise Him on His Throne.
A MOTHER'S LAMENT .
“But now be i.s dead Can I bring him buck again? I shall
go to him. but he shall not return to me."—2 Sum, xfi.. 23.
It was a cold and dismal night,
The storm was raging wild,
As a mother in frantic anguish cried,
O’er the corpse of her lovely child.
Thou art gone, alas ! my darling,
And left me hereto mourn;
My heart with sorrow is i reaking,
I wish I ne’er was born.
O, you were all I had to love,
My blessing and my pride ,
The joy and comfort of my heart
Since your dear father died.
I loved you with a mother’s love—
Such love no tongue can tell;
You were the idol of my heart,
My pretty blue-eyed Bell.
No more that little prattling tongue,
Will tell thy love to me ;
And say, Mama, I want to sleep,
Sing me sweet lullaby.
Those little pouting ruby lips
That laughed with so much glee ;
Those preity eyes that twinkled so '
I never more shall see.


Farewell my pretty 1 lossom,
A little saint you’ll be ;
And in sweet love for ever rest
With the Lamb of Calvary.
Down by the weeping willows
A little grave is made ;
I’ll lay my darling down to rest
Beneath their sheltering shade.
And every morn I’ll take a walk,
Down to that sacred spot,
And plant all o’er that little grave
Some sweet forget-me-nots.
The Summer sun will come and go,
The Winter’s wind and rain ;
And Spring and Autumn in their turn
Will go and come again.
ButO, my little blooming bud,
So joyous once and free ;
Will never, never, come again,
Will ne’er return to me.
Farewell, farewell, my pretty Bell,
My load on Christ I’ll cast;
And He will all my troubles 1 ear
And give me joy at last.
Fair Rose of Sharon, heal her grief,
And give the broken heart relief;
Her hope and trust are all in Thee,
0, blessed Lamb of Calvary.
THE OUTCAST’S PRAYER.
“ E u now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes wore far off are mam ;:i£fh
by the blond of Chri-t Kph. ii. 18.
O, Lamb of God ! my heart is full
Of gratitude to Thee,
For the peace which Thou hast given,
To a poor outcast like me.
From the tempter’s cruel bondage,
From His strong and mighty chain ;
Thou hast wrought a great deliverance
And hath set me free again.


By Thy prayer down in the garden,
By the thorns which pierced Thy brow,
By Thy wondrous love and mercy
I am thine for ever now.
By Thy death upon the mountain.
By Thy blood which there did flow,
In that precious crimson fountain
Thou hast washed me white as snow.
A CHRISTMAS STORY.
‘ We spend our years as a tale that is told.”- -Psalm xc. 9.
Come, children, listen unto me,
And gather round about my knee •
A little story I will tell,
About the One we love so well.
T’is very near two thousand years
Since Jesus Christ was born ;
O, how I love to sing His praise,
On every Christmas morn.
He was the blest Messiah
Who did Salvation bring ;
Jehovah’s great redemption,
And remedy for sin.
He was the Man of Sorrow”
Acquainted with our grief ;
He was the “ Great Physician,”
And always gave relief.
He cleansed the leper with a word.
And bade the devils fly ;
For Jesus was the Son of God,
They could not Him defy.
Now when He walked upon this earth,
A poor and hum hie Man ;
He preached His Father’s word, and healed
The sick throughout the land.
His Father to Him power gave,
Sins to forgive, poor souls to save,
And all who came and did believe,
A Messing from Him did receive.


The de;icl arose at His command,
The blind He healed by touch of hand.
Leprous and palsied were made whole,
He healed them both in body and souL
His disciples then He did command,
To preach the Word in every land ;
“ (to heal the sick, the blind and lame,
And cast out devil’s in My name ”
The disciples then at His command,
Did preach the Word in every land ;
They healed the sick, the blind and lams.
And cast out devil's in Jesu’s name.
For this great love Jesus was tried,
By cruel men was crucified ;
They scourged and nailed Him to the tree.
At a place they call Mount Calvary.
But what a victory He did win,
He conquered death, the grave, and sin j.
The Holy Spirit the third day came,
And raised Him up to life again.
For forty clays He walked about,
Upon this earth again ;
And to the Apostles showed Himself,
And five hundred brethren.
And now His work on earth was done,
The Scriptures were fulfilled ;
He came, He suffered, and He bled,
He died as God had willed.*
In all His glory now He stands,
At God’s right hand on high ;
To intercede for all His saints,
Who unto Him do cry.
And soon He’ll come with mighty shout.
And trumpets deafening blast ;
To call His Bride from near and far,
To reign with Him at last.
And all who have His love refused,
His pardon madly spurned ;
Like chaff and straw are cast away,
Whose end is to be burned.
•Psalms xl 8.


God grant that you my children dear,
May trust the Lamb of God ;
And ever rest on Jesus’ breast,
Redeemed by precious Blood.
JUDGMENT DAY.
“I saw a great white throne and Him that sac on it.” —Rev. xx. 11.
O ! tremble sinner for the day,
When you are called from earth away;
If you are not prepared to meet
Jehovah on His Judgment Seat.
The day of reckoning soon will come
When you will stand before the Throne,
And there be judged by Christ the Son
According to the works you’ve done.
0 ! tremble, tremble, if you stand,
Before the Throne a sinful man ;
Your awful doom the Lord will tell,
Depart ye cursed into hell.
And there for ever to remain,
All cries for mercy will be vain ;
The answer from the Lord will be,
I know ye not, ye knew not Me.
C) ! dreadful thought! there to remain,
In misery and endless pain ;
No kind voice there, good news to tell,
There is no sympathy in hell.
Oli! sinner come, do not delay,
For time is fleeing fast away ;
Repent, at once—’tis mercy’s day,
Oh come to Jesus, while you may.
THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD.
A HYMX OF PRAISE. Tnne--“ Hiding in TJiee.”
The Lord is my Shepherd, then why do I fear
When sorrow, or trials, or dangers draw near ;
My troubles and cares to His feet I will bring,
Oh, hide me, sweet Jesus, safe under thy wing.
Hide me in Thee,
Hide me in Thee ;
Thou rock in a weary land,
Hide me in Thee.


He is the Good Shepherd—there’s none can surpass
The love He has shown me from the first to the last ;
And now by His side for ever I’ll cling,
Oh hide me sweet -lesus safe under Thy wing.
Hide me in Thee, etc
Thy prayer in the garden of Gethsemane,
Thy blood on the Cross from sin set me free ;
My blessed Redeemer Thy praises I’ll sing,
Oh, hide me, sweet Jesus, safe under Thy wing.
Hide me in Thee, Fc.
THE LOST LAMB.
All we like sheep have gone astray.”—lsa. liii. 6
Far away on the mountains, away —far away,
A poor little lamb from the flock there did stray ;
And at night when the flock were asleep in the fold,
That poor little lamb was out in the cold.
The shepherd—a good and kind hearted man,
Said “ A search I will make for that poor little lamb ;
My heart it is sad when I look in the fold,
And miss the poor lost one that’s out in the cold.”
The Shepherd then started without more delay
To And the poor lamb that had wandered away,
And at last on the mountain with joyful surprise
He heard what he knew to be the lamb’s cries.
He ran to the place from whence came the sound.
And to his great joy the lost one he found ;
He carried it home in his arms from the cold,
And placed it quite safe with the flock in the fold.
E’en so in safe keeping there were ninety and nine,
But one soul afar off, and that soul was mine ;
And the Good Shepherd came, my lost soul to restore,
And brought me safe back in the arms of His power.
Oh, keep me, dear Shepherd, close—close to Thy side,
With Thy rod and Thy staff, I pray Thou wilt guide ;
Until to the glory my soul wings its way
To praise and adore Thee throughout endless day.
BE YE HOLY.
1 Peter i. Pi.
Be ye holy, little children,
Love, obey, and keep My Word;
Be ye kind to one another,
And you’ll get a rich reward.


In my Father’s house are mansions,
I’ve prepared them for you all;
There are rooms for all who love Me,
All are welcome, great and small.
Those pearly gates you cannot enter,
Except you are from sin set free;
And to dwell in God’s bright city,
You must pure and holy be.
Comfort ye, M3 7 little children,
I will guide you, I’m the Way ;
Trust in Me your loving Saviour,
Be ye holy, watch and pray.
THE DYING INFIDEL.
“ Behold ye despisers and wonder and perish.”—Acts xiii. 41.
The thunder rolled—the lightning flashed
O’er mountain, hill, and dell :
When fear and sorrow tilled the heart,
Of the dying Infidel.
u Dear friends ” he cried. “ I’m very weak,
My eyelids will not close in sleep;
I’m lost—l’m lost—my heart doth tell,
I’m going fast, —fast down to hell.”
You know I was an Infidel,
I loved not Ood, I feared not hell;
I laughed and scoffed, and made a boast,
And cursed the mighty Lord of Hosts.”
Like lightning’s flash, across my brain
The truth has come, with dreadful pain;
O yes, the truth—l know quite well
There is a God—a Heaven—a Hell.
’Twas only just last Thursday morn,
I laughed the name of Christ to scorn;
Oh ! dreadful thought! soon 1 must meet
That Christ upon His judgment seat.
Dear friends, pray turn ye, while you can,
Believe no more the thoughts of man,
Or very soon, like me, you’ll be
Cast into hell for eternity.


I cannot pi ay—’tis too late now :
I feel death’s cold hand on my brow ;
I cannot sleep—l cannot rest —
Hell hath commenced within my breast.
***** -15-
Look friends-what are those forms I see
Glaring so hideously at me 1
’Tis Satan’s imps come up from hell,
To claim their own—the Infidel.
THE WRONG TRACK .
*• Then shall ye remember your evil ways.—Ezek. xxxvi. 31. “lumthe
way.”—John xiv. 6.
While walking one day in the middle of June,
And praising the Lord for a tine afternoon ;
I met a poor man with a load on his back,
Crying—help me, O, help me, I’m on the wrong track !
I have carried this load for many a vear .
Of sinners I’m chief, for God I’d no fear ;
But no longer I’ll carry this load on my back,
For something now tells me I’m on the wrong track.
“ Good stranger ” lie cried, “ can you show me the way,
How to find out the One who will help me to-day ;
And take this great load from off my poor back—
0, help me, kind friend ! put me on the right track.
With pleasure, dear brother, I’ll show you the way,
Come kneel down with me, and to Father we’ll pray :
That Jesus may take that great load off thy back,
And bless you and put you upon the right track.
Come listen dear brother, for Jesus did say,
“ Behold I’m the Truth, the Life and the Way ”
If you love and obey Him, that load on your back,
He’ll remove, and set you upon the right track.
ECHO FROM THE VALLEY.
Come brethren, now let us unite,
And sing and shout with all our might;
Let the valleys echo loud and strong,
In answer to our holy song.
O, Rock of Ages, I will cling
For shelter ’neath Thy mighty wing ;
All storms and tempests I defy,
While under Thy protecting eye.


All glory to the Lamb of God,
Our Prophet, Priest and King ;
Who by His blood upon the cross,
Redeemed us from all sin.
Come let us sing with might and main,
Hosanna to His holy name;
Let the valleys echo loud and strong,
In answer to our holy song.
O, had I the wings of an eagle I’d fly
To beautiful Zion, God’s city on high ;
And there in sweet rest for ever to be,
In the mansion prepared by Jesus for me.
THE GOOD SHEPHERD.
“ I am the Good Shepherd,” Lord Jesus did say ;
u My sheep know My voice,” and never will stray ;
“ And no one can pluck them from out of My hand,
Not one shall be missing from sweet Beulah Land.
I am the Good Shepherd,” I love my poor sheep,
My watch I keep o’er them when all are asleep;
No wolves can attack them at night in the fold—
For I am their Shepherd, their mighty stronghold.
I am the Good Shepherd,” to My Father I’ll bring
All the sheep I have gathered safe under my wing ;
And when they are all gathered safe in the fold,
Their Shepherd I’ll be in the City of Gold.
“ I am the Good Shepherd,” My love was so deep
I gave up My life to save My poor sheep ;
And to all my loved ones a mansion I’ll give,
And in Zion for ever with Me they shall live.
"HOW LONG, LORD.”
“ My soul longeth, yea, even fltinteth for the courts of the Lord.”—
PsiihH, Ixxxiv. 2.
0 }iow I long for tliat glad day,
When I am called from earth away;
And Jesus with His Angel band,
Will guide me to the Promised Land.
1 long to walk the golden strand,
And join that holy ransomed band ;
Arrayed in robes of spotless white,
And golden crowns that shine so bn ght.


I long, O, how I long to see
The gentle Lamb, that died for me,
And hear the angels near the throne
Sing me a welcome, welcome home.
FRET YE NOT.
Psalm xxxvii. 1.
Fret not for evil doers,
Kor take heed of slandering tongues ;
Though they pierce thee like an arrow,
In Christ thou shalt them overcome.
Fear them not, they cannot harm thee,
Though thy body they may pain ;
And thy heart be tilled with sorrow,
Christ will give thee peace again.
Walk upright, and be ye holy :
Of evil passions have a dread —
Thou shalt never be forsaken,
Kor thy seed go begging bread.
Though the wicked seem to prosper,
In great wealth and lofty pride ;
Lo, the time is fast approaching,
When they will be cast aside.
Trust the Lord and be ye righteous,
And your end shall be sweet peace;
Your Father’s watchful eye is on thee,
His love for thee will never cease.
PARTAKERS OF THE INHERITANCE.
“Heirsof G-O'l and j j[nt-heii*< with Christ." —Rom.viii. 17
Come brethren, now let us rejoice,
We are the sons of Cod, His choice ;
For He hath said in Heaven we’ll be
Joint-heirs with the Lamb of Calvary.
Come, let us now rejoice and sing,
Hosanna to the Heavenly King
Who hath appointed us to be
Joint-heirs with the Land) of Calvary.


Come, brethren, now join in the song,
We are going home, ’twill not be long ;
And when at home w T e are to be
Joint-heirs with the Lamb of Calvary.
Come, brethren, now let us rejoice,
And praise Jehovah for His choice,
In choosing us joint-heirs to be
With Christ, the Lamb of Calvary.
A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH .
"If we suffer we shall also reign."—2 Tim. ii. 12.
Almighty God, to Thee I come,
In Jesu’s Name Thy beloved Son ;
0, make me humble, meek, and mild,
As simple as a little child.
0, Father, now my faith increase,
And help, oh help my unbelief ;
My trust, 0 Lord, is all in Thee,
Remove all doubts, and set me free.
When in the lonely hours of night
Satan appears as an Angel of Light,
And when my body’s rack’d with pain,
His fiery darts he shoots like rain.
And in his cunning, crafty way,
Whispers softly, “ Do not pray,
’Twill only, now, your pain increase,
And God will give thee no relief.”
And if I seem to hesitate,
Another dart he’ll shoot and wait;
But 0, that dart awakens me
Thou tempter, I’ll not yield to thee.
Thou Prince of Darkness art a liar,
My God will grant all I require ;
And when I pray in Jesu's name,
Blessings come down like showers of rain,
And then a voice so sweet and mild
'Whispers to me, “ Have faith, ray child;
Pray on and trust, be of good cheer,
Lo 1 I am with thee, do not fear.

The Pilgrim Band.
Strangers and pilgrims on tbe earth.— Heb. xi. 18-14.
We are a band of Pilgrims
Bound for the Golden Shore,
Where all is peace and happiness
And sorrow is no more,
And as we journey onward
With God’s sword in our hand
We’ll fight the foe on every side
Throughout this hostile land.
We are a band of Pilgrims
And we are going to preach
The Gospel to the poor outcast
And bring the sick relief ;
And as we journey onward
To sinners we will tell
How Jesus did from Heaven come down
And conquer Death and Hell.
We are a band of Pilgrims,
And we are going to sing
How Jesus Christ was crucified
To pay the debt of sin,
And as we journey onward,
O, God, Thy Spirit give,
And help us in our work of love
While on this earth we live.
