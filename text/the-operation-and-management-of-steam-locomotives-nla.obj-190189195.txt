INTRODUCTION.
TTI
To the young Trainee Engineman just beginning his
Railway Career it may sometimes appear that the path from
engine cleaning to locomotive driving is a long and arduous one.
He should, however, in his ambition to attain to the
position, first of Locomotive Fireman, and ultimately to that
of a Locomotive Driver, realise that these are both extremely
responsible posts, and that he will not be qualified to carry
out the duties required in either until he is fully conversant
with both the Safe Working Regulations and the elements and
technique of Locomotive Management, and has the requisite road
knowledge•
It is during his engine-cleaning period that the
foundation of the future Driver's career is laid. To be smart,
civil, and obliging, to show keen interest in everything per-
taining to locomotives, and to railway work, and to have any
engine allotted to his care well cleaned, these are the recom-
mendations in his favour for which those concerned in his future
promotion will look in the young man who has become a Trainee
Engineman.
So as to be in readiness for the time when he will be
called upon to serve as an Acting Fireman, it is important that,
initially, the Trainee Engineman should make himself acquainted
with the different types of oil cans, tools, fire irons, etc.,
used, and be ready at all times to give a helping hand to any
Driver, or Fireman, if required, taking particular care also to
memorise the locations of all the various details on the
different classes of locomotives which require oiling.
Lastly, in connection with this Book, it should be
understood that it is the aim of the Authors to provide not only
the Trainee Engineman, but also the appointed Fireman and Driver
with a description of the basic principles involved in the
design, working and management of steam locomotives, and by
supplying the technical information and data which has been
included to assist them to become highly skilled in all phases
of locomotive operation, and train working. By such means it
is hoped that those who have chosen the career of a Locomotive
Engineman (and whose interests this Book is designed to serve)
will become efficient in each step as they progress towards the
final goal, which is the attainment of the proud position of a
top rank Locomotive Engine Driver, and that they will ultimately
find themselves discharging the duties of the latter calling
with the satisfaction of knowing that they are fully masters of
a craft which, for the combination of skill, knowledge and
judgment required, together with the exercise of that
unremitting vigilance that is ever needed when running a railway
train, and for the heavy responsibility attaching, is one that
is without rival in the Railway Service.

T^T
In railway working, as in all other specialised
callings, there are many terms peculiar to the industry only.
Therefore, in order to assist the Trainee Engineman when first
entering the field a number of the more commonly used terms,
with definitions of their meanings, are given as follows
(a) RAILWAY LOCOMOTIVE - is the term used to describe any
self-propelled machine which, being mounted on wheels, and
running on rails, is used for the purpose of hauling other kinds
of railway vehicles.
(b) STEAM ENGINE - is a mechanical contrivance devised for the
purpose of converting the energy of steam, under pressure, into
mechanical energy in the form of motion. In the case of the
reciprocating type it possesses cylinders, valves, pistons,
crossheads, connecting rods and cranks, etc,, whereby the
pressure of the steam, driving the pistons to and fro in the
cylinders, is made to turn a wheel, or wheels. In the case
of a steam locomotive the wheels thus turned are the driving
wheels of the engine concerned which, by the frictional grip
exercised on the rails, results in the locomotive itself moving
along same. In railway work, also, the term "engine" is often
used to denote a locomotive.
(c) STEAM BOILER - is a vessel provided for generating and
supplying steam under pressure, usually for the purpose of
operating a steam engine. In the case of a steam locomotive
it is a self-contained vessel of this kind which receives fuel,
the combustion of which therein converts the water contained in
the vessel into steam, for the purpose indicated, and which
vessel, also, necessarily is a part structurally connected with,
and always accompanying, the locomotive which it serves.
(d) TENDER - a vehicle for carrying water and fuel for some
types of steam locomotives. It is coupled to the locomotive,
and is part of it while the locomotive is in service. The
word locomotive is often used to include both the engine and
tender.
(e) ARTICULATED LOCOMOTIVE - a special type of locomotive
having two sets 57 cylinders, driving independent sets of wheels,
which latter support two separate frame units which are flexibly
joined together by hinged, or pivot, joints.
(f) THE LEFT HAND SIDE - of a locomotive is the side on the
left hand of the Driver as he faces the smokebox from the
locomotive cab. Likewise the RIGHT HAND SIDE is that on his
right when so facing.
SECTION 1.
GENERAL DEFINITIONS.


TT
(g) FRONT END - is the end of the locomotive at which the
smokebox is located. A common name for the smokebox and
details contained therein is the "front end".
(h) COUPLED WHEELS - are those wheels which are connected
together by coupling rods, and which transmit the driving force,
primarily imparted to one pair of them, (the driving wheels) to
the rails, and cause the locomotive to move.
(i) BOGIES AND RADIAL TRUCKS (ON LOCOMOTIVES) - carry any small
wheels which assist in guiding the locomotive, but which, in
the case of ordinary steam locomotives, do not take any part in
driving same. They employ four, or two, wheels for each
respective device.
(j) WHEELBASE -
!■ Coupled Wheelbase is the distance between centres
of the leading and trailing coupled wheels.
11. Engine Wheelbase is the distance between the
centre of the front, or leading, axle and the
centre of the rear, or trailing, axle of the
engine.
HI • Total Wheelbase is the distance, with a locomotive
having a tender, between the centre of the front,
or leading, axle on the engine and the rear, or
trailing, axle of the tender.
(k) RATED TRACTIVE EFFORT - is the average force throughout
a revolution exerted by the locomotive driving (and coupled)
wheels at the rails,
(l) ADHESION FACTOR is the total weight on the driving (and
coupled) wheels in lbs. divided by the rated tractive effort in
lbs., and is usually in the vicinity of 4 to 1, to avoid
slipping. A locomotive with an adhesion factor of, say, only
3 to 1, will be very prone to slipping.
(”0 DRAWBAR PULL - is the force which is available for useful
work, and which is applied at the drawbar of the leading vehicle
of the train.
(n) DYNAMOMETER CAR - This is a carriage which is fitted with
a special type of weighing machine, known as a Dynamometer, and
which is used to record the Drawbar Pull exerted by the
locomotive at all points throughout the journey. It may also
be equipped with instruments to record data connected with
running times, speed, brake applications, temperatures, draft.,
etc.
When this vehicle is being used for testing a
locomotive it is always coupled next to the same, and with the
dynamometer end leading.


TTT
(o) COMBUSTION - is the technical term used for describing
the burning process of a fuel. It is the chemical combination
of the Hydrogen and Carbon, and any other combustible components
of the fuel with the oxygen of the air, and results in the
production of heat, and hot gases.
(p) FIRE IRONS - are specially shaped bars of steel, provided
for the use of the Fireman when reconditioning the firebed.
They are made in three types, known as the pricker, dart and
rake.
(q) HEATING SURFACE - is that surface area of the boiler (or
of the boiler and superheater) which is in contact with the
heat and hot gases from the fire.
(r) SATURATED STEAM - is steam in the same condition as
applying when contained in the same vessel as that in which
there is held the body of water from which it is being
generated. This condition can involve different temperatures,
according to any different pressures that might be concerned,
every pressure having a temperature that corresponds, and which
becomes higher as the pressure increases.
(s) SUPERHEATED STEAM - is saturated steam which, after being
generated, and removed from proximity to the body of water from
which it came, has received further heat so as to raise its
temperature above that which applied when in the saturated
condition. This temperature, therefore, although the pressure
of the steam has not changed, is higher than that which
naturally corresponds with the pressure of the steam when
generated.
(t) ROLLING STOCK - is the term used to describe all carriages,
goods vehicles and brake vans of a railway.
(u) RAIL (OR TRACK) GAUGE - is the term applied to the
distance between the inside faces of the rails of a line of
railway and, on the N.S.W.G.R., this is 4'By2 M *
(v) FOUR FOOT - is the term used when referring to the area
within the rail, or track, gauge.
(w) SIX FOOT - is the term used where there are two, or more,
lines of railway, when referring to the area between the two
adjacent rails of any two such lines.
(x) LOAD GAUGE - Measurements that fix the maximum dimensions
for height from rail, and for width, that can be permitted for
locomotives, rolling stock, or loads conveyed.
(y) STRUCTURE GAUGE - measurements that similarly fix the
closest position that can be occupied by any platform, bridge,
tunnel, structure, or other erection placed on, beside, or over
a railway line.

1-1 A. NUMBERING AND CLASSIFICATION OF LOCOMOTIVES,
N.S.ff.G. RAILWAYS.
The class of a locomotive is distinguished by the
first two figures of its number, thus;-
(a) Engine 3643 belongs to the 36 class.
(b) " 5088 " " " 50 class.
(c) " 5707 " " " 57 class.
(d) " 3812 " " " 38 class.
and so on.
When there are more than one hundred locomotives in
any one class the numbers are extended into the next, or two
next, hundreds, for example, in the 50 class the numbers extend
from 5001 to 5280. It is important to note that all
locomotives in the group are referred to as, in this case, the
50 class, and not 51 or 52 class,
B. GROUPING OF LOCOMOTIVE CLASSES.
The locomotive classes are further grouped by adding
a distinguishing letter, as follows
Group (a): Given a distinguishing letter ’X 1 .
This group comprises, crane locomotives, and
some small shunting locomotives.
Group (b); Given a distinguishing letter 'Z*.
This group comprises the old types of
locomotives, not included in group (c)
hereunder, such as the Z. 12, Z. 13, Z. 17,
Z.lB, Z. 19, Z. 20, Z. 24 , Z. 25, Z. 26, Z. 27
classes.
Group (c): Given a distinguishing letter *C', or ’D’, or
*AD'. 'C, being the third letter in the
alphabet, indicates locomotives with three
coupled axles, such as the C. 30, C. 32, C. 35,
C. and C. 38 classes. ’D’, being the fourth
letter in the alphabet, indicates locomotives
with four coupled axles, such as the D. 50,
D. D. 55, D. 57, D. 58 and D. 59 classes.
'A*, placed before the 'D', refers to
articulated locomotives with four coupled
axles in each unit, such as the AD 60 class.


1-1
4 FRONT BUFFER BEAM SYMBOLS.
TZT
Where engine classes have not originally been fitted
with superheaters, or with specially balanced driving wheels,
and where fuel oil burning equipment is used for firing, in
order that locomotives in a class, or a class of locomotives,
subsequently so fitted, may be easily identified, they have
the following symbols painted in white on the front buffer beam:
(a) .j. indicates that this locomotive is now superheated.
(b) X indicates that this locomotive (which is of D. 50,
53 or 55 class) has specially balanced driving wheels,
permitting its maximum speed to be increased to
40 m.p.h.
(c) 0 indicates that this locomotive is fitted with fuel
oil burning equipment.
(d) On AD.6O class buffer beams, indicates that, compared
with other AD.6O class engines, the driving and
coupled wheel axle loads have been increased from
16 to 18 tons each with the cylinder diameter
increased from 19-1/4" to 19-7/8", and Rated Tractive
Effort fixed at 63,000 lb, instead of 56,000 lb.
(e) D.C. On AD.6O class buffer beams, Indicates that the
locomotive is fitted with two sets of driving and
firing controls.

yij Introduction:
This section describes some of those more important
parts of the Steam Locomotive the care and operation of which
will comprise the major portion of a Fireman's duties.
o
■j— 2 The Locomotive Boiler:
By means of the locomotive boiler the chemical energy
contained in the fuel is converted into potential energy, in
the form of the steam generated, and made available for
mechanical work. The boiler is subjected to considerable
stresses, both longitudinally and circumferentially, due to the
steam pressure contained. It also expands, due to temperature,
as steam is raised, and the length of a modern boiler will
increase by 3/8" to 1/2" when fully heated, as compared with
its cold condition.
The locomotive boiler is described technically as an
internally fired, horizontal, fire tube boiler. It may be
equipped, if desired, with arch tubes, thermic syphons, a
combustion chamber, and a superheater, each and all of which
help to increase the efficiency of the boiler, and/or
locomotive,
Locomotive boilers may be distinguished by the shape
of the firebox. Thus, there are:-
(a) "Round top" type fireboxes.
(b) "Belpaire" (or square top) type fireboxes.
(c) Narrow fireboxes (fitting between the main
frames of the locomotive).
(d) Wide fireboxes (spreading out wider than
the main frames of the locomotive).
Figures (1-2-1) and (1-2-2) show a sectional elevation
of the C. 36 class "Belpaire", narrow firebox type boiler,
whilst Figures (1-2-3) and (1-2-4) show the "Round top", wide
firebox type boiler fitted to AD.6O class locomotives. Both
these boilers are designed to have superheaters.

The external shell of the boiler consists of the barrel,
and outer firebox casing plate. There is also the front tube
plate, the firebox back casing plate, and the throat plate.
A vertical, more or less cylindrical container known as
the "dome" is placed on top of the barrel to provide a
receptacle, as remote as possible from the surface of the water,
for collecting the steam.
The internal parts of the boiler consist of -
(1) The firebox, which is made up of the firebox tubeplate,
firebox backplate, and internal firebox wrapper plate.
It is attached to the outer firebox casing, and to the
throat and back casing plates by the foundation ring at
the bottom, and by crown stays the top, and wall stays
at the sides and likewise at the lower part of the
tubeplate, and at the backplate.
(2) The front (or smokebox) tubeplate is attached either
directly by its own flange to the barrel, or to a tubeplate
angle ring placed around the barrel.
(3) The small tubes and (in the case of boilers designed for
superheating) superheater flue tubes connect the two
tubeplates, and provide passages for the flow of hot gases
between them.
(4) The areas at the top of the front tubeplate and firebox
back casing plate are supported by longitudinal stays,
while the sides of the firebox casing plate, above the
firebox, are tied together with transverse stays.
The locomotive boiler is securely fixed to the main
frame of the locomotive at the front end by bolting or rivetting
the smokebox to the frame, or to a saddle casting attached to
the latter, and, at the rear end, it is supported on expansion
brackets which permit it to expand longitudinally under varying
conditions of temperature.

The crown stays are of special construction, being
usually so formed as to screw into both the internal firebox
wrapper and outer firebox casing plates. The first two or
three rows nearest the firebox tubeplate are arranged to allow
for the movement, due to the difference in expansion, that
takes place between the firebox tubeplate, and the front part
of the firebox wrapper plate, on the one hand, and the outer
casing plate, on the other.


TT?
4 Wall Stays.
Wall stays are of copper, or steel, and- are used for
staying the sides, back, and front of the firebox to,
respectively, the outer casing plate, the back casing plate,
and the throat plate.
Since stay breakages can be a serious matter, each
stay has a tell-tale hole drilled in each end so that a broken
stay may readily be discovered by the steam blowing through it
Figure (1-2-5) is a diagram of a wall stay in position.
Wall Stay.
Figure 5/1-2


T=2
It is essential that the wall and crown stays be
examined at every opportunity, because if one stay should be
broken the pressure on the plates which the broken stay was
supporting will have to be taken by the other stays next to it,
with the possibility of these stays also breaking under the
additional load, while the plates where the broken stay is
located will be unsupported, and might bulge.
5
j Tubes,
With all copper fireboxes, copper tubes are used for
the small boiler tubes, and for the large flue tubes which
contain the superheater elements.
At the firebox end the tubes and flues are expanded in
the firebox tubeplate, and beaded over. At the smokebox end
they project beyond the smokebox tubeplate for future tube
driving, and are merely expanded into this tubeplate.
With composite, or all steel fireboxes, steel tubes and
flues are used, and these are expanded, and also beaded over at
the smokebox tubeplate. At the firebox tubeplate these tubes
are expanded, prossered, and finally the bead is electrically
welded to the tubeplate.
0
The Dome.
The dome, as has already been stated, is for the purpose
of providing a space, as high as practicable above the water,
for collecting the steam with as little moisture contained as
possible. On the majority of locomotive classes the regulator
is placed in the dome, but with others it is placed in the
smokebox, and a steam dryer is provided in the dome. The dome
also contains the internal steam pipes which lead from it to
supply dry steam to the Westinghouse air compressor, blower,
injectors, stoker engine, and any other auxiliaries requiring
same.

TZ2 The Brick Arch.
A brick arch is provided inside the firebox, immediately
underneath the bottom row of tubes, and from the firebox
tubeplate it extends back, and diagonally upwards (as viewed
from the side of the engine) towards the firehole door.
Transversely it is commonly built in the form of an
arch, so as to be self-supporting, being sprung from side to
side of the firebox, with the side footings resting on brackets,
or studs, so that the sides of the box act as abutments for
support. In some cases, however, the arch is formed differently
being partly carried by arch tubes, or thermic syphons, as shown
in Figure (1-2-6)


T=2
AD 60 Class Locomotive Brick Arch.
Figure 6/1-2


T-2
The brick arch acts as a baffle, and has a very
important duty to perform, particularly with regard to the
prevention of smoke, and the proper combining of the volatile
combustible gases given off from the fuel. The advantages of
using a brick arch are:-
(a) By lengthening the path of the gases to the tubes and flues
these are retained for a greater interval of time in the
firebox, and, therefore, have more time in which to mix
with the air, be heated, and burn.
(b) The arch becomes intensely hot, and thus helps to prevent
the gases being cooled below their ignition temperature,
should the inside of the firebox suffer a sudden temporary
reduction in temperature, as when a heavy charge of coal
is put on.
(c) It assists to prevent fine particles of fuel from being
drawn through the tubes without burning.
(d) It protects the tubes from the cold draught of air that is
drawn in when the firedoor is opened, or that enters when
the fire is knocked out, and also prevents too rapid a
cooling of the firebox plates under the latter condition,
these all being factors which might cause damage by sudden
and uneven contraction.
The brick arch, therefore, assists combustion, helps to
prevent smoke, protects the boiler, and effects a saving of fuel.
g
Boiler Water Circulation.
The evaporative heating surface of a locomotive boiler
comprises that of the inner firebox, the tubes and flues. Of
these surfaces the crown sheet is the most effective, the
tubeplate, sides and back of the firebox next, after which come
the tube and flue surfaces, with that part of these latter which
is nearest to the firebox conveying much more heat than the
corresponding area nearer to the smokebox.
As the boiler is heated the water in it begins to
circulate, this being caused by the water next to the firebox
plates becoming heated, and rising, due to hot water being
lighter than cold water, volume for volume. Currents are then
started in the direction of the heated water which has been
displaced, and these are strongest where most of the heating is
taking place, which is on the firebox crown.
When the boiler becomes hot enough steam is formed on
the various heating surfaces, and rises very rapidly through t
water above it, to be released to the steam space, so that th
circulation of water becomes more rapid as the rate of
evaporation increases. This movement of the water in the
boiler from the colder zones to the hotter ones aids the heating


T-Z
of the water, which is thus accomplished by what is known as
convection, and the currents formed are called convection
currents. Thus, the rapid circulation of the water in a boiler
is- a very important consideration in providing for the production
of a large quantity of steam quickly, and efficiently.
9
YZ2 Arch Tubes and Thermic Syphons.
In some types of locomotive boilers the firebox heating
surface, where the highest temperatures are available, has been
augmented, and steps taken to increase the rate of circulation
of the water in that area. This has been done by providing
more heating surface in the form of arch tubes, and/or thermic
syphons, which also supply special channels through which, under
the action of the heat applied, the water can be made strongly
to flow.
Figure (1-2-7)shows the construction of a thermic syphon,
while Figure (1-2-8) is a view of a large American locomotive
with syphons fitted in the combustion chamber, as well as in the
firebox itself, and this diagram clearly illustrates the
circulation of the water created by the syphons.
Fusible Plugs.
The temperature attained by the hot gases in the firebox
of a locomotive can be as much as 2,500° F. though, on the other
side of the firebox plates, the temperature of the water is very
much less. Actually, with steam at 200 lb pressure per square
inch, the temperature of the water and steam in the boiler is
only about 375° F,
It may be asked why, with this high temperature in the
firebox, the plates do not melt, or burn away. The answer is
that the transfer of heat through the plates is at such a rapid
rate that, so long as there is water in contact with them, and
they are reasonably clean of scale, or other deposits on the
water side which might interfere with heat transfer, they are
kept cool, and cannot become over-heated. If, however, the
water be allowed to fall below the firebox crown, and this for
a brief period only, the crown plate will then become seriously
overheated, with the possibility of it's collapse, and an
explosion resulting, possibly with fatal results to those nearby.
To obviate this risk one, or more, fusible plugs, as
shown in Figure (1-2-9), are fitted into bushes which are screwed
into the crown sheet of the firebox, and if at any time the
temperature of the plate rises above that at which the fusible
metal in the plug melts, this latter action takes place, thus
allowing steam and water to be ejected into the firebox, and so
damp out the fire.

Fire Grates.
(a) Generally.
The bottom of the firebox is formed by the firegrate,
which is made with bars, or other devices of suitable shape,
to carry the fuel, and admit the air necessary for the burning
of same. There are at present three types of grates in service,
the straight bar type (this, also, being a fixed grate) which
is fitted to some of the older types of locomotives, and the
"Rosebud" and "Waugh Firebar" types (which are rocking and
dumping grates). In all types the grates are arranged longi-
tudinally either in a horizontal position, or to slope downwards
towards the front tubeplate, or else to have part of the grate
at the rear horizontal and part at the front sloping. The
purpose of sloping the grate is partly to obtain a sufficient
depth to accommodate the fire under the brick arch, and partly
to assist the fuel gradually to work forward (aided by the
vibration of the locomotive, when moving) thereby reducing the
physical labour of the Fireman, who has to throw a less quantity
of coal than would otherwise be the case to the front extremity
of the grate.
With all firegrates the area allowed for the flow of air
through them to the fire is important, and the total area thus
provided is stated as a percentage of the whole grate area.
Thus, if the total area, of all air holes and spaces in the
grates provided for air entry is 15 square feet, on a locomotive
having a total grate area of 50 square feet, the grate concerned
is a 30% air opening grate.
(b) Straight Bars.
In most cases where locomotives are fitted with straight
bars two separate bars are used to make up the full length of
the grate. The bars are placed side by side, and lengthways
with the firebox, the ends being supported by bearer bars fixed
across the firebox. The firebars themselves are tapered, being
wider at the top edges than at the bottom, in order to allow the
ashes to pass freely through to the ash pan underneath.
(c) Rocking Grates.
1. "Rosebud" types: Figure (1-2-10 )shows the "Rosebud" type
fire grate. This grate is of the table type, and is
cast in sections. In narrow firebox boilers each
section is of a size a little less than equal to the
full width of the firebox, and each measures, lengthwise
with the firebox approximately 12 inches. On each
side of the firebox there are side bearers, which are
provided with trunion bearings, on which the required
number of grate sections to make up the full length of
the fire grate are carried. With wide firebox boilers
the grate sections are cast to equal approximately half


T=2
"Rosebud" Firegrate

T=2
the width of the grate, and a centre bearer is then
provided in addition.
11. "Waugh" Type; The "Waugh" type of firegrate is iflade
up of units, as shown in Figure (1-2-11, )which are
entered upon a carrier bar, Figure (1-2-12) through a
groove in either end. The flange on the bar locks
the units in place, and prevents them from becoming
detached. There is just enough play to permit the
units to move a little with the motion of the
locomotive, the idea being to have an automatic
vibrating action. Figure (1-2-13 )shows a partially
assembled grate. It is also claimed that these bars
increase the coal burning efficiency due to the
channeled design of the unit surface, which is intended
to permit a flow of air between the top surface of the
bars and the under side of the fire bed.

Fire Grate Rocking Mechanism.
Rocking mechanism is provided for the dual purpose of
shaking the fire so as to open the firebed up, if necessary, or
to remove excess ash, thus largely superseding the use of fire
irons for this purpose, and for reconditioning (or knocking out)
the fire by dumping ashes, clinker, or excess unburned coal in
the firebox into the ashpan.
To lessen the effort required to operate the rocking
grates they are divided into 2,3, or 4 groups, depending on the
total area of the firegrate, the grates in each group being
joined together by coupling rods, and connected by a connecting
rod to individual rocking levers in the cab. Each lever is
fitted with a locking device to prevent movement when (as
mostly) this is not desired. There is also a stirrup link
which, when in the normal position, and with the rocking lever
locking device released, permits only a limited movement of the
grates, this being sufficient under average conditions to free
and liven up the fire. When the stirrup is lowered, or raised
(as the case might be) the grates can be moved into the almost
vertical, or fire dumping, position. Figure (1-2-14)
Illustrates diagrammatically the rocking grate and ashpan.

■j~2 Ash Pan.
To prevent ashes, and any live pieces of coal that may
pass through the firegrate from falling to the ground when
running, and thereby creating a fire risk, an ashpan is provided
to hold them until the locomotive reaches a station, or depot,
where de-ashing pits are provided. The ashpan also serves the
purpose of controlling and directing, to the underside of the
fire in the firebox, that in-flow of air that is required for
combustion.
Generally speaking ashpans are divided into two types:-
(a) Flat Type Ashpans. This is simply a rectangular box
arrangement attached beneath the firebox. It is provided with
a hinged door (or cage) at either one, or both ends, depending
on the class of locomotive. To clean this type of ashpan the
door has to be swung clear, and the ashes then raked out through
the end opening.
(b) Hopper Type Ashpan. This type (which is also shown in
Figure 1-2-14) as its name implies is fitted with one, or more,
hoppers to hold the ashes, and any live coal passing through the
firegrates.
To empty this type of ashpan a door, or doors, are
provided at the bottom of the hoppers which, when opened, allow
the ashes to fall out by gravity, being assisted by flushing
away, either by the injector flushing system, or by a separate
cold water hose from the ash pit used for the purpose.
14
Safety Valves.
These valves, as their name implies, are a safety
device provided to prevent the steam pressure rising above that
intended for the boiler concerned, and to such an extent as
might cause damage, or involve the risk of an explosion.
(a) Ramsbottom Type Safety Valves. (Figure 1-2-15), these
valves are fixed on to the top of the firebox casing plate, and
consist of two stands, or pillars, (2) each fitted with a bronze
seating (3) upon which rests a circular valve, (4) about
3*/z inches in diameter. There are coned recesses on top of each
valve into which fit the pivots of the overhead lever, (5),
which latter is held down against the pressure of the steam
acting under each valve by a spring, (6), one end of which is
attached to the firebox casing, and the other to the overhead
lever. The long end of the lever is for the purpose of
enabling the englnemen to set the valves in motion in the
unlikely event of one of them sticking.
The valves are adjusted to the desired blowing off
pressure by means of the nuts being tightened down on to the


T=2
Ramsbottom type Safety Valve
Figure 15/1-2
washers, (7), placed under the eye bolt bracket, (8), which
latter thus tensions the spring. After a period in service
the springs, being constantly extended, and subject to heat,
will sometimes gradually weaken, and the valves in consequence
then blow off before the working pressure is reached. When
this takes place they should be booked for attention by the
Driver, and it is then necessary to reduce the thickness of the
washers under the eye bolt bracket, so that the nuts may be
screwed down more. As it is necessary partly to dismantle the
valves to do this, they can only be adjusted when there is no
steam in the boiler.


T=2
(b) Pop Safety Valves; This type of safety valve is now
very largely adopted for use on locomotive boilers. It has a
large steam discharge capacity, prompt opening, and closing,
with small overhead height, and may be adjusted while the boiler
is in steam. Figure 1-2-16 illustrates the Ashton muffled pop
safety valve as fitted to the C. 38 class locomotives.
The adjustment of the blowing off pressure is made by
screwing down the pressure screw, (6), which is then locked in
position by check nut, (5), and sealed. On the steam reaching
the pressure at which the valve (16) is set the latter lifts
off its seat, the steam then gets under the valve lip, (13),
thereby having access to the much greater area that consequently
becomes exposed to its pressure, so instantly increasing the
lift, and allowing the steam to escape very freely. As the
steam pressure in the boiler, is reduced, and the valve begins to
return to its seat, the lip, (13), on the valve directs the
steam into the cavity, (15), in the base (1), from which it is
allowed to escape through the holes, (14), which are drilled
around the base to provide for this discharge to take place at
a suitable rate, so that the force with which the valve will
seat can be controlled.
To protect the valve and valve seat from damage due to
too sudden a closure when the valve seats, two regulators, (7),
are provided which, when screwed down, interfere with the
discharge of the steam through two of the holes, (14), around
the base, thereby permitting of adjustment in control so that
the fina.l seating action does not take place with too great a
Jar. The reseating pressure or, as it is more commonly known,
the "blow back", should be set at approximately 3 lb per square
inch below the boiler pressure.
Should it be found that a pop valve blows back 5 lb per
square inch, or more, below the proper blowing off pressure, the
Driver should book the valve for attention, as the cavity, (15),
is probably becoming blocked with sediment, etc.,
(c) Safety Valve Pressure Settings: The following table

YZ2 Boiler Water Gauges and Test Cocks.
In order to provide the Driver and Fireman of a loco-
motive with a visual indication of the level of the water in
the boiler at all times, each boiler is fitted with two water
gauge glasses, or else with one water gauge glass and a set of
test cocks.
(a) Test Cocks.
The test cocks are provided so that, should the water
gauge glass burst, or become defective, the test cocks can be
opened to ascertain the water level in the boiler. This latter
is determined approximately by the discharge of either water,
or steam, from the drip pipes attached to the test cocks, when
the latter are opened a little. The difference between water
and steam, however, can only be determined by looking, and
seeing what comes out of the drip pipes. Never trust to sound.
(b) Water Gauges.
Figure (1-2-17 )shows the construction of a typical boiler
water gauge. It consists simply of a glass tube (8) fixed on
the back casing plate of the boiler, the top end being connected


T=2
to the steam space of the boiler through the pipe (2) and the
bottom end to the water space through the opening in the bottom
boiler mounting (18) and thus the level of the water in the
boiler is shown by the height of the water column in the glass
tube.
The ball valves (6) and (15) are provided to prevent the
water from escaping and scalding the locomotive crew should a
glass tube break. The sudden rush of steam and water through
the passages, when a gauge glass breaks, forces the ball valves
on to a seat in each passage leading to the glass tube, thus
automatically cutting off the flow of steam and water into the
cab.
A plug type drain valve (17) is provided which must be
opened for a few seconds at regular intervals, when the boiler
is in steam, (or whenever there is any doubt that the gauge is
showing the water level correctly) to clear any sludge that may
have settled in the passage ways. At the same time the top
ball valve lever (3) must be held down to prevent the top ball
valve from seating, otherwise only the bottom passage will be
cleaned out.
The water container (10) is added as a means of checking
the oscillations of the water in the gauge glass, due to move-
ment of the locomotive, by providing a steadying mass of water
close to the gauge glass. At the same time it makes the various
parts of the gauge into a single, rigid unit.
Stop valves (7) and (14) are connected by a coupling rod
(9) so that they may be operated together from a single handle
and, when any work is to be carried out on the gauge glass, they
must be closed, and the drain valve (17) opened, so that there
will be no steam pressure inside the gauge glass.
The screwed plugs (4) (5) and (16) may be removed to
allow the passage ways to be rodded out, should a stubborn block-
age occur in any of them. The top plug (5) also allows access
to the top ball valve (6) should this valve become stuck on its
seat after a blowing out operation. The bottom plug (16) is
fitted with a small tray to prevent the bottom ball valve (15)
being drawn into the drain valve (17) during a blowing out
operation.
It is important to note that the position of the bottom
gland nut (11) fixes the minimum safe margin for the depth of
the water over the crown of the firebox wrapper plate when the
locomotive is on a level track. The position of the bottom
boiler mounting itself has no relation whatsoever to the safe
water level and, in fact, is usually well below this level.
A description of the testing of the water gauge will be
given in the section dealing with the preparation of the loco-
motive for service.

YZ2 Pressure Gauge.
Pressure gauges for the boilers of steam locomotives
are of the "Bourdon" type. The action depends on the tendency
which a partially flattened copper tube (known as the Bourdon
tube) has, if bent to form a curve, to straighten itself out
when subjected to internal pressure.


1-2
Pressure Gauge,
Figure 18/1-2
In Figure 1-2-18 are shown the working parts of a steam
pressure gauge, in which (3) is a flattened tube, of hard drawn
copper, secured to a centre casting, (6), which has passages in
it forming the inlet for pressure to the tube. The free end of
the tube is closed, and is connected by means of a short link,
(1), to a small toothed sector, (2). The sector gears with a
pinion on the spindle, (5), carrying the outside pointer (8),
while a small hair spring, (4), is fitted to take out the back
lash between the sector and pinion. The whole of the mechanism
is carried by the centre casting, (6), which is attached to the
outer casing, (7).


T=2
It is a bad practice to allow steam into the Bourdon
tube, as the high temperature involved is liable to cause injury,
and false readings. Steam gauges, therefore, should be
Insulated from the direct action of the steam by interposing a
water column. This is done by providing a syphon pipe to
retain such a water column, formed by condensed steam, and this
syphon, in its simplest form, is made by bending the copper tube
connecting the gauge to the boiler in the form of a 'U’ tube, or
by coiling the tube around the outside of the gauge itself.
The pipe connecting each pressure gauge to the boiler is also
fitted with an isolating valve, which may be turned off should
the Bourdon tube, or pipe leading to the gauge, burst.
It will frequently be found that the registered boiler
pressure, as shown by the tablet in the cab, is not shown by the
gauge. In such cases the pressure should be tested with the
standard gauge kept in each Depot, so that it can be ascertained
whether the locomotive gauge is registering correctly, or
whether the safety valves require adjusting.
17
Injectors.
(a) General.
Among the various auxiliary fittings on the locomotive a
very important place is filled by the equipment provided for the
supply of feed water to the boiler. In the early days of steam
locomotives pumps were employed for the purpose but, after the
invention of the "Giffard" steam injector, pumps were discarded,
except where heated feed water had to be dealt with.
There are many different types of injectors in use on
steam locomotives throughout the world, but the live steam, non-
lifting, injector is the type which is used on these Railways.
Figure (1-2-19) shows the Gresham and Craven sliding cone
injector which is fitted to many types of locomotives, and Figure
(1-2-20) shows the Nathan injector fitted to a number of others.
(b) Working Principle.
The fundamental principle of the action of the injector
is found in the fact that steam, when released under pressure in
the form of a jet, travels at a much greater speed than does
water under the same conditions, and when steam is applied
through a nozzle to a body of water the resultant mixture,
travelling practically at the rate of steam, if directed through
a delivery cone (which, further, is so formed that in the final
stage expansion will occur) can have the momentum acquired
converted into a pressure which will be greater than that of the
original steam supplied from the boiler to provide the jet.
This water pressure, therefore, being rendered greater than that
of the steam in the boiler, will overcome the resistance of the
latter, and the water thereby gain access to the boiler, and so
provide a supply to same. This supply will also have been


T=2
heated by the steam as it passed through the injector, so that
the water entering thus will have a temperature of some 140 to
160° F.
(c) Gresham and Craven Injector.
The Gresham and Craven Injector, as shown in
Figure 1-2-19, is of the non-lifting, sliding cone type, and
operates in the following manner.
Water from the tender tank enters the injector, and
flows into the chamber around the steam cone (4) and along the
combining cone (3). The water then forces the sliding cone (2)
to the left, and escapes through the overflow chamber, thus
ensuring that there is no build up of pressure inside the
injector. When the steam is turned on it enters the injector
through the steam cone (4). This cone is shaped so that the
steam issuing from the end of it will do so at a very high
velocity. The jet of steam then passes into the combining
cone (3) where, meeting the water, it is condensed, at the same
time drawing the water along with it. The resultant jet then
moves through the sliding cone (2) into the converging portion
of the delivery cone (5) and at the smallest cross section of
this cone the jet is moving with its highest velocity. The
energy possessed by the jet of water due to its momentum is then
converted into pressure energy in its passage along the
divergent portion of the delivery cone (5), the pressure
increasing as the velocity decreases and, on leaving the delivery
cone, the pressure is greater than the boiler pressure. Thus
the feed water is able to lift the boiler clack valve and enter
the boiler.
As the jet begins to feed the boiler in the way
described a vacuum is created in the passage between the cones
leading to the overflow chamber, and the sliding cone (2) then
automatically moves to the right until it seats against the end
of the combining cone. Should anything happen to destroy this
vacuum, such as a sudden interruption to the water supply, which
may be caused by the movement of the locomotive, the sliding
cone will again move to the left to allow the pressure then
formed to escape, when, normally, the injector will automati-
cally start to feed again, and the sliding cone return to its
previous position.
(d) Nathan Injector.
The Nathan injector, shown in Figure (1-2-20) operates
on the same principle as the Gresham and Craven injector, with
the exception that the sliding cone is replaced by a hinged
overflow valve (19), and, in addition, there is a series of
slots provided in the length of the combining cone (5) and (6)
which supplement the action of the overflow valve in discharging
any steam and water pressure that may build up in this cone.


TT2
Gresham and Craven Injector.
Figure 19/1-2


Nathan Injector,
Figure 20/1-2
An additional feature of this injector is the jet nozzle
(4) which automatically regulates the quantity of water entering
the combining cone (5). As the boiler pressure varies so also
does the quantity of steam entering the steam cone (3) and jet
nozzle (4), and, as the quantity of water entering the combining
cone is governed by the quantity of steam entering the jet
nozzle, a means has been provided whereby the amount of water
supplied to the injector is automatically regulated, and the
injector can not, therefore, be oversupplied with water.
The injector is also fitted with its own water valve
(14) and check valves (20) and (23) on the delivery and overflow
pipes, thereby making a neat and compact unit.

(e) Possible Causes of Injector Failures.
The causes of injector failures as a rule are not far
to seek, and may generally be looked for among the following:-
1. If the strainers become blocked with foreign matter it
will prevent the full supply of water entering the injector,
with the result that the steam will not be properly
condensed. An indication of this will be given by a broken
jet of steam and water escaping at the overflow.
2. If either the steam valve, or the clack valve is blowing
back the injector will become hot, and the steam jet again
will not condense properly.
3. Should the temperature of the feed water rise above 120° F.,
the injector will fail to work, due likewise to the steam
jet not condensing properly.
4. Loose, damaged, or scaled cones will also cause the
injector to fail.
(f) Arrangement of the Injector and Piping.
Figure (1-2-21)shows a typical arrangement of the injector
and piping on a locomotive. The cold water in the tender tank
passes through the tender tank strainer, (18), into the tender
water pipe, (17), then through the tender water valve, (16),
strum box strainer, (15), and hose bag, (14), to the engine
water valve, (3), and thence into the injector, (12). The
steam, which is collected in the dome of the boiler,and passes
through an internal steam pipe (see 11, Figure 1-2-1) to the
steam turret, (7), is then admitted to the injector by the
injector steam pipe, (8), and injector starting valve, (9).
From the injector the water is delivered through the injector
delivery pipe, (11), in which the pressure of the water is
greater than that of the steam pressure in the boiler, so that
it lifts the clack valve, (10), and commences to feed the boiler.
On the delivery pipe, just in front of the cab, a branch
pipe is connected,to which the hot water hose, (5), and the ash
pan flushers, (4), if fitted, are attached. It should be
remembered that at all times while the injector is working the
full pressure is being delivered to these valves, and it is,
therefore, necessary to see that the stop valves are firmly
closed before the injector is started.
18
The Smoke box, and Internal Details of Same.
The smokebox of a locomotive, and apparatus contained
therein, provides the draft producing system which is needed to
induce the flow of air at high velocity through the fire to
maintain that rapid combustion of the fuel in the firebox which


T=2

Figure 21/1-2


T=2
is an essential requirement for the operation of a steam
locomotive.
Two types of smokeboxes are in use on this railway
system. There is the older arrangement, known as the non-self-
cleaning type, shown in Figure (1-2-22 ) and the later design,
which provides a self-cleaning feature, seen in Figure (1-2-230
(a) Smokebox Shell.
This is of steel plate, bent to form a drum, which is
rivetted to the front tube plate of the boiler, and it is also
attached, either direct to the main frame of the locomotive,
or else to a saddle casting which forms part of the main frame,
and thus provides the means for the securing of the boiler at
the front end to the locomotive framework. A large door is
fitted to the front of the smokebox, and every precaution is
taken to exclude the possibility of outside air entering, the
only means of access allowed being through the tubes and flues
of the boiler, and the opening of the chimney.
(b) Blast Pipe.
This pipe directs the exhaust steam from the cylinders
centrally into the petticoat and chimney.
(c) Blast Pipe, Petticoat and Chimney.
These three parts together provide passages by the first
for the escape of the exhaust steam, and by the second and third
for that of the exhaust steam and the gases from the fire, to
atmosphere. They are designed in such a manner that the jet of
exhaust steam discharged from the blast pipe, passing through
the petticoat and chimney, and filling the latter a short
distance from the top of same, will eject the gases of combustion,
which become mixed with it, from within the smokebox shell,
thereby creating a partial vacuum inside the smokebox. The
atmospheric pressure outside, then being much higher, (and the
only means of communication with the smokebox available being
through the firegrate) will cause air to flow at high velocity
through the firebed thereon, whereupon the gases of combustion
formed, after leaving the fire, will pass through the tubes and
flues into the smokebox, where they will be caught up by, and
expelled along with, the exhaust steam jet in the way just
described. There will thus be maintained a constant and
adequate supply of air to promote the fierce combustion of the
fire that is necessary when the engine is steaming. Figure
(L-2-24) is a diagram showing this cycle of events.
(d) The Blower provides a jet of live steam direct from the
boiler that serves, in the place of the exhaust steam, to create
the necessary partial vacuum to maintain combustion, and a
bright fire, when the engine is not steaming. A much less
vacuum than that which the exhaust steam is capable of generating
is necessary in this case. The design of Blower varies, but a

common type is a ring surrounding the top of the blast nozzle
with a number of small circular holes on top from which the live
steam escapes to the chimney.
(e) Spark Arresters.
These are fitted, as shown in Figures Nos. 1-2-22 and
1-2-23, and are formed of wire mesh which provides slightly
smaller than J" square holes. They are required to prevent any
cinders in a dangerously live condition being ejected from the
smokebox, thus obviating the possibility of starting fires
adjacent to the running lines.
(f) Draft, or Apron Plate etc.
The draft, or apron plate, the diaphragm plates, and
table plate of the self-cleaning smokebox (Figures Nos. 1-2-23
and 1-2-24) are plates provided to direct the passage and, when
the draft, or apron plate is reached, to increase the velocity
of the gases passing through the smokebox, in order that the
cinders will be broken up first, and ultimately ejected, thereby
maintaining the smokebox free of an accumulation of cinders.
19
Lubricators..
(a) Purpose of:-
Lubricators are required on steam locomotives to provide
a means by which oil can be supplied to those moving parts of
the locomotive that are subjected to the pressure of the steam
from the boiler, such as the cylinders, valve chambers, etc.
There are several types of lubricators in use, and these
are as follows:-
(b) Hydrostatic Lubricators.
Figure 1-2-25 is an illustration of a hydrostatic
lubricator, and is the type fitted to most of the classes of
locomotives in service, the figure showing a hydrostatic
lubricator of the Detroit make.
The operating principle of the hydrostatic lubricator is
that arrangement is made to balance (or overcome) the pressure
due to steam in the valve chests and cylinders of the locomotive
by boiler steam admitted direct to the lubricator, which steam,
also, by partially condensing in the lubricator, provides a
column of water therein which, by the weight of it, will provide
an unbalanced pressure on the oil in the oil reservoir of same
(A, in the Figure). By means of this hydrostatic (or water
column) pressure oil will flow from the lubricator to the valves
and pistons of the locomotive, notwithstanding the steam
pressure at these latter points, and each drop of oi}. thus

leaving the lubricator will be replaced by water, due to
further condensation occurring.
In order to make this principle work well the lubricator
is placed as high as possible in the cab of the locomotive.
The size of the lubricators vary with the number of
points that have to be oiled under steam pressure on the various
classes of locomotives.

T-2
(c) Mechanical Lubricators.
With the mechanical lubricator (Figure 1-2-26) a pump is
used to force the oil to terminal check valves, whence it is
delivered to the valves and pistons of the locomotive by a supply
of steam obtained from the boiler.
Inside the lubricator there are several pump units, which
vary in number, according to how many points are to be mechani-
cally lubricated on the various classes of locomotives.
The pump assembly of the unit is operated by a ratchet
lever that can be attached to any convenient part of the motion
gear of the locomotive, and that will give impulses to the pumps
as the locomotive wheels revolve.
Some classes of locomotives are fitted with two
mechanical lubricators, one for the purpose described, and the
other to provide lubrication to the axle box horn cheeks.
However, in the latter case the oil is delivered direct to the
parts concerned under the action of the pump, and without the
aid of any steam.

TT2
Mechanical lubricators consisting of a single pump unit
are also fitted to the cross compound air compressor, and the
mechanical stoker engine, on some classes of locomotives.
(Filling, etc. of lubricator will be dealt with in Section 3,
following, which sets out the duties of the Fireman during the
preparation of the locomotive.)
Trimmings.
(a) Purpose of:-
Many bearings of the locomotive, due to their position
and movement, are difficult to lubricate, and it is necessary to
have an oil well attached to (or near) the part.
To regulate the supply of oil from the well to the
bearing in some cases a trimming is used.
These trimmings consist of strands of worsted wound
around, or attached to, a piece of wire, and they take two
different forms.
(b) Plug Trimmings.
These trimmings are used for those parts that have
sufficient rotary, or reciprocating motion to throw the oil over
the top of the pipe (syphon pipe) leading from the oil well to
the bearing.
Such trimmings are made by wrapping strands of worsted
lengthwise over a stem of twisted trimming wire in such a way as
to form a plug. This plug is inserted in the syphon pipe so
that the bottom end is clear of the lower outlet, and the top
end is a little below the top of the syphon pipe. This
regulates the flow of oil from the oil well (which is closed)
when, by movement, it is thrown about, and some enters the
syphon pipe, and seeps through the worsted of the trimming,
(c) Tail Trimmings.
These trimmings are used on parts that have virtually
no revolving or reciprocating motion, and that require the oil
to be conveyed from the oil well into the syphon pipe only by
the capillary and syphoning action of the trimming. They are
made by taking several strands of worsted, and attaching them
in a loop formed at one end of a length of twisted wire. The
other end has a larger loop through which the strands are
loosely passed, and which also serves to prevent the trimming
entering too far into the syphon pipe. The trimming, when in
use, is inserted in the syphon pipe, the end entered therein
being pushed down to be below the bottom of the oil well (but
clear of the lower outlet) and the tail ends of the worsted
allowed to hang over into the oil in the oil well. The oil
creeps up the loose strands, and down into the syphon pipe, and


T=2
thus keeps on slowly feeding drops of oil to the bearing. The
greater the number of loose strands the greater will be the oil
supply, provided they do not too closely fill, and crowd together
in, the syphon pipe.
21
13J Pin Feeds.
With some rotating parts, i.e. side rods and big ends,
the syphon pipe in the oil well, instead of a plug trimming,
contains a loose pin of definite size, which works in a guide
hole of a slightly larger diameter drilled in a fitting which is
located on top of the syphon pipe. This pin pulsates up and
down with the movement of the part concerned, while the oil in
the well is also splashed on to the top of the pin(which is formed
of a short portion bent at right angles to the rest) and the
pumping action engendered by the movement of the latter in the
closely fitting hole into which it fits causes a quantity of oil,
so loiig as the locomotive is moving, to be fed to the bearing.
22
Electric Lighting.
Electric light is provided on steam locomotives by means
of a steam turbine which is directly coupled to an electric
generator, the whole unit usually being referred to as the
turbo-generator.
The turbo-generator is operated by a steam stop valve
located in the cab of the locomotive, and placed on the boiler
directly above the fire hole door, and supplies current for the
headlight, marker lights, cab lights and, where fitted, the
tender lights, injector overflow lights and motion lights.
A switch is provided in the cab for the headlight, and
this has three positions - Off, Dim, and Full - while the marker
lights have individual built-in switches on each light housing.
All the other lights are usually controlled directly by the
turbo-generator, without any intervening switches.

T=s
-jig- Introduction.
This section gives a detailed description of the duties
of a Fireman, from the time he signs on duty to the time he
couples the locomotive to the train.
For a Fireman to carry out his duties satisfactorily
prior to, and during, his preparation of the locomotive it is
advisable to work to a plan. The order in which to proceed
with his duties, as set out in the following pages, will be a
guide for the Trainee Engineman, to help him carry out his work
in a systematic manner.
-J§g- Signing On.
The first duty of all staff when attending for work is
to sign on at the appointed place, and punctually to the time
rostered.
A Fireman coming on duty at a Locomotive Depot is
required to report to the Booker-On, or Roster Clerk, as the
case might be, who will enter the Fireman's name, and the sign-
on time, on the Driver's sheet. The fireman should then obtain
the following information:- viz. Driver's name, train number,
and engine number, and he should also peruse, and sign, any
General Orders and/or Speed Notices.
3
Collecting Engine Kit.
The Fireman will then obtain the kit from the Store, or
locker, and check it over prior to taking it to the engine.
The standard kit equipment for all classes of
locomotives, excluding C. 38, D. 57, D. 59 and AD.6O classes, shall
be as per list (a) hereunder:-

Disposing the Kit for use.
(a) To meet the Driver’s Requirements.
Place on the front buffer beam, for the Driver's use,
the following items;- one square can of Loco. Bearing Oil,
one flare lamp ready for use, one lid lifter, one coal pick,
and one oil feeder with a small piece of cotton waste placed
in the handle of the feeder.
(b) For the Fireman's Own Requirements.
Place the remainder of the kit in the engine cab, and
prepare the second oil feeder and flare lamp for own use.


T=3
Examination of Boiler Water Gauges.
(a) Water Gauge Protectors.
Before attempting to test the water gauges, note that
the gauge glass protectors are in position. Should they be
defective, or missing, notify the Driver immediately, who
must report the defect to the Chargeman, or other responsible
Officer at the time on duty.
(b) Testing Boiler Water Gauges.
To test the gauges open the gauge glass drain valve,
(17), Figure 1-2-17 for a few seconds, so as to clear away any
scale, or sludge, that may be deposited in the passage ways.
Then close, and when the movement of water has stopped, note
the water level. Next, hold down the top ball valve lever,(3),
and again open the gauge glass drain valve for a few seconds,
and note, when the ball valve lever is released, and the drain
valve subsequently closed, that the water returns rapidly
to its original level, and in so doing moves freely and smartly
up and down before finally settling to be steady.
(c) Clearing of Blocked Water Gauges.
Should the water return to a different level, or
return sluggishly, a blockage of the passage ways is indicated.
To clear the blockage, close stop valves, (7) and (14),
disconnect stop valve coupling rod, (9) and thoroughly blow-out
each passage in turn, then re-assemble the connecting rod, and
test again as in (b).
Should the water still remain sluggish in the glass
the matter must be reported to the Driver Immediately.
g
Examination of Firebox.
The Fireman's next duty is to examine the inside of
the firebox and, in so doing, he should check the following
items:-
(a) See if there are any tubes, flues, stays, or fusible plugs
leaking by noting whether the walls of the firebox are free
of any traces of water, or steam.
(b) That the brick arch is complete, and in good condition.
(c) Whether the firegrates are in good condition, and in
correct alignment, and the operating mechanism, (where
rocking grates are concerned), IS in working order.


T 3
(d) That the firehole door is in good condition, and works
properly.
(e) Observe that there is sufficient live fire available to
spread presently over the grate, and upon which to build
up with fresh coal to provide the body of burning coals
that will be needed before leaving the shed.
Should there be anything amiss in regard to these
matters, the Driver should be promptly informed.
7
-j—j Opening of Smoke box Door.
Prior to opening a smokebox door the firehole door
should always be closed, and the blower steam valve opened, so
as to prevent the possibility of a back draft blowing flame
into the cab when the smokebox door is opened.
When the smokebox door is opened it should be opened
slowly, particularly if there is any possibility that the spark
arrester is blocked, in order to allow the escape of any
combustible gases that may have accumulated in the smokebox.
In addition, flare lamps must be kept at a safe distance away
from the smokebox door opening until time has been allowed for
any such gases to escape.
g
-j—g- Examination of Smokebox.
The following details in the smokebox should be
examined by the Fireman for defects
(a) Check for indications of water, or steam, leaks from
boiler tubes and steam pipe joints.
(b) Note that the spark arrester mesh is clean and undamaged.
(c) See that all ashes have been removed, especially from
around steam pipes, and back of the blast pipe.
(d) Observe that the foundation is in good condition.
(e) Note (with a self-cleaning type of smokebox) that the draft
(or apron) plate is in position, and both cotter pins to
hold same down are inserted.
(f) Also see that the smokebox door ring is clean of any ashes.
(g) After closing, and then tightening, the smokebox door it
should be tested for air leaks with the blower turned on
by using a lighted flare lamp, and running the lamp flame
around the door joint. Any door that fits badly, and
would result in drawing air seriously, as shown by the way
the flame is drawn in, should be brought under the notice


T=s
of the Driver.
(h) On locomotives fitted with multiple valve regulators,
regulators in the smokebox), the drain valve on the
right side of the smokebox leading from the internal steam
pipe of the boiler should be opened to allow any water
which may have accumulated there to escape. The valve
should be kept open until such time as it is observed that
dry steam only is issuing from the drain pipe outlet.
Q
Y~ g- Oiling of Westinghouse Air Compressor.
The Fireman is responsible for replenishing, the supply
of oil to the air cylinder lubricator of all single stage
Westinghouse Brake Air Compressors.
The oil for this purpose is contained in the small
round can with which the Fireman is provided in the kit, and is
the only oil that should be used for this purpose.
To permit the filling operation to be performed while
the compressor is running the cap nut is provided with vent
holes, so located that when the seal between the cap and body
is broken the air pressure is vented to the atmosphere. The
cap should be removed, and the lubricator then filled to within
1/4 of an inch of the top, and the cap nut firmly replaced.
Special care should be taken not to allow any dirt to enter the
lubricator during the filling operation.
10
1-3 Examination of sand boxes.
The next duty of the Fireman is to examine the sand
boxes, and ascertain that they are full of clean, dry, sand and
that the strainers (where provided) are in position.
TZJ Starting of Westinghouse Air Compressor.
On returning to the cab (and provided there is
sufficient steam pressure, 30 lb per square inch or more) the
Fireman will place the brake valve handle in the lap position,
prior to starting the Westinghouse Air Compressor, in order that
the Driver may later carry out the brake valve test. Air
pressure will also be required to apply the brakes when it
becomes necessary to move the locomotive for any reason, but for
this purpose the brake valve handle will first have to be placed
in the full release position for a few seconds.
When starting the air compressor the steam valve should
not be opened fully, but only sufficient to allow the compressor
to work very slowly, to begin with. If the valve is opened


fully when starting the compressor after it has been out of
service for some time damage may be caused to the piston and
cylinder of the steam end, due to the presence of water
(condensed steam) in the pipe lines etc., and also to the
piston and cylinder of the air end, due to the absence of air
pressure to provide a cushion for the piston of the air
cylinder at the end of its stroke.
When about 40 lb. per square inch Main Reservoir Air
pressure has been established, the steam valve may then be
opened fully.
FIRE IRONS.
(a) Hand Fired Locomotives-.
The Fire Iron equipment on hand-fired locomotives
(and which should be retained, without removal, and ready to
hand on the locomotive) is as follows:-
One Dart.
One Short Pricker.
One Long Pricker.
- ~ One Long Rake.
(b) Stoker Fired Locomotives.
These locomotives have:-
One Short R a ke.
One Long Rake.
One Short Pricker.
It is the Fireman's duty to check this equipment to
ensure that it is complete, and in a satisfactory condition for
service.
13
Back Tool Box and Gauge Glass Container.
The Fireman is responsible for checking the seal on
the "Spare gauge glass Container" located in the cab, and the
"Back Box" tool container on the tender. He should now do
this and, should the seals be broken, or missing, he must
report same to the Driver.
■jij Spreading the Fire.
In determining the best time to spread the fire the
Fireman should keep in mind that a sufficient steam pressure
will be required to start the Westinghouse air compressor and
that, subsequently, a full head of steam will be needed to test


I^3
the correct pressure settings of the safety valves. In
deciding when to spread the fire for these requirements he
will also have to take into account the type of coal on the
tender, the boiler pressure already available, and the amount
of water in the boiler.
A full account of the -procedure to be adopted in
actually spreading and building the fire will be given in the
section on Locomotive Firing, (Section 4, following).
Examination of Ashpan.
The ashpan must be examined by the Fireman and, when
examining same, he should note the condition of the following
details:-
(a) The firegrates, as they can be seen through openings in
the ashpan, to ensure that they are in good condition, and
in correct alignment.
(b) The inside of the ashpan, that it is clear of accumulated
ash, especially dn top of the bridge, with those types
that possess this feature,
(c) The cages (where fitted) that they are in position, and
any catches of same properly secured.
(d) The hopper doors (where fitted) that they are properly
closed, and the locking mechanism functioning correctly.
(e) The dampers (where fitted) that they are fully open.
(f) Spark arrester mesh, where it is fitted over any air
openings, that it is in good condition.
(g) The ashpan generally, to determine that no irregular
opening exists that would allow ashes to escape.
Oiling of Engine.
(a) Principle of Lubrication.
The prime object of lubrication is the reduction of
friction as much as possible by maintaining a thin film of oil
(or other medium) between any two metal surfaces in contact
with one another, as in the case of bearings, slide bars,
pistons etc.
If the film of oil is interrupted at any time then the
friction Increases, causing the parts to overheat, with the
possibility of same being destroyed.


135
A locomotive with bearings, and other moving parts,
poorly lubricated will, of course, require greater power to
drive it, than will one the corresponding parts of which are
well lubricated. It is, therefore, in the Fireman's own
interest to see that all these parts are properly lubricated,
as he has to supply the power (steam pressure) to drive the
locomotive.
Some of the more common causes of axlebox, and other,
bearings of locomotives becoming overheated, and which preparing
enginemen should be careful to avoid, are as follows
(1) The quantity of oil in the well is insufficient for the
length of the journey.
(2) The trimming feeds too fast, causing the supply to run out
before the end of the journey.
(3) Pieces of cork, or dirt, in the oil well causing the
syphon pipe to block, or, in the case of pin feed type
lubrication of big ends and coupling rod bearings, jamming
the pin.
(4) Trimmings dirty, or too tight in the syphon pipe, causing
the trimmings to feed too slowly.
(5) Corks, or oil well covers, not properly secured, and lost
en route.
(b) Fireman's Oiling Duties.
The Fireman is responsible for supplying the
lubricating oil required, and for using the correct grade, and
providing the right quantities, to the following parts of the
locomotive.
Parts to be Lubricated with Loco. Bearing Oil.
1. Below the Footplate
Below the footplate, on all classes of locomotives
fitted with inside valve gear (i.e., all except 27, 36, 38,
55, 57 and 60 Classes), the Fireman should oil the
eccentric straps, expansion links, valve spindle glands,
knuckle joints, and spring gear equipment.
On 27, 36, and 55 (i.e., those of the classes just
mentioned as having outside valve gear) the spring gear
equipment only needs oiling attention by the Fireman while,
with the 38, 57 and 60 Classes, no oiling of parts below
footplate level is required of him.


T 3
2. Above the Footplate:-
On all classes of locomotives he should oil the
following equipment, where fitted:- precision air
reversing gear lubricator, and piston rod gland of same,
"spot” oil reversing shaft universal coupling pins,
reach rod brackets, regulator gland on side of smokebox,
whistle valve air piston; spindles of steam valves for
air compressor, and for the blower and injectors, tender
brake gear bearings, firehole door hinge pins and air
operating cylinder.
Parts to be Lubricated with Cylinder Oil.
In addition, it is the duty of the Fireman to
lubricate with cylinder oil the following parts, where
fitted:- superheater damper door cylinder, and the
auxiliary oil cups for the piston rods and valve spindles
of the locomotive.
17
Examination of Mechanical Lubricator.
During the preparation of locomotives fitted with
mechanical lubricators it is the Fireman's duty to check the
oil levels showing in the gauge glasses, or on the dip stick,
so as to ensure that there is the required amount of oil in
the lubricator (or lubricators). He should then rotate the
ratchet handle of the lubricator at least 12 times, to ensure
that the oil pipes will be primed full up to the terminal check
valves, and so that oil will be delivered to the moving parts
of the locomotive immediately it is moved. He should then
(or at the first opportunity) inform the Driver of the amount
of oil that he has found contained in the lubricator (or
lubricators).
18
Filling of Hydrostatic Lubricator
On locomotives fitted with hydrostatic lubricators
(Detroit type) it is the duty of the Fireman to fill same with
the prescribed quantity of cylinder oil.
The method to be adopted when filling a hydrostatic
lubricator (Figure 1-2-25) is as follows;-
(1) Close the steam supply valve on top of the boiler, and
all other valves supplying steam from the boiler to the
lubricator. Also make sure that all the valves on the
lubricator itself are closed.
(2) Open the water drain valve (g)
(3) Remove the oil filling plug (o)


T=3
(4) Close the drain valve (g) when sufficient water has
escaped to permit the allowance of cylinder oil that
will be supplied to be poured into the lubricator oil
reservoir.
(5) After pouring the prescribed allowance of oil into the
lubricator oil reservoir any space then remaining therein
should be filled with water, thereby raising the level of
the contained oil until it almost begins to overflow at
the filling hole.
(6) Replace the oil filling plug (o) and tighten (but not
with excessive force).
(7) Fully open the steam supply valve on top of the boiler.
(8) Open the steam valve (b) on top of the lubricator, fully.
(9) Open fully the condensate, or water feed, valve (d) also
on the lubricator.
WARNING:
Do not attempt to remove the oil filling plug if there
is any sign of steam pressure remaining in the lubricator.
This condition will usually be indicated by water, and/or steam,
squirting from the drain valve. It is also advisable, when
the oil filling plug is being removed, before completing the
unscrewing, to make sure that any steam that might be in the
lubricator escapes past the plug while it is loose in the
filling hole, but still held by the screw-thread therein. This
completes the Fireman’s preparation of the hydrostatic
lubricator. The operation of the main control valve, and
adjusting of the feed regulating valves, are the Driver's
responsibility.
TZ3 - Testing Injectors.
When sufficient steam pressure is available (full
working steam pressure, or not more than 20 lb per square inch
below that figure) the Fireman should test both injectors of
the locomotive.
When testing the injectors the following procedure
should be adopted.
(a) Check the hot water service control valve on the Fireman's
side of the engine to make sure that it is closed.
(b) Note that the hot water service hose is properly connected
to the control valve, and that the hose is in good
condition.


T 3
(c) The hot water hose, on all but 38, 57 and 60 class
locomotives, when, with the locomotive in service, it is
not being used, is to be run along the cab floor, and then
diverted so as to permit of it being accommodated between
the vertical handrail stanchion and the rear end of the
cab, and arranged so that the end of it will hang down
below the cab steps.
On 38 and 57 class locomotives the hose should be run
along the thumb screws above the cab window, then through
the opening in the cab back plate above the Fireman's seat,
and finally allowed to hang down at the back of the cab
there.
The hot water hose of the AD.6O class should be
placed in the brackets provided along the right hand
side of the inside of the cab, and the end allowed to
hang down behind the back of the cab.
NOTE: INJURIES have been sustained by employees being scalded
by water ejected from the hot water service hose, and it
is, therefore, essential that the greatest care be
exercised by englnemen, and others, to prevent such
injuries.
(d) With engines fitted with ashpan flushing gear also make
sure that the flushing valve is closed.
(e) Then test both injectors, each in turn, as follows
1. Note that no other employee is standing near the
injector overflow pipe.
2. Open the water control valve fully.
3. Open the steam valve. (With wheel type at least
one full turn)
4. Close, and quipkly again open (or ease back, and
quickly open) the water control valve, when the
Injector should commence to function,
5. While the injector is working thus check all steam
and water pipes and pipe joints for leaks, and
also.note that the hot water service and ashpan
flusher valves are not leaking.
(f) After completing the test, shut off the injector by first
closing the steam valve, and then the water control valve.
(g) If, after shutting off the injector, there is a blow of
steam from the overflow pipe it will indicate that either
the clack valve, or the steam valve itself, is blowing
through.


T=3

y-j Testing Lighting Equipment.
(a) Starting Turbo Generator.
When starting the turbo-generator care should be
exercised to open the steam valve slightly for a few seconds,
to warm the turbine, and clear out any water that may have
accumulated in the pipe line. The turbine should then start
readily, providing the steam pressure is sufficient.
(b) Short Circuit.
Should a short circuit develop in the electrical
wiring it will be Indicated by a braking effect on the turbine,
and a dimming of the lights.
NOTE: If this defect develops in traffic the flexible cbnduit
connections to the various cab lighting units should be
disconnected, in turn. Should the fault exist in one
of these the turbine will immediately run at the usual
speed, and the balance of the lighting system will
become normal. The defective unit should then not be
connected up again until after the fault has been made
good.
(c) Examination of Lights.
After the turbo-generator has reached its normal speed
the head light should be tested in both the full light, and dim
light, positions of the controlling switch. All marker and
engine lights should also be switched on, and checked to see
that they are operating.
(d) Spare Light Globes.
Engines required to work on unfenced lines (and other
branch lines specified) will be supplied with a spare head light
globe, which is carried in the back of the head lamp case.
The spare globe must be left in the carton in which it is
supplied to protect it from damage. A spare globe will not
be provided, however, on engines equipped with two head lights.
In the case of marker light, or gauge glass light,
globes, no spare is carried, but should one of these fail during
a journey a globe from one of the other marker lights, or engine
lights, may be used in its place.
21
Marker Light Settings.
The switching on of the electric marker lights on
steam locomotives, so that the correct lights may be exhibited,
both at the front and back end of the locomotive, is to be
performed by the Fireman,’ during the preparation. If the

locomotive will be going into traffic during the hours of
darkness, or if night is approaching, and also at any time when
it is dark during the journey and the direction of running
is to be reversed (also when standing in sidings, or crossing
loops) then the marker light settings are to be in accordance
with the instructions laid down in the General Appendix Part 11,
page 55, and the Safe Working Catechism, page 31.
Tall Disc.
The securing of the tail disc to the trailing end, in
the direction of running, of light engines, in accordance with
the safe working regulations, is also the duty of the Fireman.
OQ
—Checking Combination Automatic and Screw
1-3 Couplings!
(a) Testing.
On locomotives fitted with automatic couplings the
Fireman is required to test the release and locking mechanism
of the automatic coupling by pushing the jaw shut, and operating
the release handle, noting also that the swivel locking key is
in place. In the case of any screw coupling he must see that
the parts of the screw coupling work freely. A few drops of
loco, bearing oil may be placed on the pins and screw, but care
should be taken that the oil is not allowed to run over those
parts of the couplings which require handling during coupling
operations, as they will become slippery, and dangerous.


(b) Securing.
1. Loose Screw Couplings. When a separate screw coupling
is not required for use it must be carried on the front
drawhook of the locomotive, with both shackles over the
hook.
It must not be carried on the lamp bracket, or left
lying loose on the foot plate.
2. Fixed Screw Couplings. When the screw coupling is a
fixture to the drawhook the shackle must be secured on
the side hook provided.
3. Combination Automatic and Screw Couplings. The screw
coupling portion of a combination automatic and screw
coupling, when not in use, should be secured by threading
the ball weight spindle through the shackle, and then
resting the latter thereon.
24
Examination and Testing of Locomotive Staff
Exchangers.
When preparing a 36 or 38 class locomotive (or any
other steam locomotive that may be fitted for automatic Staff
exchanging) if it will be required to work over those single
line sections where automatic staff exchanging equipment is
employed (i.e. all staff stations between Maitland and Glenapp,
and between Junee and Albury) the Fireman at the Depot where the
engine is prepared must examine and test the exchanger to
ascertain that it is in good working condition. This require-
ment should be carried out in the following manner, and order
(a) Examine the exchanger apparatus (which is located on the
tender) to see that the shafts and levers are in the
correct position, and that no part is displaced, bent, or
missing.
(b) Examine the spring clip on the gunmetal receptacle, and
ascertain that it will hold the leather part of the sling
firmly, when this comes to be inserted.
(c) Check the spring loaded clip, which is fitted to the end
of the receptacle to hold the steel ring of the sling, to
see that it is in good working order, and has the amount of
tension required.
(d) Place a small quantity of loco, bearing oil on each of the
bearings, and also on the teeth of the operating gears.
(e) After checking to see that no other employee is standing
beside the tender in the vicinity of the path that the
exchanger will take when operated, the exchanger should
be lowered into its exchanging position, and a note made


TU
that it comes to rest neatly in the supporting bracket.
On 38 class locomotives the operation of the ram's horn
portion should also be watched to see that it also comes
to rest firmly on its supporting bracket.
(f) When the exchanger has been lowered, an examination should
be made of the ram's horn of the exchanger to see that
the prong portion of same is reasonably in line with the
side of the locomotive (and/or tender) both horizontally
and vertically.
The exchanger should then be returned to its normal
running position and, on 36 class locomotives, the locking
clip placed over the operating handle.
(g) If it should be found in lowering the exchanger that it
can only be actuated in such a jerky o!r rough manner that
the staff might thereby be dislodged from the gunmetal
receptacle, or that either of the clips are in a bad
holding condition, or that the prang portion of the horn
appears to be seriously out of line, the Fireman must
report the matter immediately to the Driver.
NOTE: The operation of the Staff Exchanger in service is
described in Subject No. 23
TIS
Taking Water.
It is the Fireman's duty, when preparing a locomotive,
to see that the tender water tank (or other tanks) are filled to
capacity.
When completing the taking of water the water control
valve of the water column should be closed slowly, and the last
few inches of the tank filled with a reduced flow of water.
Should the valve be turned off quickly the disturbed condition
of the water in the tank may make it appear that the latter is
completely filled, when it is not. Also damage may occur to
the pipes supplying the water column.
After taking water, the jib should be returned to a
position parallel to the running line, and the ring on the end
of the chain placed over the hook provided. Under no
circumstances should the chain be thrown off the tender after
the jib has been swung back into position.
NOTE: Also, Regulation 2 (f) Page 209 of the General
Appendix, Part 1, states that:-
Drivers and Firemen, and all others engaged
taking water, are responsible for seeing, after an
engine has taken water at any station, that the air
cocks between the engine and leading vehicle have not


T=3
been closed, or interfered with.
The tender tank lid should always be closed after
water has been taken, except when the next station where water
will be taken is located within an electrified area, in which
case the lid must be left open. It must remain so until
the first station outside an electrified area is reached where
water is taken, when, if not about to enter another electrified
area, it must be closed.
When taking Water at a watering station within the
electrified area the operation of the column (Elephant's trunk
type) should be carried out as described in Figure(l-3-1).
(i) Pull down rod No. I to release catch.
(ii) Wind jib round by wheel No. 2 to suit filling hole.
(iii) Extend jib by lever No. 3 and direct jib into filling hole by handle No. 4
Civ) Turn handwheel No. 5 to turn water on.
(v) Alter taking water, raise ratchet lock No. 6 and return jib to normal position by
operating hand-wheel No. 2. A catch is provided to lock jib in normal position
clear of the line, and every precaution must be taken to see that Jib is locked
before leaving.
Water Column for Electrified Areas.

2fi
y-j Trimming of Coal etc.
After taking coal, and before going into traffic, the
Fireman should see that the coal is not stacked too high, and
that it is so arranged that it will ride on the bunker without
falling off when the locomotive is running, that the catwalks
around turret type tenders are clear of any pieces of coal, and
that the fire irons and tools carried on the tender are so
placed that they will not fall off.
y 27 Stowing Kit.
The correct stowing of the kit varies on each class of
locomotive, and the Trainee Engineman will be instructed as to
the best method by the Travelling Inspector during his initial
training. However, it should always be remembered that no
article of the kit should be placed in such a position that it
could create a hazard of any kind. Two examples of incorrect
stowing of kit, which must be avoided, are;-
(a) The attaching of screw wrenches to the boiler water gauge
bracket in such a way as to cause difficulty in shutting
off the water in the event of a gauge glass breaking.
(b) Placing shovels in cab handrails, which creates a danger to
employees requiring to use these rails.
Piloting within Loco. Points.
With certain exceptions (as authorised, and prescribed
by local General Order), the movement of engines over points,
crossovers and converging roads in Loco, yards, and through any
engine shed, is to be piloted by the Fireman preceding the
engine, on the Driver's side, and hand signalling for the
movement of it during daytime, and by a light when it is dark.
29
■j—g- Operation of Turntables.
When about to place a locomotive on a turntable, the
Fireman must pilot the engine on to the table, and he must
before-hand assure himself that the turntable is correctly set,
and that the pawls are in place. On power operated tables the
lever operating the pawl must be placed at the full extent of
its travel in order to ensure that the pawl is properly inserted
and that the rails will be in correct alignment. The engine
must be stopped just before going on to the turntable, and the
Fireman must precede it thereon, and balance the table down to
the rail level by placing his own weight on the end at which
the locomotive will approach, in order to prevent damage from
Impact when the engine or tender wheels land on the table.


I=3
After turning the engine, the Fireman must again
check to see that the correct road is set, and that the pawls
are in position, before signalling the Driver to proceed off
the table.
NOTE: Care should always be taken to stand at the side,
and never behind the pawl, when about to drop it into
position on a hand operated table which is moving
and, in any case, the table should be slowed down as
much as possible when the point is reached at which
the pawl is to be dropped into place.
30
-i—Proceeding into Traffic and through
Marshalling Yards.
When proceeding through congested areas, such as
marshalling yards, etc., it is the Fireman’s duty to keep a
sharp and constant lookout for any dangerous situation that
may cause a collision, or derailment, and he must repeat
Immediately to the Driver any hand, or fixed, signals that
may be exhibited to him.
31 Coupling Up.
I—3
Where it is the duty of the Fireman to couple a
locomotive to a train he should assure himself that the
conditions laid down in the General Appendix Part 1, Page 143,
have been complied with.
Special attention is drawn to Regulation 128 (c) which
states that:
"When a vehicle fitted with vestibules, or diaphragm
buffer plates, requires to be coupled to another vehicle,
or to an engine, the operation must not be performed unless
the buffers are in contact, and the vehicle and engine are
both stationary. Employees must not stand in the four-foot
(as is the usual practice when coupling vehicles fitted with
ordinary buffers), but must wait until the vehicles and
engines have been brought to a stand with the buffers closely
compressed before attempting to couple the vehicle."
After coupling up to his train, care should always be
taken by the Fireman to see that both train pipe cocks leading
to the hose pipes which he has coupled together are FULLY open.
32
XZJJ Uncoupling.
Although not involved in the preparatory work required
before commencing train working with a locomotive, it is
appropriate to quote here Regulation 128 (f) Page 144 General


T=3
Appendix, Part 1, which states that:
"When uncoupling a vehicle, the Fireman, or other
employee concerned, after closing the air taps, disconnect-
ing the air hoses, and applying the air brake on the train,
must not stand in the four-foot, but must come from between
the engine and vehicle before signalling the driver to
ease up. When this movement has been completed, and the
engine held in position by means of the engine brake, with
buffers closely compressed, the coupling is to be removed.
It is important that no movement be made whilst the
employee is engaged between the tender and carriage."

Sub-Section A. General and Preparatory.
Introduction.
This section deals with the combustion of coal, and with
the building, and maintaining, of a fire in a locomotive from
the time it is kindled to the time it will either be recondit-
ioned on an intermediate pit during a journey, or knocked out on
the completion thereof. For the guidance of Trainee Enginemen
the procedure involved is set out as nearly as possible in the
order in which the work required should be carried out.
There are two methods by which locomotives using coal as
a fuel are fired on the New South Wales Railways. The first
(and oldest) method is that of providing the Fireman with a
suitable shovel for conveying the coal on the tender to the
firebox of the locomotive boiler. The second method, which is
employed on some of the larger locomotives, is to equip the
locomotive with a mechanical conveyor system, known as a
mechanical stoker, for this purpose.
The same general principles that are involved in hand
firing apply also to stoker firing, but as the Trainee Engineman
will not be trained on stoker fired locomotives until he has
become proficient at hand firing a description of stoker firing
will be given in a later section, and the general principles of
firing,and the practice of hand firing only, will be dealt with
here.
o
Combustion of Coal.
Coal is a combustible substance, chiefly composed of
fixed carbon (or coke) with volatile hydrocarbons, and other
constituents in smaller and varying proportions. When a
shovelful of coal is placed on a fire, it is the gases formed
by the volatile hydrocarbons, and various other gases, that are
first driven off by the heat, the fixed carbon (or coke)
remaining to be burned on the grate more slowly.
Both the fixed carbon and the volatile hydrocarbons will
burn after being heated to what is known as their ignition
temperature but, for this to occur, they must also be supplied
with oxygen from the air.
Air is composed almost entirely of two gases, nitrogen
and oxygen, of which the latter is the one essential for burning
any combustible substance, in this case the volatile hydrocarbons
and fixed carbon of the coal. The nitrogen, which constitutes
approximately 77% (by weight) of the gases contained in the air,
1-4

T3J
plays no active part In combustion, the gas which does so being,
as stated, the oxygen, which comprises 23% (by weight) of the
content of the air.
Vlth the three requirements, fuel, air (oxygen) and a
proper temperature, all being present, burning will take place,
but with any one of these three lacking it will not.
As burning proceeds the fuel disappears, with the
exception of the Incombustible impurities In the coal, which
will either remain on the grates, or fall through them Into the
ashpan, unburned.
Vhen coal Is placed on the fire In the firebox of a
locomotive It first absorbs some of the heat, and then, as has
already been Indicated, it separates into Its various component
parts. Any moisture (water) contained is quickly driven off in
the form of steam, as soon as the fuel reaches a temperature of
212 deg. Fah., while the volatile hydrocarbons begin to come off
as combustible gases at about 350 deg. Fah., and continue to do
so until the coal reaches a temperature of about 900 deg. Fah.,
when all the volatile hydrocarbons will have been driven off,
and the fixed carbon only will then remain burning on the grate.
At 1,800 deg. Fah., the volatile hydrocarbons themselves split
up into their separate components of hydrogen and carbon, and
these burn, and this, therefore, Is the minimum temperature that
should be maintained In the firebox of a locomotive to ensure
that the combustion process of these components of the coal Is
accomplished. The highest efficiency, however, Is obtained
when temperatures of 2,000 deg. Fah., or over, are reached.
Then the free carbon of the volatile hydrocarbons, if there is
sufficient oxygen present, burns completely to form carbon
dioxide, and the hydrogen to steam, and likewise the fixed carbon
(or coke) also burns, under the same conditions, to carbon
dioxide. The Incombustible matter, however, remains as ash,
and other Impurities, unburned. But, with too low a
temperature, or an Insufficient supply of air, neither the fixed
carbon nor the free hydrocarbons will be completely oxidised.
They will then burn so as to-form only carbon monoxide, Instead
of carbon dioxide. It should, in this connection, be understood
that if carbon Is Imperfectly burned thus, and forms carbon
monoxide only, there will be produced no more heat than 4,500
British Thermal Units per lb of this substance burned, the
remaining capacity for generating a great deal more heat
possessed by It not being utilised. On the other hand, If
burned perfectly to form carbon dioxide, one lb of carbon will
produce 14,500 British Thermal Units. By Imperfect combustion
of the kind first mentioned, therefore, there Is a loss of
10,000 British Thermal Units for every lb., of carbon burned in
this unsatisfactory way.
(One British Thermal Unit (B.Th.U.) Is the quantity of
heat required to raise one pound of water by one degree,
Fahrenheit, while coal, as has been earlier shown, is composed
mainly of carbon, in one form or another.)


T=S
Theoretically, it requires, on the average, approximately
12 lb. of air to effect the complete combustion of 1 lb. of
bituminous coal but, in practice, owing to the difficulty in
supplying the air in such a way as to bring the proper quantity
into close contact with every particle of the fuel during the
combustion process, it usually needs 20 lb. of air per lb.
of coal to burn this fuel properly. However, if much air in
excess of this is supplied (as is likely with a very thin fire)
the large quantity of nitrogen involved (with, also, the excess
oxygen) will not only pass through the boiler without performing
any useful function there, but will unnecessarily absorb heat
which could otherwise have been used to generate steam.
This, then, in outline is a description of the process
of combustion, as it relates more particularly to coal as a
fuel, and to the events that take place when this is burned in
the firebox of a locomotive. If, to some, it may appear
(though really it is not) a rather complicated matter, it
remains only for their benefit to remark that, translated into
practical terjtas for the guidance of the Locomotive Fireman, it
indicates that the most satisfactory and economical results
require
1• That there should be maintained the maximum temperature
possible of the fire, and of the products of combustion in the
zone immediately above the same, over the whole area of the
fire grate, and (2) that, with the application of the fuel, as
needed from time to time, this should be in such quantities on
each occasion, and in such a way, as will neither unduly reduce
the temperature of the firebed in the region where the fresh
coal is placed, nor prevent the necessary quantity of air from
having easy access to the same, or to the gases given off by it,
and (3) that, in order to provide the best conditions, the
thickness of the fire Itself should be no greater than is
necessary to generate, from the fuel actually contained in the
firebox, the amount of heat needed to supply the quantity of
steam that at the time is, or presently will be, needed by the
working of the locomotive, though never allowing it, either, to
become anywhere so thin as will permit excess air in any quantity
to be drawn in, and so to reduce firebox temperature below the
maximum attainable.
If these conditions are observed, and prevail, the
process of efficient combustion will automatically follow in
the way that has been described, and to the satisfaction of all
concerned, there will be free generation of steam in the boiler,
the maintenance of full working pressure to supply power to the
locomotive, and the most efficient use made of the coal that
has to be fired in order to secure the same.


T3f
_5-r Classes of Coal.
1-4
From a practical aspect the most important features
relating to the characteristics of the coal that a Fireman has
to take into account, in order to be able to maintain a full
head of steam throughout a journey and, at the same time, by
securing efficient combustion to do this with maximum economy,
(and a minimum of effort and worry on his part) are:-
1. Whether the coal on the tender is a quick, or slow, burning
type. This factor is governed mainly by the amount of
volatile hydrocarbons contained in the coal.
2. Whether the coal contains a high, or a low, ash content.
This factor will to a large extent govern the heating
value of the coal, and will affect the periodic attention
that has to be given in cleaning the fire.
In these respects there are, generally speaking, three
classes of coal available for locomotive use in New South
Wales, each class being known, roughly, by the area from
which it is mined, and the characteristics of them are as
follows
(a) Northern Coal.
In appearance this coal presents a shiny, black surface,
with grain cleavage lines approximately half an inch
apart running through it. Large pieces are easily
cracked and, when given a sharp blow with a hammer, they
split cleanly along the grain.
On an average these coals contain the highest percentage
of volatile hydrocarbons, the lowest ash content, and
the highest calorific value of any of the New South
Wales coals.
(b) Western Coals.
In appearance this coal is a slightly duller black than
Northern coal, the pieces are more regular in size,
with very few large lumps being present. It is also
much harder than Northern coal, and has a less
discernible grain structure.
The amount of volatile hydrocarbons is much less than
with Northern coal. It also contains a much higher ash
content, which necessitates the use of the rocking
grates to keep the fire at the required thickness for
the admission of sufficient air. Some of the Western
coals also contain an ash which tends to swell, thus
thickening the firebed very quickly.

(c) South Coast Coals.
In appearance this coal is more of a greyish black, with
a fine, closely spaced, irregular grain structure
running through it. It is somewhat softer than Western
coal and, although the large lumps may be difficult to
crack, it is friable under impact, or any grinding
action and, in consequence, is likely to produce much
fine coal especially if roughly handled before being,
or when, placed on the tender of the locomotive.
The South Coast coals contain the lowest amount of
volatile hydrocarbons of any New South Wales coals, and
are the slowest burning of the three varieties, while
the ash content is usually slightly less than with
Western coal.
(d) The following list gives an indication of the chief
constituents of the average of coals from the three
areas concerned:-

IZ?’ Using the Shovel.
One of the first difficulties encountered by a Trainee
Engineman is in acquiring the right stance for holding and
wielding the shovel, and in directing the charge of coal in
such a way that it reaches the place desired on the fire, and
is well distributed there.
There is often a natural tendency to impart an upward
movement to the top of the shovel at the end of the stroke, with
the result that the coal strikes the brick arch, and falls on
*2 3k® *f rebed in a confined area, forming a mound in the middle
oi the firebox. To overcome this tendency the Trainee Engine-
man is advised, when firing, to stand with his back as straight
possible and, when swinging the shovel, (if firing from the


T3f
right hand side of the engine) to keep the left hand high in
relation to the right hand, and so "shoot" the coal off the
shovel in a slightly downward direction.
After becoming proficient at shooting the coal off the
shovel the Trainee Engineman will find that, by using the left
hand and giving a twist to the vrrist of same, he can turn the
blade slightly at the end of the stroke and, by this means,
each shovel full of coal may be spread more evenly over any
desired section of the flrebed, and diverted more to either
side of it rather than to the centre, as may be desired, and
best for the shape of the fire.
Spreading the Fire.
When taking charge of a locomotive in which the fire
has been banked the procedure to be adopted, when spreading
the fire, is as follows
(a) Open the blower slightly.
(b) Inspect the firebox, and contents, as described in
0
Subject No.-j^
(c) Then loosen the bank under the firehole door with the dart,
paying particular attention to the back corners of the
firebox and, at the same time, moving the body of fire
forward slightly.
(d) Should there be ah accumulation of dead ash under the bank
it should be removed by operating the rocking grates in
this area.
(Note: If the dead ash is not removed, it will block the air
holes in the grate, with the result that difficulty will
be experienced in maintaining the highest firebox
temperature, owing to there being an insufficient flow
of air to maintain complete combustion.)
(e) The live coals should then be evenly distributed over the
whole of the grate by the use of the pricker.
When using the pricker care should be taken to avoid
getting the point of the pricker jammed in the air openings
of "Rosebud" type firegrates, or between the bars of the
straight type.


Building the Fire.
When building a fire it is advisable to use lumps of
coal no smaller in size than a man’s fist, in order to form a
firm base and, at the same time, leave apertures for the free
circulation of air through the firebed. At all times the use
of slack coal for the purpose of forming the fire should be
avoided. This lumpy coal should be applied in a series of
light layers over the firebed, until the required thickness of
fire has been obtained, allowing sufficient time between the
application of each layer for the previous layer to become well
ignited.
(Note: This matter of time applies particularly to South Coast
coal which, as previously stated, is of a very slow
burning nature.)
On locomotives fitted with firegrates which have little,
or no slope, the fire should be built evenly over the whole of
the firegrate until the required thickness is obtained. This
is known as a flat fire.
On locomotives fitted with a sloping firegrate it is
advisable to build the fire heavier under the firehole door, and
to have it tapering off to a light fire at the front. This is
known as a sloping, or wedge shaped, fire.
By the time that departure from "Loco" arrives the fire
should be well burned through, with a good body in the firebox
(though less with Northern than with other coals) while the
steam pressure should have been brought round to some 10 to
20 lb. per square inch below blowing off pressure. There
should also be a good glass of water in the boiler, though not
so much that the injector cannot be put on upon reaching the
train should it be desired to check any excessive blowing off
from taking place.
1 7 4 Proceeding to Join, and departing with, the train.
When running between "Loco" and the point where the
locomotive will be attached to the train further care should be
taken to have the water level in the boiler, and the amount of
fire in the firebox so arranged that a margin will be available
to avoid the blowing off of the boiler, and the emission of
black smoke when finally building the fire prior to departing
with the train.
The final adjustment of the fire, water levels, and
steam pressure Just prior to departure should be such that,
while the Driver is starting the train, the Fireman will be free
to observe the "right—aways" given by the Guard and, in the case
of a passenger train, to watch the carriages clear the platform,
before it is necessary for him to attend to the fire.

A General Review.
Locomotive firing is different from the firing of any
other type of boiler, (or furnace) in that an ever, and often
drastically, changing demand is made for the supply of steam
from the boiler.
On a ship, or in a power house, the output is regulated
to a set requirement which does not change for hours at a time,
thereby permitting the Fireman to adopt an almost constant rate
of firing. The draft, also, is regulated, and does not vary.
With a steam locomotive, however, this is not the case, as the
regulator position, and the point of cut-off of the steam in the
cylinders, have to be constantly altered to meet the changes in
tractive effort and power output required for different
gradients, and for varying speed, while the conditions brought
about by downhill running without steam, and by stopping and
starting, have an even greater effect. Accompanying, and
consequent upon these changes, also, is a variable draft, which
automatically intensifies with an increasing demand on the
boiler, and lessens when it diminishes. And besides these
considerations, a Locomotive Fireman has many other important
duties, in addition to tending the fire and maintaining boiler
water level, to occupy him, while he has also to contend with
the often violent movements of the locomotive at speed.
It is because of the ever changing rate of demand for
steam supply on the boiler, and the fluctuating intensity of the
draft, that no satisfactory method of systematic firing can be
laid down, while the use of different classes of coal also
vitally affects the procedure. The best advice that can be
given to the Trainee Engineman is that, under most circumstances,
he should fire lightly and often, never heavy and seldom, and
when shortly about to encounter a steeper rising grade to build
up a heavier firebed ready to meet the harder working conditions,
doing this earlier if using South Coast coals than with Northern,
or Western, because it is slower burning, and so as to allow
time for it to become thoroughly well ignited. At all times a
regular inspection of the firebed (as described in Subject N 0.9
T3*
following should be made, and when so doing there should be
kept in mind the various indications of fire condition
(described in Subjects Nos. 10 and 11 later herein) in order to
maintain maximum firebox temperature, efficient combustion, a
steady boiler pressure, and safe boiler water levels.
9
"Reading" the Fire.
In order to maintain the fire in a proper condition
during the journey the Trainee Engineman should learn to "read"


the fire, so that he will be able to determine exactly where
the next delivery of coal should be placed. This is done by
observing the colour of the firebed, and the more important
indications thus to be noted are as follows
(a) If a section of the firebed is giving off a long, orange
coloured flame this will indicate that the combustion of
the coal in this region has not yet reached an advanced
state and, until this occurs, and a higher temperature
of the gases is shown, further coal should not be added
to this area.
(b) If, in another section of the firebed, a bright lemon
colour is to be observed it will indicate that the coal
here is burning fiercely, with combustion and temperature
approaching peak level and, accordingly, additional coal
may be placed in this area.
(c) If a section of the firebed exhibits a very bright, white
hot appearance, it indicates that the fire will shortly
become thin in this section, the state of combustion and
the temperature generated having reached the ultimate
limit, and being about to decline, and additional coal
should be added to the place concerned immediately.
Aids to "Reading" the Fire.
The Trainee Engineman who experiences trouble in seeing
the firebed through the flames may find it helpful to carry a
piece of coloured glass, such as that used by electric welders.
The dark colour of the glass will absorb the brighter colours
of the fire, thus reducing the glare, and so providing a better
view of the firebed.
Another aid that can be used is to turn on the blower,
and then to place the shovel about half way through the firehole
door, and turn the blade over so that it will direct the draft
of air passing through the firehole door down on to a section
of the firebed. This draft of air will tend to clear the smoke
and flames from around the area where the draft is thus being
directed, giving a clearer view of that part of the firebed.
"Reading" the Smoke.
A further indication of the condition of the fire is
given by the colour of the smoke coming from the chimney.
a) A yellow smoke will indicate that a large amount of fresh
coal has been placed on top of a fire which itself was not
properly alight, also that the firebox temperature is very
low. A fire that gives off such a smoke is known as a
"green fire". This condition can occur very easily when


T 3?
lighting a fire up in a cold boiler.
(b) A dense black smoke will indicate that, for the time being,
too heavy a fire has been put on, and a large quantity
of volatile hydrocarbons are being wasted, due to a
temporary insufficiency of air for the combustion of the
large volume of these gases that has been given off, and to
a sufficiently high temperature not being available to
burn them. The temporary insufficiency of air can often
be made good to the gases concerned by opening the firehole
door and, when firing the higher volatile Northern coals,
it is the practice to keep the firehole door wide open all
the time for this purpose. However, the emission of black
smoke may also be due to the fire having become so thick
and heavy, generally, that the passage of air through the
firebed is being more or less permanently, and seriously,
restricted.
(c) A light brown smoke will usually indicate that the air-to
fuel mixture is just right, and that the highest firebox
temperatures are being generated, and the maximum combustion
efficiency over the grate area generally is being obtained.
(d) A completely clear chimney will indicate either that the
fire has burned through, and additional fuel is required,
or else that an excessive amount of air is entering the
firebox at some point where there is either a "hole" in
the fire, or it is locally too thin, causing the firebox
temperature (due to the excess air absorbing heat during
its passage through the firebox) to be reduced.
12
Firehole Door Colour.
On locomotives fitted with the "Webb" type of firehole
door a useful guide to fire conditions in the firebox can be
had by observing the changing colour of the door. When, with
door kept shut, the colour of same is a bright cherry red, it
will Indicate that the maximum firebox temperature is being
generated, but when the door is a dull red colour, or black,
it will indicate that the highest temperature is not being
attained, and an inspection of the firebed will then determine
the cause.
Boiler Water Levels.
It is of the utmost importance to see that the supply
of water to the boiler is at all times so maintained as
adequately to keep the firebox crown sheet, the superheater
flues and the boiler tubes, covered with water, and precautions
to this end are especially necessary when working over steep
inclines. In this connection reference should be made to
Figure (1-4-1) and to the diagram Figure (1-4-2), which latter

SEE SPECIAL REMARKS RELATING TO 057 CLASS ENGINES.
Diagram Showing the Effect of Rising and Falling
Grades on Boiler Water Levels.
Figure
shows the water levels in the boilers of some of the more
important locomotive classes when working under such conditions.
These diagrams should be carefully studied. Special attention
is directed to the diagram of water levels in 's7' class
locomotive boilers, showing the corresponding position of the
water in the boiler at half glass on a level road, compared
with the same on rising and falling grades, from which it will
be seen that, when on a 1 in 50 grade, or steeper, this amount
of water is beyond the range for reading in the gauge glass.
If the level of the water in the boiler is allowed to get low
when ascending a grade the front ends of the superheater flues,
or of the boiler tubes, will be exposed to the heat from the
fire while, when the top of the grade is reached, should the
locomotive then commence to descend a succeeding down grade,
the crown sheet of the firebox will not be sufficiently covered

with water to protect it from the heat of the fire. In
neglecting precautions to prevent these conditions occurring
serious risks are involved, and boilers are sometimes damaged.
If difficulty is experienced in maintaining the steam pressure
when ascending a grade it is better to stop for a few minutes
to raise steam than to run a risk by keeping up the pressure at
the expense of the level of the water in the boiler, and
allowing it to get dangerously low. Gauge glass cocks and
test cocks also should be frequently tested during the journey
to ensure that the water gauges are showing the correct water
levels.
„ Boiler Water Feeding.
1-4
Firing and boiler water feeding should form a working
partnership together, for when the feed is properly regulated
the most economical boiler operating results are obtained. The
method of feeding the boiler while the engine is working will
vary according to the character of the road ahead. On compara-
tively short, rising grades, or on short sections between stops,
it is a good plan, (if possible) to adjust the injector so that
it will deliver slightly less water than is being converted to
steam. (The rate of feed of an injector can be varied in this
way by adjusting the handle of the water control valve, though
the extent of such variation in the rate of feed supply that is
thus obtainable without the injector blowing off is limited.)
This method will help the Fireman better to maintain the boiler
pressure while steaming and, when subsequently drifting, or
standing, will allow the injector to be kept on for a longer
period, thereby helping to avoid the possibility of blowing off.
If, at the same time, the blower is used to burn the fire down
a little a better view of the firebed will also be afforded,
thus assisting the Fireman to ascertain its condition.
Finally, it is important to bear in mind that care must be
exercised at all times to prevent the boiler water levels
either exceeding the maximum desirable, or falling below the
minimum that will provide a good safety margin.
It is also one of the general principles in the joint
proceeding of boiler feeding and firing that the injector should
be shut off whenever the train is started from rest, or when,
after a period of drifting with the regulator closed, the engine
is put to steaming again. Also, under these circumstances, the
feeding of the boiler should not begin for a little while
thereafter, and until the fire has livened up, and resumed a
sufficiently fierce state of combustion under the regular action
of the draft, with some coal added to assist matters. Only if
the fire at the time be in an exceptionally good and hot
condition and the working of the engine at starting, or, after
steaming again, will be relatively easy, is it desirable to
depart from this general principle, for, otherwise, too big a
drop in steam pressure will result, which very often, it will
not be possible to recover for quite a long period.


TT3
Sometimes on the road, when the boiler pressure is
nearing blowing off point, it can be difficult to set the
injector to pick the water up and feed properly. If, after
several attempts, the Injector, under these conditions, will
not start feeding, and water continues to waste at the overflow,
success will then be obtained by proceeding in the following
manner. First make sure that no one is, or will be, near the
outlet of the hot water hose. Then fully open the injector
water control valve and, after that, the steam valve. Next
ease the water valve back as far as possible without steam
blowing out of the overflow. After this, open the hot water
hose valve slowly and fully, following which the injector can
be expected to start feeding. If this occurs the injector
water valve may then be opened up further, and finally the hot
water hose valve should be closed. The injector ought then to
continue working.
Maintaining the Firebed.
1-4
It is necessary to maintain the firebed to the correct
shape and thickness, irrespective of the rate at which the coal
is fired, so that the draft will be distributed as desired, and
the air to fuel ratio be kept constant, with the beet combustion
results thereby achieved throughout the entire journey.
When using the better cla-sses of Northern coals it is
possible to maintain the fixe in the correct thickness and shape
by the use of the shovel only, as the draft of the locomotive is
sufficient to keep the firebed open, and the small ash content
hardly affects the thickness by accumulated ash deposits.
These coals, also, do not tend to cake. However, when the
higher ash content, and/or caking coals are being used the
timely operation of the rocking grates, or fire irons, as the
case may be, is required both to keep the fire to a proper
thickness, and to maintain it with an open firebed.
In maintaining the firebed, (as in building up the fire)
also, it is necessary to keep in mind the different character-
istics and behaviour of the various kinds of coal. Thus, with
the Northern varieties, owing to the rapidity with which these
coals ignite, and burn fiercely, a prompt reaction from any new
coal added will readily be obtained, so that there will be
little delay in securing an increase in steam raising. Also,
Should in error rather too much coal at a time be placed on the
fire, while some temporary loss of efficiency in combustion will
follow, the fire will burn through fairly quickly, and the error
will thus soon be remedied. The same considerations, though
in a lesser degree, will likewise apply with Western coals. In
the case of the South Coast, and similar district coals,
however, the slower ignition rate is a property of these coals
always to be reckoned with. On this account there is usually
a delayed action, following any new fire being put on, in
securing the result in the form of increased fire activity, and


T=T
a rise in the rate of steam generation following, while if any
undue quantity at a time is placed in the firebox (expecially if
the fire at the time is low, or not burning fiercely under the
action of the draft) serious difficulty for maintaining (much
less increasing) steam pressure for a period thereafter may
easily follow. The slow burning characteristic of these coals,
the bearin S of same on the technique and timing
of tiring the locomotive, provide problems that require the
careful attention of those concerned.
Some of the difficulties with all classes of coal
commonly associated with the maintenance of the firebed, and the
methods of overcoming them, also, are as follows
(a) Should the ash and/or coal in the firebed have set firmly
even though the shape and thickness of the fire be
satisfactory, it will be necessary to open the firebed by
operating the rocker grates. The movement of the grates
will loosen the firebed, and permit a free flow of air
again On locomotives not fitted with rocking grates the
desired results will be obtained by running the fire irons
through the fire several times.
NOTE: The operation of the rocking grates, when running should
be carried out with the stirrup in the rocking position
only, and not in the dump position. In the dump
position there is always the danger of a large, or hard,
piece of clinker, or the like, getting caught between
two grate sections, and Jamming them in the open
position. Also, too much of the fire may be dropped
into the ashpan. Should either of these happenings
occur a large quantity of live coals will fall into
ashpan, resulting in the grates, grate coupling rods
(with rocking grates), and the ashpan Itself being
severely damaged.
(b) With coals having a high ash content the firebed thickness,
if not checked, will increase to such an extent that the
air supply will be greatly reduced and, in addition, should
the accumulation be allowed to proceed, the firebed will
eventually build up to the level of the brick arch at the
tubeplate, thereby having the effect of virtually reducing
the grate area, and also of completely blocking off the air
supply at the front part of the grate.
i T ? these excessive ash deposits down to a reasonable
level the rocking grates should be operated at intervals
throughout the journey, or, in the case of locomotives not
equipped with these grates, the fire should be attended to
by the use of the fire irons. When using the rockers
however, it is necessary to keep a constant watch on the
firebed to avoid the possibility of knocking out an excess-
ive amount of fire, causing the firebed to become too thin.


(c) Some types of ash form a very compact mass, which sometimes
cannot be broken up by the movement of the rocking grates.
To overcome this condition it is necessary to use the
pricker to break up the ash by running it backwards and
forwards through the firebed, (as would be done on a
locomotive not fitted with rocking grates) and then to
clear out the loose ash by rocking the grates.
When using the pricker care should always be taken not
to put it into a very hot fire, as there is a possibility
that the ash and any fiercely burning live coals may be
mixed in such a way that the ash will melt, and form a
clinker.
16
Ashpan Capacity.
Should the ashpan be filled with ash close up to the
level of the underside of the firegrates the flow of air to the
firebed will be greatly reduced. Also, should the ashpan be
overfilled thus in one part of it, the firegrates in the region
thus affected, will be deprived of the cooling effect of the air
passing through them, and may become overheated, and melt.
Care should also be taken when operating the rocking
grates to avoid depositing live coals in the ashpan, as they
will be fanned by the air passing through, which will cause them
to burn fiercely, resulting in damage to the ashpan. However,
to be on the safe side, the ashpan flusher, where fitted, should
be turned on for a few seconds after each rocking operation of
the firegrates, so that any fire that may have started in the
ashpan will be put out.
17
Reconditioning the Fire on Intermediate Pits.
When approaching an intermediate pit, where the fire is
to be cleaned and re-conditioned, the Fireman should, where
practicable, over the last few miles burn the fire down
sufficiently to allow of a clear view being had of the whole of
the firebed. The water level should also be so adjusted as to
allow the injector to be turned on from time to time while
standing on the pit, in order to prevent the blowing off of the
safety valves.
(a) Engines fitted with Flat Ashpan, and no Flushers.
The procedure that should be adopted when cleaning, and
reconditioning, the fire of a locomotive fitted with a flat
ashpan is as follows
1. Proceed into the pit, under the locomotive, and check that
the pit hoses are in a position where they can not be burned


T3f
by the hot ashes, and that the pit rake is available in the
pit for use.
2. Open the ashpan cages, and dampen the ashes, by using the
pit hose to prevent fine ash being blown on to the working
parts of the engine, and over the operator himself. Care
must be taken when using the pit hose to see that the water
does not come in contact with the underside of the fire-
grate, as the firebars may be cracked by the sudden change
in temperature.
3. So that there will be sufficient room in the ashpan for the
free movement of the rocking grates, first rake out enough
ash therefrom to allow the ash from the firebox to fall
clear of the firegrate coupling rods.
4. Next, the rocking grates should be operated in the cab of
the engine (with the stirrup in the dump position) until
all the dead ash, and any clinker, or other deposits, are
cleared from the fire, and only live coals remain on the
firegrate. It is a good practice, when doing this, to
observe the firebed after each stroke of the rockers.
WARNING: When operating the rocking grates in the dump
position care must be exercised so that the whole of the
fire is not lost.
5. As soon as the fire has been cleaned of all ashes a layer
of fresh coal should be placed over the fire.
6. The ashpan should now be finally and completely cleaned out,
particular care being taken to see that all the ash is
removed from the top of the bridges of those ashpans that
have this feature.
7. Lastly, the ashpan cages should be secured in the closed
position, the pit hoses placed clear of any hot ashes, and
care taken to see that no rake, or fire iron, is left where
it could foul any running line, or part of a locomotive.
(b) Engines fitted with Fixed Back Grates.
The C. 32 class locomotive has the two back grates fixed
and, in addition to the procedure set out previously, the fire
on these two grates has to be cleaned by the use of the dart,
particular care being taken to clean the back corners.
(c) Engines fitted with Hopper Type Ashpans and Flushers.
Where the hopper type ashpan and flushers are fitted to
a locomotive, the hopper doors should be opened, and the
flushers turned on, before operating the rocking grates, so that
the ashes will drop freely from the ashpan into the pit.


T3T
After the fire has been cleaned a check should be made,
through the damper, or other openings, to ascertain that there’
are no accumulations of ash remaining in the ashpan, special
attention being paid to the areas on top of the ashpan bridges
where there are any such.
On completion of the de-ashing operations care must be
taken to see that the flushers are turned off, the hopper doors
are tightly closed, and the locking medium, or any other safety
catch or closing device provided, has operated, or has been
operated, (as the case may be) correctly.
18
Reconditioning at Change-Over Stations.
Prior to arriving at a change-over station where the
engine has to be reconditioned, the Fireman is required to have
both oil feeders and (during the hours of darkness) flare lamps
prepared for the use of his own, and the oncoming Driver.
On arrival at the pit the incoming Fireman will take
water, while the outgoing Fireman will attend to the fire, the
latter attending to same in the appropriate way herein outlined
for re-conditioning it on an intermediate pit.
19
XIS Firebed Illustrations.
In order to assist the Trainee Engineman to become
proficient in the art of firing a locomotive, a number of
coloured illustrations have been prepared which show the various
irebed conditions that are likely to be encountered in actual
iring practice, and a careful study of these is recommended.
(a) Firing Procedure.
Each Fireman, after he has gained experience in the art
of firing, usually adopts a routine in firing practice in
his placing of the coal so as best to suit the class of
locomotive, the load being hauled, the type of coal being
used, and the gradients of the road over which he is
operating.
One of the basic firing procedures which has proved
very successful in assisting a Trainee Engineman in his
Initial firing trials is that shown in Figure (1-4-3).
This illustration shows a plan view of the firebed, in
which the white lines and numbers indicate, respectively,
the direction and area over which each shovel full of coal
should be distributed.
The first discharge of fuel is indicated by No. 1 and
No. 2, and this should be directed to the left and right


front corners, respectively, and should consist of rather
less than a shovel full of coal to each. The second
should then be directed half way down each side of the
box, as shown by Nos. 3 and 4, and should likewise consist
of rather less than a shovel full of coal to each point,
while the third discharge, Nos. 5 and 6, should be placed,
respectively, in the area around the left and right back
corners, in each of which a full shovel of coal should be
lodged. Finally, the fourth discharge is indicated by
No. 7, and consists of one full shovel full of coal
scattered across the centre of the firebox.
As it is the tendency of most locomotives to burn more
coal at, say, the rear third of the firebox than at the
front, it will be seen from the above description that,
by regulating the quantity of coal on the shovel, and the
correct placing of the coal on each occasion of firing, the
desired shape of the firebed can be maintained. Also, as
it is always better to have the fire a little thicker near
the plates at the sides, front and back of the firebox than
in the middle, if properly carried out the method described
will ensure this.
(b) Illustrations of Correctly Shaped Firebeds, and of the
Fire, During Process of Combustion.
1. The firebed illustrated in Figure(l-4-4) shows a correctly
shaped fire in the firebox of a locomotive fitted with a
firegrate that is virtually flat.
It will be noted that a layer of coal has just been
placed all over the firebed, and that a long, orange
coloured, flame has been formed owing to the burning of the
volatile hydrocarbons given off in the form of gases from
the coal. As these gases pass over the top of the brick
arch the colour changes to a lemon shade, which indicates
that they have been completely burned before entering the
flues and tubes. This sequence of events denotes that,
for the conditions existing, just the right amount of coal
has been added to combine with the air passing through the
firebed, that is to say that the air to fuel ratio, or
mixture, is correct. The chimney will also be reasonably
clear, and high firebox temperature will be obtained.
2. Figure (1-4-s)illustrates the same fire, but at a later
stage, one in which practically all the volatile gases, or
hydrocarbons, have been consumed, leaving only the fixed
carbon on the grates, and which is burning with a short,
lemon coloured flame. This indicates that the fire is
now ready for the addition of more coal, if this be required
for steam raising purposes,
3. Figures (1-4-6) and (1-4-7) illustrate the same conditions
as previously described, only this time in the firebox of
a locomotive fitted with a more heavily sloping firegrate.

It will also be noted that the shape of the fire is different
to that shown for a flatter firegrate, in that a local bank is
built up at the back beneath the firehole door.
As the draft of air passing through the long, narrow,
type of firebox, (to which this design of firegrate is mostly
fitted) is usually more severe on the back section of the grate
than elsewhere the local banking of the fire at the back has the
desired effect of retarding the flow of air in this area,
thereby causing a more even distribution of the draft over the
other sections. It also provides a supply of coal to feed the
firebed as it moves forward down the inclined grate while
combustion is proceeding, an action that is assisted both by
the draft and by the vibration of the moving locomotive. The
sloping bank at the rear of the firebox, however, should not be
over done, or else combustion on this part of the grate will be
unduly retarded, and the contribution that should be made there-
from to the total heat generated in the firebox will not be
forth-coming.
(c) Illustrations of Incorrectly Shaped Flrebeds, and of the
Fire, During Process of Combustion.
1. The Illustration shown in Figure(l-4-8) is also of a fire
in the firebox of a locomotive fitted with a heavily sloping
firegrate, and shows the conditions that will apply when
too much coal is added, especially to the local bank under
the fire door. It should be noted that the colours of the
flame in this case are much darker than previously, also
there are large quantities of volatile hydrocarbons passing
over the arch and into the flues and tubes in a black,
unburned condition, resulting in a heavy black smoke being
given off at the chimney, and causing low firebox
temperatures, with poor combustion efficiency.
In other words, the fuel to air mixture is incorrect,
there having been too much fuel added for the amount of air
being drawn in through the firebed, while the firebox
temperature has thereby also been unduly lowered, so that
both the ignition and subsequent combustion of the gases
given off have been adversely affected.
2, The firebed condition shown in Figure (1-4-9) is typical of
a badly shaped fire, and such as can more readily occur in
a locomotive fitted with a heavily sloping firegrate. This
condition is often caused by allowing the bank under the
firehole door to become too large, resulting in a heavy
formation of smoke in that region, which makes it difficult
to observe the condition of the rest of the firebed, and
which may then not be fired correctly. A large bank is
also Inclined to develop into a solid mound of poorly
burning coal under the fire door, Instead of a sloping,
strongly burning, wedge shaped bank, and the former develop-
ment makes it difficult properly to fire coal over the top
of the mound, and to place any Just in front of it. This


T3f
can cause much of the coal intended for the centre section
to be thrown too far, and be carried forward to the tube-
plate. The result of either of these errors can be a shape
for the fire as illustrated in Figure (1-4-9), with a heavy
bank at each end of the grate*, and a thin section in the
middle. This causes poor combustion, as will be seen by
the colour of the flame, and the amount of black smoke
passing into the flues and tubes, thereby making it difficult
to maintain a full boiler pressure.
3. Figure (1-4-10) Illustrates another, and a worse type of
badly shaped firebed that can also result from the above-
mentioned conditions, though it can also be caused by a
Trainee Engineman not being accustomed to the movement of
the locomotive, and being inexperienced in the use of the
shovel. The illustration shows the condition in question
occurring on a flatter design of grate, with which type this
fault is more likely to apply.
The large mound of unburned coal shown in the centre of
the firebox is usually created by the Fireman tilting the
blade of the shovel upwards when delivering the coal, for
one or other of the reasons Just given, this resulting in
the coal striking the brick arch, and falling in the centre
of the firegrate. Also, the remaining portions of the
firebed are of uneven thickness, a cause of which would be
failure to spread each shovel full of coal evenly over a
section of the grate (as described in Subject No. 4 , when
1-4
referring to the use of the shovel). A firebed of this
shape will cause the flow of air through the firebed to
vary, resulting in some sections of the grate receiving too
much air, and others too little, thus giving a very poor
combustion efficiency, which will make it practically
impossible to maintain the proper boiler pressure. When,
through firing errors, such a firebed shape has been formed
it is necessary to take steps to level the firebed to an
even thickness over the entire firegrate area. This may
be accomplished by using the pricker to level out the uneven
top or, when sufficient experience has been gained in
"reading" the fire, and if time, and the working conditions
with which the locomotive has to cope, permit, the mounds
of coal, (that is the dark coloured sections of the firebed),
can be allowed gradually to burn down by not placing any
more coal on them, at the same time carefully adding fresh
coal to the thin, or bright sections, until the firebed
becomes level again.
It is also important to remember that locomotives will
not steam with too thin a fire generally, with large, local
thin areas, or with a "hole" in the fire, any more than
they will with a fire that is too heavy. However, a fire
that is a little too light for the work (even though not
exactly what is required) can usually be built up to meet
the demand and is, therefore, one of the lesser errors into

(d) Incorrect Manipulation of Rocker Grates.
In dealing with the question of maintaining the firebed
(Subject No. 15) special attention was drawn to the danger of
I—4
overfilling the ashpan by operating the rocking grates with the
stirrup in the dump position, when working a train. In
Figure (1-4-11), now shown, there is Illustrated the condition
which may occur if this is done.
By this illustration it will be seen that the grates
have become Jammed open in the dump position, and live coals
have fallen through the openings, completely filling the ashpan
with the result that the firegrates, the grate coupling rods,
and the ashpan are being severely damaged, and eventually the
locomotive may well become a total failure, through the collapse
of all the grates into the ashpan.

T 3
Introduction.
On completion of the journey, and after any shunting, or
other work that may be required, has been completed, the
locomotive will be released from traffic, and will then proceed
to the Locomotive Depot, or other place where it will be
stabled while awaiting its next assignment.
The Fireman's duties in stabling the locomotive vary
according to the practice applying at the Depot. At some
Depots part of the work is carried out by the shed staff, but
at others this is not so. In order to cover the full require-
ments, a complete list is given of the stabling duties of the
Fireman in the following.
2
Uncoupling from the Train.
The method of uncoupling, as outlined in Subject No. 31
should be carried out, with the additional requirement that the
Fireman must attach the air hose of the locomotive to the dummy
coupling provided.
In daylight, and where required, he must place the tail
disc in position, or, at night, exhibit the correct marker
lights.
NOTE: It is also the duty of the Fireman to check these
details whenever a locomotive has been uncoupled by a
traffic employee.
3
y-j Proceeding from Traffic to "Loco".
When proceeding from traffic to "Loco" it is the
Fireman's duty to keep a sharp lookout, and he must repeat
immediately to the Driver any hand, or fixed signal, applying
to his locomotive, that he may see.
4
Piloting within Loco. Points.
These duties are the same as previously outlined in
Subject N0.^24. and they must be rigorously carried out.
SECTION 5.
STABLING A LOCOMOTIVE (FIREMAN’S DUTIES).


T 3
5
Taking Water.
This duty must be carried out in the way described in
Part (a) of Subject No. 24 with the Fireman again filling the
I—3
tender to capacity.
0
Coaling.
Prior to taking coal (if required) the Fireman should
close, and secure, the coal bunker doors, and place all fire
irons on their respective carrying brackets. The coaling of
stoker fired locomotives is dealt with in Section 7.
7 Blowing Down.
1-5
Every locomotive boiler has to be blown down before the
engine is stabled, so that the accumulated salt content, and
other impurities in the boiler, will be reduced sufficiently to
prevent the possibility of priming, or foaming.
Prior to blowing down,the Fireman should have his fire
in good condition, and not less than the equivalent of half a
glass of water on a level track in the boiler. The boiler
pressure should be about 10 lb. per square inch below the
registered working pressure so as, on the one hand, to prevent
blowing off at the safety valves as the quantity of water is
reduced in the boiler during the blowing down process, and, on
the other hand, to be high enough to permit the refilling of the
boiler again without losing too much pressure.
It is then the Driver's duty to carry out the actual
blowing down operation.
NOTE: The injector should not be operated while the blowing
down of the boiler is being carried out, as the compara-
tively cold water added will minimise the effectiveness
of the blowing down.
8
Cleaning of Smoke Box.
Where no other staff is available for this work it will
be necessary for the Fireman either to clean out the smokebox,
or else to inspect it and make sure that there are no cinder or
ash accumulations that require cleaning out.
Before opening the smokebox door for this purpose the
firehole door should be closed, and the blower turned on.
This will prevent any back draft that might otherwise occur,
when the smokebox door is opened, from blowing the flame of the


I=s
fire from the firebox into the cab. If the smokebox is of the
non-self cleaning type, and is to be emptied of ash accumulation,
the fire must be retained in the firebox until this has been
done, to reduce the risk of chilling the boiler. After the
smokebox door has been opened any cinder or ash accumulations
must be cleaned out with the shovel , particular care being taken
to see that no deposits are left around the steam and exhaust
pipes. The spark arrester must also be inspected, cleaned down
(if necessary) and any defective condition noted and, if found,
reported accordingly.
The smokebox door ring, and the footplate, must then be
cleaned of any spilt ash or cinders, and the smokebox door
closed.
y—s Banking the Fire.
The object of banking a fire is to have a mound of
slowly burning coal under the firehole door of sufficient size
to maintain suitable steam pressure and proper water levels in
the boiler while the engine is stabled, without undue waste of
coal. It also serves to provide a reserve of burning coals
upon which to build up the fire when, subsequently, the loco-
motive is required to be prepared for traffic duties again.
This will avoid the need for re-kindling the fire for this
purpose.
The condition of the fire, type of engine, class of
coal, and depot requirements have to be taken into consideration
when banking a fire, while the amount of fire banked must be
sufficient to keep the steam pressure high enough at all times
to work the injectors.
The usual method of banking a fire is to open the
blower slightly, and clean the back section of the firegrate,
then to rake a quantity of live coals from the front section
back under the firehole door such as, with any still remaining
there, will be sufficient to serve to form a base of live coals
for the bank. The front section of the fire should then be
dumped, and some fresh coal added to the base.
The blower (which, in any case, should not have been
opened more than necessary) should then be shut off, the ashpan
thoroughly cleaned out, and all dampers (where fitted) and the
firehole door closed.
Knocking a Fire All Out.
When the boiler is required for a washout, or for any
other attention which will require that the fire be knocked
right out, the Officer in charge of the Depot at the time will
advise the engine crew accordingly.


The fire roust then be completely dumped, and the same
precautions taken in regard to retaining a sufficient steam
pressure, and proper boiler water levels, and in respect of the
ashpan and dampers, as have previously been outlined in the case
of banking the fire.
11
IUJ Stabling for Boiler Washouts.
When a locomotive is due for a boiler washout the steam
pressure remaining in the boiler must finally be allowed to
escape after the fire has been knocked all out, and the engine
stabled. °
T ? 6 ®* ablin e Fireman is, therefore, required in
hIS ot *? r stablin g duties, to place a shield around
each injector overflow pipe, and to open each injector steam
valve fully, leaving same open thus for all the steam to escape.
12
XTS Taking Sand.
When taking sand from either a sand plant, or by bucket
the wire strainer (where fitted to sand boxes) must be in
position, and each box filled to capacity with dry sand, free of
mn^+ f h rei f n m^ er - 0n completion, the lids of the sand boxes
must be placed in position, and the hoses, or buckets, that have
been used replaced on the hooks that are provided at the place
where the sanding is done.
At all times during sanding operations care must be
aken not to spill any sand on the locomotive, as it may be
blown on to moving parts, such as slide bars, piston rods, etc
thereby causing excessive wear and damage,

ITS
Final Stabling of the Locomotives - Out Depots.
I—s
Where a locomotive has to be stabled at an Out Depot
the same procedure as at a Main Depot must be followed, except
that, if it is to be left stabled for a period in excess of six
hours (i.e. where there is no one on duty to attend the fire and
water levels in the boiler for that time) the fire invariably is
to be knocked right out and, ih addition to the normal stabling
duties it is then necessary for the Fireman to place a steel
plate over the chimney. (Fibre sheeting, or any other material
likely to disintegrate under heat, should not be used, as pieces
may fall down the blast pipe, and enter the valve chambers).
This plate will stop practically all the cold air from passing
through the boiler, keeping it warm for a much longer period,
thereby reducing the time necessary to raise steam when the fire
is again kindled, and also reducing chilling effects on the
plates and tubes.
It is also a good plan to place the wood for re-lighting
the fire on top of the boiler in the cab, to ensure that it will
be in a good, dry, condition when required. Care in doing this,
however, must be exercised so as pot to damage any of the cab
fittings.
NOTE' Where a locomotive is stabled, and there is no employee
on duty to attend the locomotive at regular intervals,
the gauge glass stop valves must be closed to avoid the
possibility of the water levels becoming dangerously low
should the gauge glass break.
, Returning Kit.
I—s
The Fireman, having finally stabled the locomotive, shall
then return the kit equipment to the store, or place it in the
locker provided, (as the case may be), in a clean condition,
with such items as will fit packed neatly in the bucket, along
with any dirty and unused cotton waste.
Prior to packing the oil feeders and flare lamps in the
bucket, any oil, or kerosene remaining in them must be drained
into the appropriate containers.
Signing Off.
When signing off, the Fireman should enquire of the
Roster Clerk, or Booker On, when, and what, his next turn of
duty will be, or, when doing diagram work, consult the diagram.
However, in the case of a Fireman working away from his
Home Depot with one Driver, and returning thereto with a
different Driver, or if, for any other reason, his times will


ITS
be shown on two, or more, different sheets, it will be necessary
for him to submit a Driver's sheet, in the following manner
1. Mark top of sheet EXPENSES ONLY.
2. Fill in the Fireman's (his own) name.
3. Fill in expense column.
4. In the remarks column give the different Drivers' names, and
dates of the journeys worked.
5. Sign Fireman's name in Driver's signature column.

Introduction.
The procedure that has already been outlined In
connection with the preparation, firing, and stabling of a
locomotive constitutes the major part of a Fireman’s duties.
However, when engaged in a Locomotive Depot, or in the working
of a train, he may be called upon from time to time to carry
out any of the following other duties as well:-
2
Lighting a Fire, and Raising Steam, in a
Locomotive - Main Depots.
1. Preparatory.
Prior to lighting up the fire in a locomotive it is
essential that precautions be taken to avoid the possibility of
damage to the boiler and engine, and the following procedure
should be followed:-
(a) Examine the glasses of the water gauges to see that
the protectors, and the gauge glasses themselves, are in
order. Open the water gauge stop valves, and then test
for water level, and accuracy in showing same, in the
usual manner.
NOTE; There should be approximately half a glass of water
showing in the gauge glasses, and never less than two
Inches.
(b) Next examine the firebox to ascertain that there are
no water leaks from the fusible plugs, crown stays, tubes,
superheater flues, or wall stays. See that the brick
arch, fire door baffle plate (where fitted) and flrehole
door are in good condition. Also examine and test the
rocking grates, and open dampers (where fitted).
(c) Then place the reversing gear in mid gear position,
open the cylinder and valve chest drain cocks, and secure
the regulator in the shut position with the locking pin.
(d) Now examine the outside of the boiler, and ascertain
that all washout plugs are tight, and neither the blow-
down cock, nor the mud hole door, is leaking.
(e) Next inspect the interior of the smokebox, and
ascertain that the superheater header and elements, with
the tubes, superheater flues, and washout plugs, are all
free of leaks, also that the spark arrester is in
position, in good order, and clean; and that the smoke-

box is clear of ash or cinder deposits, and (where
fitted), that the apron (or draft) plate is secured in
place. Also note that the smokebox door itself will
close, and can be tightened up properly by the hand wheel,
and that, so far as can be seen, it is air tight when this
is done.
(f) If about to light the fire, and the boiler is cold,
the smokebox door should not be fully closed, but left
slightly open, as this will reduce the effect of any
"sweating" action. This latter action is caused by the
moisture in the coal and air being turned into steam by
the heat of the fire in the firebox, and then condensing
back into water again as it comes into contact with the
cold internal surfaces of the boiler and smokebox, in
which last mentioned location (where it is warmer than
in some of the other areas) it can form into a vapour
again which will retard the natural draft operating on
the fire.
(g) Then check the ashpan to see that it is clear of ash,
or any other foreign matter, and that the doors, or
cages, are secured in the closed position.
(h) Finally, examine the tender and see that the lids of
the strainers (or strum boxes) through which the water
flows to the injectors are secured, that the hose bags
are coupled up, and that there is an ample supply of
water in the tender.
2. Lighting the Fire.
The foregoing will complete the examination of the
locomotive, and the fire may now be lighted in the following
way
(a) Place a small quantity of lumpy coal on the firegrate, a
short distance from the firehole door, to form a bed
which will prevent the kindling material, when applied,
from falling through the air openings in the grates.
(b) Now add to this bed of coal sufficient oil soaked wood
shavings to start the fire.
(c) The fire should then be started by throwing a lighted
match, or a small piece of lighted kerosene soaked cotton
waste, on to the oil soaked shavings.
(d) When the shavings are well alight a small quantity of
medium size lumpy coal should be added and, when this has
begun to burn well, more coal should be supplied, and
so on, until a suitable banked fire has been formed.
The firehole door should be closed each time after adding
coal in order to prevent the flame and smoke entering the
cab while, in the case of butterfly type fire doors, the
1-6


distance block between the two half sections should be
lowered to allow the doors to close completely.
(e) At regular intervals inspection should be made to see that
the fire is alight, and more coal added, if required, and
the boiler water gauge levels checked to see that they are
satisfactory.
(f) After the fire has become well alight, and the boiler
warm enough to prevent "sweating", the smokebox door
should be closed.
(g) The boiler pressure should then be raised to a pressure
that will ensure that the injectors will work satisfact-
orily, so that a safe water level can be maintained.
(h) Finally, the size of the banked fire should be regulated
so that there will be sufficient live coal available to
spread over the whole of the firegrate, and the boiler
pressure and water levels should be adjusted so that
they will be about 100 lb per square inch, and half a
glass, respectively, by the time the preparing Enginemen
take charge of the locomotive.
(i) Until the fire is about to be spread, the blower must not
be used, except very sparingly if it be necessary to clear
away smoke etc.,so that inspection may be made of the
banked fire, or the firebox.
3
y-g Lighting a Fire, and Raising Steam, in a
Locomotive - Out Depots.
When it is known that it will be necessary to light a ,
fire In a locomotive at an Out Depot, the Chargeman at the Main
Depot must make arrangements to have a supply of firewood placed
on the back of the tender, and an additional allowance of both
kerosene and cotton waste supplied with the kit.
At the termination of the outward journey the wood
should be placed on top of the boiler in the cab, so that it
will be in a good condition for lighting,care being taken in
doing this not to damage any of the cab fittings.
When building the fire, the procedure will be much the
same as at a Main Depot, except that the additional allowance
of cotton waste provided should be soaked with kerosene, and
laid on the bed of lumpy coal in place of the oil soaked
shavings. Some smaller pieces of wood should then be placed
over this, and a light applied. When the wood has started to
burn the rest of the wood should be added and, when this is
well alight, coal should then be placed on same.

-i— Authority to move engines.
I_6
When an Acting Fireman has gained experience on the
road he will, at times, be required to move engines within a
Locomotive Depot. The types of engines involved, and the
work that he will be required to do, are laid down in Rule 25
of the Instructions for the Guidance of Running Shed Employees,
and the instructions therein contained must be observed.
In order to become qualified to move engines it is
necessary for the Trainee Engineman to be able to describe, and
demonstrate to a Travelling Inspector, the correct and safe
procedure involved in the moving and stopping of locomotives of
the classes concerned.
In addition to the parts of a locomotive previously
described, there are additional parts of which the Trainee
Engineman will need to have a working knowledge before he can
be qualified to move an engine. These parts are as follows:-
Standard Westinghouse Air Brake System.
1-6
The Standard Westinghouse Air Brake Equipment, (Figure
1-6-1 and Figure 1-6-2) is the type mostly fitted to locomotives
that Trainee Enginemen may be required to move.
Basically, this system consists of an air compressor, a
main air storage reservoir, a Driver’s brake valve, a main pipe
line (brake pipe), a triple valve, a small air reservoir
(auxiliary reservoir) and a brake cylinder operating a set of
brake rods and brake blocks.
In order to be available to work the brakes the air,
stored under pressure in the main reservoir, is allowed to pass
into the brake pipe, via the Driver's brake valve, and then into
a branch pipe to the triple valve, which latter device directs
it to an auxiliary reservoir, where it is held in readiness for
an application of the brakes.
When it is desired to apply the brakes the handle of
the Driver's brake valve is moved so that the flow of air from
the main reservoir to the brake pipe is stopped but, at the
same time, air already in the brake pipe is allowed to escape
to the atmosphere. The resultant reduction of pressure in the
brake pipe, affecting the like pressure in the branch pipe,
causes the triple valve to operate with the result that the air
pressure stored in the auxiliary reservoir is directed by this
valve into the brake cylinder, where it causes the brake cylinder
piston to move, and operate the brake rods, which latter then
force the brake blocks against the wheels. (The movement of
the triple valve in this way, however, cuts the auxiliary
reservoir off from any supply of air from the brake pipe, and


main reservoir of the engine, and this is a condition that
continues so long as the brakes are kept applied).
When the brakes have been applied sufficiently, and in
order, also, to hold them applied, the Driver's brake valve
handle is moved back a little so that the escape of air from
the brake pipe is halted, and when this occurs the triple valve
again functions automatically and causes the flow of air press-
ure from the auxiliary reservoir to the brake cylinder to be
stopped but, at the same time, the air that has already entered
the brake cylinder is held there.
To release the brakes, the Driver's brake valve handle
is moved back further again, so that air from the main reservoir
is allowed to flow into the brake pipe and branch pipe once more,
thus building up pressure there, causing the triple valve to
operate and allow the air in the branch pipe to flow into the
auxiliary reservoir again, which then replaces the air that had
formerly been transferred to the brake cylinder to apply the
brakes. At the same time, the air pressure in the brake
cylinder is permitted to escape to atmosphere, the brake
cylinder piston then being pushed back by the action of a spring,
and the brake shoes withdrawn from the wheels, thus releasing
the brakes.
So that an indication will be given of the air pressures
existing in various parts of the system, a duplex air pressure
gauge is fitted on the back of the boiler in the cab of the
engine. The red hand of this gauge indicates the main
reservoir air pressure, and the black hand the brake pipe press-
ure.
0
XI(J Positions of Driver's Brake Valve.
There are five positions (or notches) on the Driver's
brake valve, and each position controls a definite function of
the brake system, as follows:-
(a) Position for charging the brake pipe and the auxiliary
reservoirs, and for releasing the brakes^
This first position is obtained when the handle is
turned as far to the left as it will go. In this position
(full release) air from the main reservoir is allowed to pass
directly into the brake pipe and, if the handle is left there
indefinitely main reservoir pressure will be built up in the
brake pipe, and in the branch pipe and the auxiliary reservoirs
on the engine (and on any vehicles of the train, when there is
one attached).
Underneath the Driver's brake valve is an isolating
cock which must always be kept open to permit of air flowing
from the main reservoir to the brake pipe, except when another
engine is attached, in which latter case the isolating cock

TTS
must be closed on the engine that will be trailing in the
direction of running.
(b) Position Whilst Running.
When the brake valve handle is turned to its second,
or running position, (the next position when moving it to the
right of the position indicated in the foregoing) the air
flowing from the main reservoir is by-passed through a variable
pressure reducing valve (slide valve feed valve) before it
enters the brake pipe. This valve, depending on the setting,
will automatically stop the flow of air to the brake pipe when
any pressure below the main reservoir pressure that may be fixed
has been attained. This difference between main reservoir and
brake pipe pressure is necessary, (especially when operating
a long train) to ensure that, when releasing the brakes, all
the triple valves will respond promptly, and that after this,
the pressure in the auxiliary reservoirs will be restored
quickly, a sufficient surplus pressure of air by this means
being made available to make sure of effecting both these
purposes.
(c) Lap, or Holding Position.
This is the third position and, when the handle is
placed accordingly, all the passages in the Driver's brake valve
are closed, and whatever pressure was in the brake pipe before
the handle was placed in this position will be held there
(providing there are no leaks in the brake pipe, or in the brake
valve itself) until the handle is moved to another position.
(d) Position for Service Applications of the Brake.
This is the fourth, or service application position, and
in it the brake valve allows the air from the brake pipe to
escape to the atmosphere (via the equalising piston and valve,
which is situated on the right of the Driver's brake valve
proper).
The escape of air from, and reduction of pressure in,
the brake pipe in this manner causes the brakes to be applied,
in the way earlier described.
(e) Position for Emergency Application of the Brakes.
When the handle is turned as far to the right as it will
go, thus taking up the fifth, or emergency application position,
the brake pipe is connected through the Driver's brake valve
itself direct to the atmosphere, causing a very quick drop in
brake pipe pressure, which will result in the brakes being
applied as rapidly and fully as possible.


T=G

XZS Applying and Releasing the Air Brake (On a
Light fenglne)T
To make an application of the brakes, when moving a
light engine, (first being assured that the air compressor is
working, and that there is an adequate pressure of air in the
main reservoir, as shown by the air gauge) the following
movements of the Driver's brake valve require to be made:-
Ca) To Charge the Auxiliary Reservoirs of the Locomotive - place
the handle of the Driver's brake valve in the first, or full
release position, and charge the auxiliary reservoir on the
engine (and tender) to the main reservoir pressure. This is
done so that the maximum pressure will be available in the
auxiliary reservoirs to apply the brakes with full force in the
case of an emergency. The equalisation of pressure thus in
both the main reservoir and auxiliary reservoirs will be
indicated by both hands on the duplex pressure gauge (red and
black) showing the same, or nearly the same, pressure. (A
difference of 2F/i lbs, in the reading of the two hands is
allowable). The handle of the Driver's brake valve must be
left in this position all the time the locomotive is being moved
as a light engine with the brakes released.
(h) To apply the Brakes, move the handle (without pausing)
through the second and third positions to the fourth, or service
application, position. When this movement is made a blow of
air will be heard escaping from the brake pipe through the
equalising piston and valve, with the consequent reduction qf
pressure in same causing the brakes to be applied.
When it is felt that the brakes are applied hard enough
to slow, or stop, the locomotive, as may be required, the brake
valve handle should be returned to the third, or lap position,
which will cause the blow of air from the brake pipe to cease,
and no further brake force to be applied, but the brakes to be
held on.
Should it then be required to slow down, or stop, the
locomotive more quickly, the brake valve handle should again be
placed in the fourth, or service application position to apply
the brakes harder, and the handle returned to the lap position
when the required extra brake force has been secured in order
to hold the same applied.
To Apply the Brakes in Case of an Emergency the handle of
the brake valve should be swung straight round to the right, as
far as it will go, that is to the fifth, or emergency application
position. This will cause the brakes to be applied with the
maximum force in a minimum of time. The handle should be left
in this position until the locomotive has come to a stand.
(d) To Release the Brakes, return the brake valve handle to
the irst, or full release position, which will cause the brakes


to be released, and the auxiliary reservoirs also recharged with
air Ih readiness for the next application, for which latter
requirement (if a stop has been made) a few seconds should be
allowed to elapse before making another movement of the loco-
motive, to control which another brake application may be
required.
i B e Cylinder and Valve Chest Drain Valves.
Cylinder and Valve Chest Drain Valves are fitted to all
types of steam locomotives to allow any water that may have
accumulated, or be formed in these parts, to escape.
If this water is not allowed to escape, and the engine
is moved, the piston will be driven up against a solid mass of
water before it reaches the end of its stroke, with the
possible risk of damage to the cylinders, cylinder covers,
pistons and piston rods.
The drain valves are operated on engines, other than the
36, 38, 57, 59 and 60 classes, by rods connected to a lever which
is on the Driver's aide in the cab. When the lever is right
forward the valves are closed, and when it is right back the
valves are open. On 36, 38, 57 and 60 class locomotives, the
drain valves are operated by air pressure taken from the air
brake supply. They are controlled by a small handle, which
operates an air cock, and is located near the Driver's position
in the cab. When this handle is right forward the air is
exhausted from the air pipe, and the drain valves come open.
When it is right back the pipe is filled with air pressure,
which closes the valves. If there is no air pressure in the
system, of course, the drain valves will automatically remain
open. The drain valves on 59 class engines work on a similar
principle, except that steam instead of air is used in this way.
The operating valve, also, is controlled by a hand wheel on the
back of the boiler on the driver's side of the engine.
_JL_ Reversing Screw.
1-6
The reversing screw is for the purpose of controlling
the movement transmitted to the valves of the locomotive by the
valve gear, so that the valves may be made to assume the correct
positions to allow the admission of steam to the pistons for
either forward, or backward, running, as may be desired. It
is also the means whereby the point in the stroke of the pistons
at which the valves cut off the admission of live steam to the
cylinders, and then allow it to expand therein, may be varied.
Figure (1-6-3) shows a typical reversing screw assembly. When
the reversing screw wheel is turned in a clockwise direction
the reversing screw nut will move forward, and this movement is
transmitted through the reach rod, attached to the reversing
screw nut, and the valve gear, to the valves. When the revers-
1-6


T=E
ing screw nut reaches the end of the reversing screw bracket
the valves will be in the full forward position and, when the
steam regulator is opened, the locomotive will move forward.
To place the valves in the full backward position, the wheel
is turned in the anti-clockwise direction until the nut reaches
the other end of the reversing screw bracket. To place the
valves in the centre, or neutral, position the wheel should be
turned from the full forward to the full backward position, and
the number of turns counted. Then the wheel should be turned
half this number of turns in the forward direction to place the
valves in the centre position. In the positions intermediate
between either full forward, or full backward gear (as the case
may be) and centre gear, the point of cut off of supply of steam
to the cylinders will occur earlier in the piston stroke than
in either of the full gear positions.
When turning the reversing wheel to either the full
forward, or full backward, gear position the nut should not be
allowed to strike the reversing bracket hard, as it may damage
the screw and bracket, or become jammed. (Note - in the case
of 59 class engines, when the reversing screw wheel is turned
in the above mentioned directions forward or backward movement
of the locomotive will result as described, though the travel
of the reversing screw nut will be the opposite with these
engines to the same with other classes)
10
•j-g Regulator.
The regulator valve controls the admission of steam
from the boiler to the valve chests, and thence to the cylinders,
and is operated by a handle located on the boiler back casing
plate in a position convenient for the Driver to operate by his
right hand.
To lock the regulator handle in the shut position, when
the locomotive is stabled, a hole is provided in both the lever
and quadrant through which a locking pin can be inserted.
11
X—6 Precautions when about to move a Locomotive.
A Trainee Englneman (Acting Fireman), may, under
certain circumstances, be instructed to move an engine, but in
all cases he must first ensure that he will not endanger any
employee, or cause damage to the engine, or any equipment, by
taking the following precautions:—
(a) He must proceed around the engine and, verbally and clearly
warn any person working on the locomotive that it is
proposed to move it.
(b) Likewise, he must warn any employees working near by that
it is proposed to move the locomotive.


T=G
Reversing Screw.
Figure 3/1-6


(c) He must ascertain that no part of the locomotive, such as
connecting rods, valve gear, air brake equipment, etc., is
disconnected, or in such a position, or condition, that
damage of any kind will result from movement of the
locomotive.
(d) He must see that any converging roads are clear, any points
involved set in the right direction, and any turntable that
it may be proposed to use is properly positioned.
(e) Should a red flag, or light, be found placed on the
locomotive, it must not be moved until the employee who
placed the flag, or light, there has removed same, and has
indicated that it is safe to move the locomotive.
(f) Should the regulator, or reversing screw, be found secured
in, respectively, the closed, or the centre position, no
attempt should be made to move the locomotive until the
employee responsible for the securing of these parts has
either freed same, or Indicated that the locomotive may be
moved.
Blowing out Elements.
When a locomotive has been standing for some time with
the regulator closed the superheater elements, superheater header
steam pipes, valves and cylinders will become cold enough to
cause a large part of any steam that might have escaped into
these parts, or that might subsequently be admitted, to condense
therein.
The amount of water that can accumulate in this way is
often too great to be discharged through the cylinder drain
valves when the locomotive is moved, and may cause damage to the
cylinders, cylinder covers, pistons and piston rods, as previ-
ously outlined in Subject No. 8
To overcome this it is necessary, before moving a
locomotive, (and in the order of procedure set out in the next
instruction following herein) both to warm up the parts concern-
ed, and to clear out any accumulation of water by strongly
blowing boiler steam through them prior to moving the engine.
This is done in the following manner
Place the reversing gear in the centre position, with
not less than 50 lb. per square inch air pressure available
apply the air brakes fully, (on engines fitted with hand brake
also make sure the engine hand brake is hard on) and open the
cylinder and valve chest drain valves. Then open the regulator
fully for five (5) seconds, and close for a similar period;
repeating this operation three (3) times. After finally
closing the regulator, and when all escaping steam has been
1-6


T=G
discharged from the cylinders, move the reversing gear Into the
full forward, and then to the full backward position, so as to
allow all water to drain away through the open cylinder and
steam chest drain valves.
13
Procedure to be followed when actually moving the
Locomotive. "
Bearing in mind the requirements dealt with in the
foregoing, the following sets out the steps to be taken, in
sequence, when actually proceeding to move the locomotive
1. Warn all employees working on, or around, the locomotive
that it is now about to be moved.
2. Inspect the locomotive to ascertain that no parts of same
are disconnected, and that there will be no part of the
locomotive, or any nearby equipment, damaged if it be moved,
also that the brake pipe taps are closed at each end of
the locomotive.
3. Check converging roads (if there are any) and see that they
are clear, and that ho other locomotive is standing foul,
also that any points concerned are set in the correct
position for the movement intended, and that the switch
blades of same are properly home.
4. Inspect water levels in the boiler, and check conditions in
the interior of the firebox.
5. Start the Vestlnghouse Air Compressor, in the prescribed
manner, and raise the maximum Main Reservoir pressure that
can be obtained at the time from the available boiler
pressure. Check to see that the isolating cock is open,
and then charge the auxiliary reservoirs with the Driver's
brake valve in tjje full release position.
6. Apply the air brake (and engine hand brake, where, fitted)
and check to see that the cylinder and valve chest drain
valves are open.
7. Blow out the elements in the manner already described, then
place the reversing gear in the full forward, or full
backward gear, according to the direction of travel desired.
8. Call loudly, and clearly, the final verbal warning,
"All about engine N 0...." from both sides of the cab, await
any response, and, if there is no reply, check that the
road is still clear, and then -
9. Release the hand brake, (where fitted), blow the whistle,
release the air brake, and then open regulator sufficiently
to move the locomotive slowly, and take it carefully to the
point desired, keeping a good lookout while so doing.


T=B
14
Securing a Locomotive.
When the locomotive has been brought to a stand, and is
to remain stationary for any lengthy period, the procedure for
securing it is as follows
1. Fully apply the air brake, screw on the engine hand brake
(where fitted) and/or the tender brake, and then release
the air brake.
2. Place the reversing gear in centre position, and open the
cylinder and steam chest drain valves.
3. Secure the regulator by placing the locking pin in position.
4. Check the boiler water levels, and take any necessary steps
to ensure that the boiler will be left with a proper amount
of water in it.
5. Close all steam valves and nigger head valve (where
provided).
6. Where the locomotive is to be left unattended, as at an
Out Depot, close the boiler water gauge stop valves.
Checking Train Whilst Running.
At intervals during the journey the Fireman is required
to look back and observe the running of the train, especially
on right hand curves, and where his view is unobstructed.
When making a check of the train in this way the Fireman
should observe as follows
(a) Note that the train is complete. At night time this is
indicated by the presence of the white back lights of the
brake-van marker lights.
(b) Check that there is no indication of smoke arising from
any vehicle on the train, as this could indicate that a
bearing is overheated, or that a fire has started in, or
on, one of the vehicles of same. Brake block smoke,
however, should not be mistaken for an overheated axlebox,
or for a fire on a vehicle.
(c) Look for any indication of sparks being thrown from the
wheels of a vehicle, as this will indicate that a brake
is sticking, or that some part of one of the vehicles has
become disconnected, and is dragging along the permanent
way,
(d) Make sure that all doors on all the vehicles (either
Passenger or Goods) have been closed, and remain in the


closed position.
(e) When working Goods Trains, it should be noted that the
load on none of the vehicles has shifted. If any part
of the load is protruding beyond the load gauge it may
foul a train coming in the opposite direction. This
should be especially watched for in the case of high loads
such as hay, wool, timber, etc.
Should any of the abovementloned, or any other,
irregularity be observed the Fireman must notify the Driver
immediately.
16
Releasing Dragging Brakes.
When a Fireman is instructed by the Driver to go back
along the train, and release a brake on a vehicle that the
Driver suspects is dragging, the Fireman, after locating the
vehicle at fault, should adopt the following procedure in
ascertaining, and rectifying, the actual trouble causing same.
(a) Check Hand Brake.
Inspect the hand brake chain, and note whether it is
tight, or loose. If it is tight it will Indicate that the
handbrake is applied, and must be released.
On passenger vehicles and brake vans the Inside hand
brake must also be checked.
After releasing a hand brake, a test should always be
made to see that the brake blocks are free of the wheels. This
is done by pushing a convenient brake block with one foot to
ascertain whether it is free from contact with the wheels, or
not.
NOTE: When releasing a hand brake care should always be
exercised to take hold of the pawl in such a manner that
the spinning of the hand wheel will not injure the
forearm when the pawl is lifted.
(b) Brake Rigging Too Tight.
If, after releasing the hand brake, it is found that the
brake blocks are still applied to the wheels the position of the
brake cylinder piston rod should be noted.
If the rod is retracted it will indicate that the air
brake is released, and that air pressure is not the cause of the
brakes being held on.
Under these circumstances a check of the brake rigging
and wheels should be made, to ascertain if the brake rigging has
T^>


been taken up too tight, or if there is scale built up on the
surface of the wheels. Should either of these latter conditions
be found to be the cause of the brakes dragging the Fireman
should return to the locomotive, and advise the Driver of the
circumstances, as it is the Driver's duty to adjust the brake
rigging.
(c) Releasing Overcharged Auxiliary Reservoir.
Should the brakes fall to release after the hand brake
has been disengaged, and it is noted that the brake cylinder
piston rod is extended', the trouble may be due to an overcharged
auxiliary reservoir causing the brakes to remain applied, or to
a sluggish triple valve having the same effect.
When the auxiliary reservoir pressure is higher than
the brake pipe pressure, the triple valve will be held in the
applied position, as it also will if it is slow to respond to
the reverse pressure condition. To cause the brakes to release
in either case it is necessary to reduce the air pressure in the
auxiliary reservoir well below that in the brake pipe, by
operating the hand release valve. When this has been done the
higher pressure then in the brake pipe will cause the triple
valve to function, and move to the release position, after which
the air pressure in the brake cylinder should escape, the brake
piston rod should retract, and the brakes release.
(d) Faulty Grade Control Valve.
If, with a goods vehicle fitted with a grade control
valve, after both the hand brake and auxiliary reservoir have
been dealt with as described the brakes still fail to release,
the trouble may be caused by a defective grade control valve,
and action must then be taken thus
1. If the handle of the grade control valve is in the Holding
Position (HP) or one inch to either side of the Normal
Exhaust Position (EX) a pressure of air will be retained in
the brake cylinder and, in order to release this air, the
handle should be turned to the Intermediate Position (IP).
2. If the handle is, or has been put, in the Intermediate
Position (IP) and the brakes are still not releasing, the
trouble may be that the ports in the grade control valve
are blocked in this position, and the handle should then be
turned to the Exhaust Position (EX), when, if the valve is
not defective in this position also, a blow of air at the
exhaust port will be heard, and the brakes should release.
3. When neither of the above tests succeeds in releasing the
brakes, the grade control valve must be considered defective,
and the brakes on the vehicle must then be cut out.


T=E
(e) Faulty Triple Valve.
A triple valve that is so seriously defective that it
will not function to release the brakes by the use of the hand
release valve can, of course, be a cause of the brakes dragging,
but, on a vehicle having a grade control valve, it will be
difficult for the Fireman to determine whether in such a case
the triple valve, or the grade control valve, is actually at
fault. However, in either case the brakes will have to be cut
out.
(f) Vehicles not fitted with Grade Control Valves.
In the case of goods and passenger type vehicles not
fitted with grade control valves, a check of the hand brakes,
brake rigging, and auxiliary reservoir, as Indicated earlier
herein, should be made, and, if the brakes still do not release,
then in such a case also resort must be had to cutting the brake
out,
17
Cutting Out Brakes.
The cutting out of a brake should be done by first
closing the Isolating cock on the branch pipe leading from the
brake pipe to the triple valve, l.e. the handle of the Isolating
cock must be turned at right angles to the pipe.
After dosing this isolating cock ALL the air should be
drained from the auxiliary reservoir by holding the hand release
valve open, after which the releasevalve must be secured in the
open position. A check should then be made that no brake block
is pressing against any of the wheels.
After cutting out a brake on a vehicle during a journey
the Fireman must obtain from the Driver an "Air Brake Defective"
card, and place it in the consignment clip of the vehicle.
18
Brake Pipe Leakage.
When a bad leak occurs in the brake pipe, or in any of
its connections, the automatic feature of the Westinghouse Air
Brake will operate, causing the brakes to be applied, and if
the 'loss of air pressure resulting is sufficient the brakes will
be applied fully, and the train brought to a stand. A leakage
of this severity can be caused in a number of ways and, when
occurring, the cause must be found. With this object in view
it is the Fireman's duty in such an event to proceed back along
the train and, when so doing, he should take with him the
following equipment, viz. screw wrench, combined coal pick and
hand hammer, flat chisel, spare air hose, (where no spare is
supplied in the back box, or if in the electrified area, and
access cannot be had to the back box, take the hose from the


T^S
front of the locomotive) and at night take the hand signal lamp.
Equipped thus, the Fireman will be in a position to deal with
any of the following defects
(a) Uncoupled Air Hose.
When it is found that two adjoining air hoses have
become disconnected from one another the Fireman should close
the air tap on each vehicle concerned, reconnect the air hoses,
and then open both these air taps again.
After connecting the hoses an examination should be made
to try and determine the cause of the air hoses having become
disconnected, in case the same thing happens again.
(b) Burst Air Hoses.
In the event of an air hose on a vehicle having burst,
the following procedure should be adopted -
1. Close both air taps on the adjoining ends of the vehicles
where the trouble has occurred, and remove the burst hose.
2. Renew the burst air hose, connect up, and open both the air
taps concerned again.
3. The defective air hose, and the number of the vehicle to
which it was fitted, must then be given to the Driver.
(c) Broken Brake, or Branch, Pipe.
1. When it is found that the cause of a leakage is a break
in a branch pipe, and this is located between the isolating
cock and the triple valve, the isolating cock handle should
be closed, and the brakes cut out (as previously explained
in Subject No. 17).
2. In the case of a broken brake pipe, (or a broken branch
pipe between the brake pipe and the Isolating cock) the
Fireman must note the exact nature of the trouble, then
return to the locomotive, and inform the Driver accordingly.
(d) Emergency Whistle Valve.
When, on a passenger train, the Fireman finds that the
cause of a brake pipe leakage is due to the passenger emergency
whistle valve having been operated, he should remember that it
is the duty of the Guard (or Conductor, if in attendance), to
ascertain the reason why the emergency cord had been used, and
ultimately to re-set it. If there is no Conductor, and only
one Guard on duty on the train, and a delay is anticipated, the
Fireman must carry out the Guard's duties in respect to the
protection of the train (as outlined in Rule 243 Clause J)


leaving the Guard to attend to the matter of the use of the
emergency whistle.
Break Aways.
In the event of a train becoming divided, with damage to
the drawgear involved,, the Driver and Guard will confer, and
decide whether the quickest way to clear the section is (a) to
repair the damaged drawgear, or (b) to tow the damaged vehicle
to the nearest siding, and then return for the rest of the
train.
The methods of repairing, and of towing a vehicle, and
the safe working regulations which must be observed, are fully
described under separate headings in the Book of Rules and
Regulations, and the appropriate parts of the General Appendices
As a guide to the Fireman in respect of the duties
involved, however, the following steps, setting out the sequence
in which the complete operations which must be carried out by
the train crew to effect either of the above decisions, are
described below, and the Driver will instruct the Fireman as to
which of the duties he will require him to perform.
(a) Repairing Damaged Drawgear.
1. Secure the rear portion of the train with hand brakes, and
sprags, where necessary.
2. Close the air tap on the rear end of the front portion of
the train.
3. Driver and Guard confer.
4. Protect the rear portion of the train, when required, in
accordance with the regulations.
5. Repair, or replace, damaged drawgear component.
6. Recouple both portions of the train, connect air hoses, and
open the air tap on each adjoining end of the two vehicles
where coupling has been done making sure they have both
Ueen fully opened.
7. By whistle, recall the Guard, if he is protecting the rear
of the train.
8. Collect any damaged, or broken parts, and record the number
of the vehicle from which they were taken.
9. Make continuity test of the air brake system.
10. Receive, and acknowledge, the Guard's right way, and resume
journey.
1-6


T=S
(b) Refuging a Damaged Vehicle.
1. Secure the rear portion of the train with hand brakes, and
sprags, where necessary.
2. Close the air tap on the rear of the front portion of the
train.
3. Driver and Guard confer and, if necessary, make out Guard's
order authorising return later to the rear portion of the
train.
4. Protect the rear portion of the train, when required, and
in accordance with the regulations.
5. If the damaged vehicle has to be detached from the rear
portion of the train, bring the two portions together.
6. Uncouple the damaged vehicle from the rear portion, and
close air tap on the rear end of it.
7. Effect temporary coupling between the damaged vehicle and
the front portion of the train, connect the air hoses
between it and the front portion, and then open fully the
air tap at each adjoining end of the two vehicles which
have thus been temporarily coupled together.
8. Check, and make sure that the air brake on the damaged
vehicle is operative as, except the air brake on this
vehicle be fully operative, it must not be hauled at the
end of the train by a temporary coupling.
9. Collect damaged parts, if possible, note number of damaged
vehicle, and make continuity test of the air brake system.
10. Release hand brakes, and remove sprags (if applied) on the
damaged vehicle.
11. If in the hours of darkness place a red, or white light (as
directed by the Driver) on the front of the rear portion of
the train. Draw the front portion of the train ahead far
enough for detonators to be placed ahead of the rear portion,
as required by the regulations.
12. The front portion of the train should now be ready to
proceed, and the Fireman should, if practicable, ride on
the damaged vehicle, or, if not, on the nearest vehicle to
it on which it is practicable for him to ride. When
proceeding, any catch points, or any other potential source
of danger which may exist en route, must be noted, and
protected by detonators, according to the regulations.
13. On arrival at the Home Signal at the station, or signal box
next in advance, the locomotive must be stopped, and the
Fireman then proceeds to the station, or signal box, and


Tiff
acquaints the Station Master or Signalman of the
circumstances, prior to the Driver bringing the train under
the protection of the signals.
14. The stowing of the defective vehicle, and front portion of
the train, is then carried out under the direction of the
Traffic staff, following which, after conferring with the
Station Master, or Signalman, and on the authority of the
Guard's order, the locomotive may return on the same line
for the remainder of the train, or else other arrangements
will be made for dealing with the latter, instructions for
which will be given to the Driver by the Station Master,
or Signalman.
15. If return is made to the train, upon reaching it the Guard
should then be recalled by the use of the whistle.
16. While the Guard is returning, the locomotive should be
coupled to the second portion of the train in the usual
manner by the Fireman, care being taken to open fully the
air taps on the locomotive (or tender) and the leading
end of the first vehicle of the train when the air hoses
have been connected.
17. Then if a light has been affixed, it should be removed from
the first vehicle.
18. Hand brakes should then be released, and sprags (if applied)
removed.
19. The Guard, having returned to the rear brake van, must make
a continuity test of the air brake system therefrom.
20. Then, on receipt of the Guard’s right way, the train may go
forward through the section,
NOTE: Trainee Enginemen are reminded that they should continu-
ally refresh their memories with regard to the safe
working regulations applying, and the methods of dealing
with vehicles with damaged drawgear so that, when called
upon to assist in such cases as have been outlined, they
will be able to do so with the least possible delay, and
ensure the safe and efficient conduct Of all the
operations involved.
. 2 9 Emergency Coupling.
1-6
When it is required to couple a locomotive fitted with
a hook, to a vehicle which is bufferless and which is fitted
with an automatic coupling, it will be necessary to use an
emergency coupling (Figure 1-6—4) for this purpose. In this
connection it should be noted that emergency couplers are kept
in the brake van of all air-conditioned trains, and also at
certain station vantage points in the electrified area.


ITS
Emergency Coupling.
Figure 4/16
When attaching the emergency coupler the following
procedure should be adopted
1. Open the knuckle of the automatic coupling.
2. Attach the emergency coupler to the automatic coupler on the
angle, and insert the appropriate locking pin in the hole
provided for it for the purpose of securing the emergency
coupler to the knuckle of the automatic coupler.
3. Swing the emergency coupler round so as to close the
knuckle on the automatic coupling, also note that the
locking pin of the latter falls into position.


TTS
4. Remove the pin from the shackle on the emergency coupler,
and then place this shackle over the hook to which it is
desired to couple.
5. Ease up with the locomotive until the hook has entered the
recess provided on the emergency coupler.
6. Lift the eye of the shackle so that the shackle pin can be
inserted through the eye and the slot provided in the
emergency coupler, then secure with the safety cotter.
7. Where necessary, insert the small pins (which are to be
found attached by chains to the emergency coupler) on each
side of the draw hook, to prevent any lateral movement.
8. Connect the jumper air hose which accompanies the emergency
coupler to the air hose of the locomotive and vehicle.
9. Finally, open both air taps.
. 2 .j. Vehicle on Fire.
1-6
Should it be observed, when working a train, that a
vehicle in it is on fire the train must be stopped as quickly
as possible and, after securing the rear portion, the burning
vehicle must be uncoupled from the latter, and drawn forward
at least 50 yds. There it must be uncoupled from the front
portion (or from the locomotive, if next to same) and left
properly secured, in accordance with Rules 243 and 253.
However, should the heat from the fire be such that uncoupling
the burning vehicle itself would be hazardous, the detaching
operations should be carried out at a vehicle, or vehicles, as
close on any side of the burning vehicle as is possible.
, 22 Securing Detonators to Rail.
I—6
Care must be taken when handling detonators, as there
is a possibility that, if handled roughly, they may explode,
and cause serious injury. This applies especially when
attaching detonators to the rail.
The procedure to be adopted when securing a detonator
to the rail should be as follows
1. Loosen the lead clasps from the top of the detonator.
2. Place the flat casing of the detonator carefully on the top
of the rail.
3. Bend the lead clasps down, and turn under the head of the
rail, and press against same tightly to secure.


TIS
4. Detonators should always be placed on that rail over which,
with a following train, the Driver of the latter would
normally be riding, except in electrified areas, where the
detonators should be placed on the right hand rail in the
direction of travel, that is, not on the Driver's side.
To indicate to employees using tricycles that detonators
are in position (and so that they may not explode them, with
possible injury to themselves resulting) a piece of white paper
should be folded to the approximate width of the rail, and one
end clamped between the detonator and the rail, with the long
end of the paper then turned up so that at least three inches
of paper stands vertically, and can thus be seen by anyone
approaching.
T~§ Changing the Train Staff.
On single lines of railway a Driver is not authorised
to enter a Section ahead from a block station, unless he is in
possession of the Train Staff applying to that Section, or else
of an authority in lieu of the Train Staff. The possession of
either of these assures him that no train will be allowed to
enter the Section from the other end.
At each block station, therefore, the Train Staff has to
be changed, the one applying to the Section which the train is
leaving being given up to the proper Traffic Branch Officer,
who will receive it, and the one applying to the Section ahead
being obtained' from the same Officer before proceeding into
that Section.
Generally, the Staff exchanging will be carried out by
hand, but where the necessary ground equipment is installed,
and the corresponding apparatus fitted on the locomotive, it
may be done by automatic mechanical means. It is the duty of
the Fireman to effect this Staff exchanging requirement and,
according to circumstances, it will be done from the locomotive
either after it has stopped, just before stopping, or when
running through the Station (or passing the Signal Box) at an
appropriate speed,
(a) Exchanging By Hand.
There are two methods of changing the Staff by hand,
according to the type of Train Staff concerned, and these are
fully described in Part 11 of the General Appendix, page 132,
and the Trainee Engineman, or Fireman, is advised to study
these instructions and familiarise himself with the procedure
in each case to be adopted.
Incidentally, where changing the Staff by hand on the
'3B', 's7' and 's9' class locomotives, on which no supporting
hand rail is provided on the tender footplate, the operation


T=s
should be carried out from the cab windows of the locomotive.
It should also be borne in mind that it is required of the
Trainee Englneman, or Fireman, that when he receives the new
Staff he clearly inform the Driver of the section to which it
applies.
(b) Exchanging by Automatic Staff Exchanger.
When operating the Automatic Staff Exchanger the
Trainee Engineman, or fireman, should adopt the following
procedure
1. Have the fire, boiler pressure and boiler water levels
approaching the point where the Staff exchanging will be
carried out in such a condition that he will be free to
operate the exchanger without requiring to attend to any
of these matters.
2. Before the Staff, with its sling, is inserted in the
Exchanger the indication of the Distant Signal (or Accept
Signal, as the case may be) should be observed, the oppor-
tunity being taken to do this as soon as it is possible to
sight this signal.
If the Distant (or Accept) signal is observed to be in
the Clear position the Fireman should at once insert the
sling, with the back of the leather pouch facing towards
the rear of the train, in the gunmetal receptacle beneath
the spring clip, with the ring standing vertical and square
with the side of the locomotive (or tender) and held firmly
by the spring loaded clip. (Should the Distant (or Accept)
signal either not be in the Clear position, or cleared on
reaching same, the procedure set out in Clause 5 herein is
to be followed.)
3. Immediately after passing the Home signal the Fireman should
quickly lower the Exchanger into the exchanging position,
care being exercised to ensure that it comes to rest
correctly placed, but at the same time avoiding any Jerky
action and final violent contact with the supporting, or
stop, bracket.
4. After the exchange has been made the Exchanger must be
returned to its running position as promptly as circumstances
permit (excepting where the ground Exchanger is located in
the six foot, and another train is standing on an adjacent
road, in which case the Exchanger should not be returned
until clear of the other train) and the Staff removed from
it. The Driver should then be informed of the section to
which the Staff applies, after which the Staff, in its
sling, should be safely secured inside the cab,
5. Should the Distant (or Accept) signal be observed to be in
the caution position the Fireman should place the sling in
the receptacle in the usual manner, but should not attempt
to lower the exchanger, until the Driver has been able to


T=G
determine whether the position of the signals ahead will
permit him to run past the ground exchanger at a rate of
more than 20 miles per hour, below which speed the
exchanger does not operate efficiently. If it is found
that it will not be possible to exceed this speed the
sling should be withdrawn from the receptacle, and
arrangements made to stop at the exchanging point, and the
staff then exchanged by hand.
24
Authority for Enginemen to Travel.
When Enginemen are required to travel passenger in the
course of their duty the regulations laid down on page 326 of
the General Appendix, Part 1, must be adhered to, and the
Trainee Engineman, or Fireman, is advised to familiarise
himself with these regulations so as to avoid any difficulties
with the Traffic Branch staff, and the possibility of failing
to arrive on time at the point of duty.

-jiy Introduction.
On the larger types of locomotives, such as the AD.6O
Class, it would be impossible for a Fireman to supply coal to
the firebox at the rate required to maintain the requisite
boiler pressure to work the locomotive efficiently, and to haul
a heavy train. Therefore a mechanical stoker is fitted.
Through the agency of this device the coal in the tender (or
bunker) of the locomotive is conveyed, by means of a power
operated screw conveyor, to a distributing table located inside
the firebox, from where it is distributed over the firegrate by
steam jets.
2
—■= Description of a Mechanical Stoker -
AD.6O Class Locomotive.
The mechanical stoker fitted to the AD.6O Class loco-
motives is the Standard Stoker Company’s H.T. type, shown in
Figures (1-7-1) and (1-7-2), herewith, and consists of the
following parts:-
(a) Tender (or Coal Bunker) Conveyor Unit.
The tender (or coal bunker) conveyor unit is rigidly
secured to the bottom of the coal bunker, and consists of a
trough, a conveyor screw therein, and a crusher.
The coal falls by gravity into the conveyor trough
through openings which can be either closed, or opened, by
sliding plates which, when closed, form the bottom floor of
the sloping coal bunker, and that work in guides which are
formed as a part of the trough.
A crusher, (see 1072 C, Figure 1-7-2) located at the
forward end of the trough, breaks the larger lumps of coal to
a proper firing size, while permitting the smaller lumps to be
conveyed through the crushing zone without further breaking.
(b) Intermediate Conduits.
The intermediate unit consists of two telescopic
conduits, one flexibly connected to the tender (or bunker)
trough, and the other to the elevator pipe, by ball and socket
joints. The screw within the conduits is connected by
universal flexible joints, at one end to the tender conveyor,
and at the other to the elevator conveyor screw. This
construction provides for sufficient flexibility between the

for the sharpest line curvature over which the locomotive may
pass; and also for any necessary up and down movement between
the parts concerned.
(c) Elevator Pipe.
The elevator pipe and its screw are connected with the
intermediate unit and its screw Just beneath the cab deck.
From this point the elevator pipe extends upwards, through the
deck, and its upper end conforms to the contour of the lower
half of the fire hole door opening.
(d) Distributing Unit.
The distributing unit is made up of:-
1. The distributing Jet casting (See 6, Figure 1-7-3) which
is fastened to the elevator pipe by two bolts, and is
provided with steam Jet holes of appropriate diameter and
angularity for distributing the coal. These holes are
arranged so that they can be operated in five separate
groups for serving different sections of the firebox, the
steam supply to each group being controlled by its own
valve placed on the jet manifold in the cab of the
locomotive.
2, The distributing table (See 7, Figure 1-7-3) is located
under the distributing jets, and is held in position by
two pins. The deflecting ribs on the top surface of the
distributing table, in conjunction with the distributor

of the elevator pipe, provide for sufficient flexibility
in operating control to permit of coal being distributed
to any desired part of the firebox.
In order to protect the distributing table from over-
heating, cooling air is admitted between the elevator pipe
and the bottom of the fire hole door opening, and is then
deflected against the under side of the table by means of
an apron (See 29254, Figure 1-7-1) which is fastened to
the skirt of the table, and fitted against the firebox
backplate.
(e) Stoker Engine and Reversing Valve.
The screw conveyor is driven by a double acting, two
cylinder, reversible steam engine (See 1501, Figure 1-7-2).
All working parts of this engine are completely enclosed, the
crankshaft, and associated parts, being lubricated by the splash
system from the engine sump. A Nathan mechanical lubricator,
driven,from the flywheel, provides the lubrication for the
valves and pistons of the stoker engine.
The steam supply to the latter is controlled by two
valves located in the cab of the locomotive. One, the stoker
steam valve, is arranged on a small bypass pipe large enough
to supply sufficient steam to the stoker engine for normal
working, while the other, the stoker booster valve, is placed
on the main steam pipe to the stoker engine, and is used to
boost the supply of steam to this engine should a large piece
of coal become caught in the crusher.


T=7
_ 3 _ Functions of Distributing Unit.
1-7
Before a Fireman can control the mechanical stoker in
the way necessary to secure even distribution of coal over the
firebed it will be desirable for him to have a clear under-
standing of the functions of each part of the distributing unit.
These parts, and their functions, are as follows
(a) Delivery of Coal.
The conveyor screw, revolving in the trough, picks up
the coal that passes to it through the openings from the coal
bunker and, carrying it forward, any large lumps contained are
driven against the crusher projections, which latter break them
up to proper firing size. Thence the coal travels, under the
action of the screw, up the elevator pipe and, from Figure
(1-7—3), it will be seen that the screw (4), then forces it
from the circular elevator pipe out on to the flat, inclined
surface of the distributor jet casting, (6), which is located
above the holes for the steam jets therein, and thence there
flows a wide, flat stream of coal on to the distributing table
(7) below, and in front of the jets.
(b) Control over the Width of the Stream of Coal.
Means for controlling the width allowed for this stream
of coal is made by the provision of the two adjustable vanes
(2), located on either side of the elevator pipe, and sliding
on the inclined surface of the distributor casting. Each vane
is independently adjustable, and the two together- may be set to
give either a wide, or a narrow, stream of coal, as desired, or
they may be adjusted so that the stream is deflected more to
one side than the other.
(c) Control of the Quantity of Coal.
The quantity of coal which will be delivered in any
given period of time is controlled by the speed of the conveyor
screw which, in turn, is governed by the speed of the stoker
engine, and this can be varied by the amount of steam admitted
by the control valve.
(d) Purpose of Distributing Table.
The distributing table (7), is provided so that the
accumulating pieces of coal, delivered to the firebox by the
screw conveyor, will have a platform on which they can lodge,
and remain for a short period of time in the path of the steam
jets. It thus provides a fixed and central firing table
supporting the coal at a predetermined height above the fire
grates, from which vantage point it may be shot by the action
of the steam jets playing upon it, and be directionally guided,
while at the same time receiving the required momentum to

enable it to be distributed over the whole of the firebed.
In addition, the table is provided with five guiding
ribs which assist the steam jets in the distribution of the
coal.
(e) Arrangement of Distributing Jets.
Twelve holes, each 3/16" in diameter, drilled in the
distributor casting, are used to form the steam distributing
jets (6). These holes are arranged in two horizontal rows,
eight in the bottom row, and four in the top, and are drilled


I=7
at angles to the longitudinal centre line of the firebox which
are approximately the same as those of the ribs on the distri-
buting table between which they are located, as shown in
Figure (1-7-3).
As has already been stated the twelve jets are arranged
so that they can be operated in five separate groups, the steam
supply to each group being controlled by a steam valve for each
in the cab of the locomotive (as shown in Figure 1-7-4). The
operation and purpose of each group is described in the
following:-
1. The steam to the two left hand holes in the bottom row is
controlled by the steam valve (1) and the steam jets
discharging from these holes (in conjunction with the
corresponding curved rib on the distributing table) direct
the supply of coal to the left back corner of the firebox
2. The steam to the two right hand holes in the bottom row is
controlled by the steam valve (5) and the steam jets
discharging from these holes, (in conjunction with the
corresponding curved deflecting rib on the distributing
table) direct the supply of coal to the right back corner
of the firebox.
3. The steam to the four centre holes in the bottom row is
controlled by the fine coal control valve (3) and the steam
jets from these (together with the three straight ribs on
the distributing table) direct the supply of coal to the
left and right sides, and to the left and right front,
portions of the firegrate.
4. The steam to the two left hand holes in the top row of jets
is controlled by the steam valve (2) and these jets assist
(if required) in the distribution of coal to the left front
and side of the firegrate.
5. The steam to the two right hand holes on the top row of
jets is controlled by the steam valve (4) and these jets
assist (if required), in the distribution of coal to the
right front and side of the firegrate.
Steam pressure gauges are provided in the cab, items
(7), (8) and (9), to indicate the pressure of steam being
delivered to the left and right front (per valves 2 and 4,
respectively) and to the fine coal (per valve 3) sets of Jets.
No gauges, however, are provided for the left and right back
jets, (supplied with steam per valves 1 and 5, respectively.
4 Preparing the Fire.
TT7
(a) Lighting the Fire.
The procedure to be adopted when lighting a fire in a


T=7
stoker equipped locomotive is the same as that for a hand fired
locomotive, and is as described in Subject No. 2
However, care must be taken not to allow coal to collect
on top of, or to bank around, the distributing table. Unless
this precaution is taken the life of the table will be
materially shortened.
(b) Spreading and Building the Fire.
This should also be done in the same way as on a hand
fired locomotive, as outlined in Subject No. 5 herein, and
1-4
using the shovel to supply the coal. If the stoker is used
at this stage the firebed will be made up of a quantity of fine
and small coal, which will form a very closely packed firebed,
and subsequently cause poor steaming when starting away with
the train. Also, the outgoing Fireman will not be able to
test the stoker equipment satisfactorily.
5
Preparation of Stoker Equipment.
In addition to the preparation details outlined for
hand firing in Part 1, Section 3, herein, the following
additional duties must be carried out by the Fireman when
preparing a locomotive fitted with a mechanical stoker.
(a) Lubrication.
1. The compartment oil box, located on the left side of the
coal bunker, supplies the lubricant necessary for the drive
shaft and gear box bearings, and should be filled with
loco, bearing oil.
2. The universal joints and slip joint of the drive shaft
between the stoker engine and gear box should also be
oiled with locc, bearing oil.
3. The oil level in the sump of the stoker engine should be
checked by withdrawing the dip stick. Replenish the oil
level to the full mark with loco, bearing oil, if required.
4. The oil level in the reservoir of the mechanical lubricator,
provided for the lubrication of the stoker engine val/es
and pistons, should also be checked by withdrawing the dip
stick.
Replenish to the full mark with cylinder oil, if required.
(b) Testing Stoker Engine.
The operation of the stoker engine and screw conveyor
should be tested. First open the main steam valve to the
stoker equipment, (See Figure I—7—4) and then place the stoker


TI7
reversing valve in the forward position (handle pulled right
up). Next, open the stoker steam valve slowly to permit the
cylinders to heat up, and any condensation to escape. Note
that the fly wheel of the engine and the screw conveyor are
revolving, and that the speed of same changes whenever the
setting of the steam valve is altered.
Next, test the stoker booster valve by pressing the
handle right down. This should cause the stoker engine
Immediately to speed up.
Note that the conveyor screw is operating throughout
its entire length by observing its movement through the three
peep holes (See 3 in Figure 1-7-3) in the top portion of the
elevator pipe. If it is not revolving at this point it will
indicate that the screw is either broken, or that one of the
screw universal joint links has become uncoupled.
The stoker engine should then be tested in the reverse
direction by placing the stoker reversing valve in the backward
position, (handle pushed hard down) and again noting the move-
ment of the stoker engine flywheel and screw conveyor when the
stoker steam valve is opened.
The steam pressure under which the stoker engine is
functioning is indicated by the stoker engine steam gauge, it
being shown by the large hand of the left hand duplex pressure
gauge, (See 6, Figure 1-7-4). This should not show more than
10 lb. to 15 lb. per square inch under normal operating
conditions. If a higher pressure is indicated notify the
Driver, as there may be a defect that requires attention.
(c) Testing the Distributor.
To test the distributing jets the main jet valve
(Figure 1-7-4) should be opened to supply steam to the manifold.
Then open, and close, each jet control valve (1, 2,3, 4 and 5
in Figure 1-7-4) in turn, and note that there is a full jet of
steam Issuing from each set of holes while the appropriate valve
is open. Should any of the jets appear to be defective, (i.e.
blocked jets, or a fractured casting allowing steam to blow out
of more than one set of jets at a time) it must be reported
immediately for attention by the mechanical staff.
The main jet valve should then be closed, and all jet
control valves opened a half turn. A check should then be
made (the main jet valve being kept closed) to see that a small
amount of steam is issuing from the jets. Should this not be
the case it will indicate that the pilot hole in the main jet
valve is blocked, and the matter should be reported for
attention, as a small amount of steam passing through the jets
is required to keep the jet casting cool, even though the main
jet valve may have been shut down.

The condition of the distributing table should also be
examined and, if found to be so badly burned away around the
front corners, or so badly warped that the distribution of coal
to any of the points desired will be seriously impaired, it
should be reported for replacement.

-j—y Stoker Operation.
Operating the Stoker, and Setting the Jets.
1. Pull the first of the slides covering the tender conveyor
trough to allow coal in the bunker to feed to the conveyor
screw. A slide hook is provided for this purpose, and
care should be taken to see that the hook is properly in
position in the hole in the slide, and the feet correctly
braced, before applying the sometimes appreciable force
necessary to move the slide.
2. Fully open the main steam valve, and the main jet valve
(See Figure 1-7-4) to the stoker equipment, and then open
the fine coal control valve (3) until approximately 10 lb
per square inch pressure shows on the large hand of the
right hand duplex pressure gauge (7). Also open the left
and right back control valves (1 and 5, respectively) a
quarter of a turn each.
3. Place the stoker reversing valve in the forward position,
and open the stoker steam valve until the conveyor screw
begins to turn slowly.
4. When the coal commences to be delivered at the distributor,
open the flrehole door, and observe the distribution of the
coal over the firebed. Then adjust the pressure of steam
to the left and right back jets (valves 1 and 5, respect-
ively) to make the lighter pieces of coal reach the Inside
firebox wrapper plate, and finally adjust the steam press-
ure to the fine coal jets (valve 3) to obtain an even
distribution over the rest of the firebed but, at the same
time, taking care not to allow the pressure to become so
high that the coal will form a bank against the firebox
tube plate.
5. Due to the action of the screw conveyor there is a tendency
to deliver more coal to the right side of the distributing
table than to the left, and it is, therefore, usually
necessary to adjust the vanes so as to give, by their
action, an even distribution of coal to both sides of the
firebox. It will generally be found that good distribution
can be achieved by placing the controlling handle of the
right vane in a forward position, and the handle of the
left vane in a backward position.
6. Should it be found that the distribution of coal over a
portion of the firebed served by the fine coal jets is
uneven, due *to one, or more, of the jet holes being
defective, either the left, or the right, front jets, as
the case may be, cun be turned on (valves 2 and 4, respect-
ively) to assist the defective jet in the distribution of
coal to the portion where the firebed is lightest, so that
an even distribution can be attained. Otherwise, these


T=7
jets need, generally, not be used.
7. Attention is drawn to the fact that the rate at which the
coal is delivered to the distributing table is also
important in attaining an even distribution of coal over
the firegrate for a given pressure setting of the Jets.
Thus, should the Jets be set at a low pressure, and the
stoker engine then at some time raced, the quantity of
coal being delivered will be so great that the jets will
not be able to distribute all of it, with this resulting
in much of the coal falling short of the required mark,
and a large bank will then be formed around the
distributing table.
It should, therefore, be understood that,while the
pressure to the various jets must be set, from time to
time it may need to be varied, so that they will be capable
of evenly distributing the varying amount of coal which
will be required to maintain full boiler pressure, and so
satisfactorily to haul the train concerned over the
different grades encountered throughout the journey.
7
Maintaining the Fire Throughout the Journey.
Light firing, with, as far as possible, a constant flow
of coal, and an even distribution to cover the entire surface of
the firebed, will produce the highest combustion efficiency.
Heavy firing, or racing the stoker intermittently, leads to
incomplete combustion, improper fire conditions, clinkered
fires, excessive black smoke, and waste of coal.
Handling of the grates in connection with stoker firing
is an important factor. Grates should not be rocked heavily
while the locomotive is working hard, on account of the light
firebed usually carried with stoker firing. They should be
moved gently, a few strokes at a time, but as frequently as may
be necessary, depending on the type of coal in use, to keep the
ash accumulation underneath the firebed down to a point where
it will not interfere with the free and uniform flow of air
necessary for complete combustion. If it is desired to shake
the grates heavily to dispose of an excessive accumulation of
ash, or clinker formation, it should be done while the locomotive
is standing, or drifting, or at places where the locomotive is
being worked lightly, and the maximum boiler pressure is not
required to handle the train. Tt will be appreciated that
holes in the fire are apt to form from too heavy a shaking of
the grates while the locomotive is working hard and, in many
instances, are the cause of steam failures before the Fireman
can locate the hole, and stop the inrush of cold air.
Occasionally, conditions are encountered which necessi-
tate re-adjustment of the distributing devices, in order to
maintain a proper distribution of the coal. Some of these
conditions are: changes In the class and weight of coal in use;


TT7
in the condition of the coal, wet or dry; in the thickness
of the firebed; and any considerable change in the combustion
rate, or in the draft operating, caused by wide variations of
the regulator and/or reversing screw positions. Therefore,
frequent inspection of fire conditions, and of the distribution
of the coal that is occurring, is advisable. By such the
Fireman will be enabled to take timely action to correct any
improper condition that may be in the formative stage, and that
can be remedied in time by a slight adjustment of the
distributing jet control valves. Generally, if one adheres to
principles applying in good hand firing practice success in
stoker firing will likewise be obtained.
Removing Obstruction.
If the stoker stalls, in nearly all instances an
obstruction will be found at the crusher (located in the tender
trough). An indication tfrat the stoker has stopped will be
given by the pointer on the stoker steam gauge rising practi-
cally to boiler pressure, and remaining stationary thereat.
To relieve the obstruction, reverse the stoker engine
by placing the operating lever of the reversing valve in the
reverse position. If, after repeated reversals, however, the
stoker will not operate normally it is an indication that the
obstruction is too large, or too hard, to pass through the
crusher. To remove such a clog at the crusher, reverse the
stoker, in the manner previously described, thus forcing the
obstruction out of the crusher, after which it can be removed
through the clean—out doors located on the sides of the trough,
just behind the crusher, (See 1255, Figure 1-7-2). Or, if the
coal is back far enough in the bunker, removal can be effected
by withdrawing it through the coal space. Should the
obstruction become lodged in the intermediate conduit, or
elevator pipe, there are two covers on the rear bowl (See 1056,
Figure 1-7-1) and one (See 28086, Figure 1-7-1) on the elevator
pipe through which access may be gained to the conveyor screw
for dealing with the trouble.
IMPORTANT; When removing an obstruction from the conveying
system be certain that the main steam valve and the
stoker steam valve are both shut tight, and that the
operating lever of the reversing valve is in the neutral
(central) position, and the conveyor screw is
stationary. Steps should also be taken to ensure that
no one opens (or alters) the valves concerned until the
work has been completed.
9 Stoker Failure.
T=7
Should the stoker fail on a journey, due to an obstruct-
ion, or a failure of the stoker engine, or screw conveyor,


T=7
sufficient steam may be maintained to work the train to the
nearest siding by hand firing.
When hand firing a stoker equipped locomotive the jets
should be kept working, and the coal placed (with the shovel)
on the distributing table, and the force of the jets allowed to
distribute it over the firegrate.
Taking Coal.
Before taking coal on a stoker fired locomotive all the
tender trough slides must be closed. The requirement of any
coal supply if needed for the fire between the coaling and
stabling points should be met by using the amount remaining in
the trough, supplemented by hand firing.
Any neglect to set the slides correctly in the closed
position before coaling will allow the coal to gain access to
the rear of the screw conveyor, resulting in difficulty being
experienced by the shed staff in making a proper inspection, and
carrying out any repairs required. Also, the outgoing Fireman
will not be able to test the stoker equipment without having
to deliver coal to the firebox, which he may not desire to do,
■j —yj Stabling.
When stabling a stoker fired locomotive the following
duties must be carried out, in addition to the normal locomotive
stabling duties for the Fireman as outlined in Section 5,
preceding herein.
1. Reverse the stoker engine for a few revolutions, to ensure
that any coal remaining in the elevator pipe is withdrawn.
This should be done so as to prevent any possibility of the
coal burning back inside the elevator pipe while the engine
is stabled.
2. Close the main steam valve to the stoker equipment, the
main jet valve, the stoker steam valve, and the steam valves
to the various distributing Jets, and put the control lever
of the reversing valve in the neutral position,
3. Report to the Driver any defects which may have developed
in the stoker equipment during the journey, so that he may
book them for attention by the Mechanical Staff.
Any other difficulty that seriously affected the proper
distribution of the coal, or produced unsatisfactory firing
conditions, and with which the Fireman had to contend in
firing the locomotive on the Journey, should likewise be
reported.
