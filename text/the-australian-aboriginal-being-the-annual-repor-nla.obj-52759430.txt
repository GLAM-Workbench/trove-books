EEPOET
OF THE
N.S.W, Aborigines Protection Association.
is the duty of your Council to present to you some record
of the work accomplished during another year, as well as
a review of important events which have transpired in
connection with the operations of the Association. In so doing
your Council desire as heretofore to place on record their gratitude
to the Giver of every good and perfect gift for the many mercies
vouchsafed and blessings given in the conduct of the work.
It is almost unnecessary to reiterate that the work of the
evangelisation of the remnant of this once numerous people—of
whom only about 7,000 remain—is very difficult, and the difficulty
is greatly increased by their nomadic habits, and the lack of
legislation to provide, in the interests of the people themselves,
restrictions which would attach them to certain large reserves to
be formed in various centres where large numbers are to be found.
The main work of the Association has been devoted to the
benefit of the aborigines located on the three mission stations—
Cumeroogunga, Warangesda, and Brewarrina and the mission
camp at La Perouse, near Botany. As a report from each of the
managers, who is also the missionary in charge of his respective
mission, appears on another page, we will here but briefly sum up
the progress made, and then refer to the general features of the
work, and set forth the suggestions of your Council as to the
necessity of extended effort to reach with the message of salva-
tion the many thousands who are still outside of all Christian
effort.
CUMEROOGUNGA.
No change has been made during the year in the officers
resident on the Station, and the Manager (Mr. Bruce Ferguson)
and the Overseer and Storekeeper (Mr. E. W. Pridham) and
Dormitory Matron (Mrs. B. W. Pridham) have given the utmost
satisfaction to your Council in the performance of their respective
duties. Dr. T. Orde Smith, the medical missionary, has devoted


mmselt to the work in no mere perfunctory spirit, and has had
the satisfaction of reporting regularly that no epidemic disease
had broken out on the station. Strict attention has been given
to the sanitation of the station.
During the year several of the aborigines have been granted
twenty acre blocks of land to cultivate for their own profit, with
a view to provide for the support of their own families. The
proposals and arrangements connected with this scheme were
published in detail in the last annual report. It is as yet too
soon to speak with certainty as to the success of the scheme, but
your Council is hopeful that many of those who have had some
years of training on the stations will be able to do much in the
direction indicated. One of the men has been granted a site for
a market garden, and has so far succeeded in securing a fair
return for his labour.
The total population on 31st December last was as follows :
Full-blood: Men, 11; women, 9; boys, 10; girls, 14. Half-
castes : Men, 31 ; women, 24 ; boys, 40 ; girls, 37.
Visits of inspection were made during the year by
Messrs. E. Fosbery and W. H. Suttor, M.L.C., representing
fche A. P. Board, also visited the station in June last.
The Public School, under the control of Mr. T. S. James,
continues to prove a successful adjunct to the work of the station.
The religious services have been conducted regularly
throughout the year, and though at times the attendances have
not been satisfactory, yet the evident blessing of the Lord has
accompanied the word spoken. The bright cheery testimony of
some of the residents gives cause for much encouragement. Even
in die hour of death the beautiful effects of the changing and
sustaining grace of God have been seen.
WARANGESDA.
The services of Mr. and Mrs. G. H. Harris, as Manager and
Matron, have been retained throughout the year, and in the
discharge of their duties they have merited the confidence of your
Council. Paddy Swift has been continued as Overseer, and
according to his ability has rendered assistance to the Manager.
Jennie Swift, who had for some time acted as Dormitory Matron,
died in October last, after a brief illness. Her closing words
were an admonition to faithfulness in the Master’s service, and
an expression of assured hope of salvation by faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ. She, with her husband, had been very useful since
her conversion in the public advocacy, both in England and
Australia, of the cause of her fellow aborigines.
The religious services have been held with regularity, and a
good average attendance secured throughout the year,


A visit of inspection was made by Mr. W. Lawso't
Dash, who accompanied Mr. E. Posbery and the Hon. W. H.
Suttor, M.L.C., during their visit. Miss Jeanie Watson, the
Missionary at La Perouse, also visited the station and held
special services.
The total number of residents on the station on the 31st
December last was 130, being composed as follows : —Pull-blood :
Men, 27 ; women, 13 ; boys, 2 ; girls, 3. Half-castes : Men, 24;
women, 19 ; boys, 20; girls, 22.
The children in attendance at the public school under the
management of Mr. (4. 0. Nash continue to make good progress
in their education.
BREWARRINA.
Mr. and Mrs. W. Hopkins have during the year continued
to occupy the positions of Manager and Matron respectively, as
well as to perform the duties of school teachers. The arrange-
ment has still proved satisfactory to the Council, and the reports
of the school inspector are also gratifying.
During the year several more of the elder lads and girls
have been apprenticed to surrounding selectors. Most of those
thus placed out have given entire satisfaction to their employers.
The terms for the first year are as follows : To be provided with
board and lodging and suitable clothing, and paid to the Manager
for the benefit of the apprentice a sum of two shillings and six-
pence per week.
The average attendance of the people at the religious services
has been highly gratifying, and the evident interest in the Gospel
message has clearly shown that it is still “ The power of God
unto salvation to every one that belie veth.”
Additions to the buildings have been made, provision being
secured for housing the single men. Further improvements have
been sanctioned, and will be proceeded with immediately. About
two miles of fencing have been re-erected, the posts being
replaced with new ones.
The cultivation of several acres of land has yielded ten tons of
hay, thus showing what could be done with irrigation. A large
area could be cultivated if a water-lift was erected at a cost of
about £3O.
On 31st December last there were on the station 69 persons,
as follows ;—Pull-bloods ; Men, 17 ; women, 20 ; boys, 6 ; girls,
4, Half-castes : Men, 2 ; women, 8 ; boys, 9 ; girls, 8.
During the year, Mr. J. Kidd, M.L.A., then Post Master
General, visited the station, and expressed himself as highly
pleased with the good order and management evidenced.


LA PEROUSE.
' As will be seen by the report on another page, Miss Jeanie
Watson has been appointed as the missionary in charge of the
work at La Perouse. This entails an additional expense of
£6O per year for salary and travelling expenses, and your Council
therefore appeal for special additional subscriptions towards this
work.
On 17th November last the Mission House, which was
erected at a cost of £3l 10s., was opened by the Rev. W. J. L.
Gloss, President of the Christian Endeavour Union. The amount
was subscribed by the various Societies connected with the 0. of
E. Union.
The influence of the workers has been felt in the suppression
of open gambling and drinking, though of course these have not
been entirely eradicated, owing to the frequency of the visits to
the camp of vicious white people, whose influence is very harmful
to the aborigines.
The interest of several individual Christian workers, as well
as of some of the Christian Endeavour Societies, has been aroused,
with the result that occasional visits have been made and help
rendered to the missionary. Considering the easy access to the
camp from Botany or Waverley, we would be glad if some of the
clergymen will arrange for an occasional visit and service.
Mr. Kendall and Miss McGill deserve special mention for the
great service rendered by them in the conduct of the mission.
They have frequently visited the mission and assisted in the
various meetings.
GENERAL.
The past twelve months have been peculiarly trying in the
matter of securing a sufficiency of income to meet all the demands
even of the limited work being done by the Council, and the
difficulty has made it practically impossible to render any aid to
the large number of aborigines still outside all Christian effort.
Surely it should only be necessary that the bare fact of the
needs of the “ heathen at our doors ” be presented to the Christian
conscience to enlist the necessary sympathy to secure an adequate
income not only to keep in operation the present limited
endeavour, but also to enable the Council to undertake work in
behalf of those scattered in the various parts of the colony.
Your Council is more than ever convinced that the clear
Christian duty of the churches is to seek to support your
Association, by all means in their power, to send the Gospel to
this too long neglected people. It is sad to reflect that in very
few instances do any of the churches attempt to reach such of
the aborigines as are in their immediate neighbourhood. These


people seem indeed to be considered by many Christian ministers
and church members as incapable of receiving the testimony of God’s
grace, yet there is abundant evidence in the altered lives of
numbers of the people to the efficacy of the Gospel of God.
While the enthusiasm of multitudes of Christians has been
aroused, even to the point of self-sacrifice in behalf of the heathen
abroad, and several noble young men and women have gone out
with their lives in their hands to China, India, and the islands
of the sea, it is certainly surprising that a paltry sum of £143 is
the total contribution of the combined churches to the evangelisa-
tion of the aborigines of New South Wales, and that only one
missionary has offered herself for the work amongst the
aborigines.
In consequence of the visit of Mr. E. Fosbery, J.P., (the Chair-
man), and the Hon. W. H. Suttor, M.L.0., a member of the Govern-
ment Board, to the mission stations at Warangesda and Cumeroo-
gunga, certain suggestions were made which have resulted in the
adoption of rules and regulations for the management of the mission
stations. These regulations provide that the Board meet all expen-
diture for the maintenance of the stations, but are not in any way
responsible for the religious work of the missions, the whole
responsibility for the work connected therewith devolving upon
your Association. It is' therefore of urgent necessity that
subscribers shall not in any measure lessen their gifts, but rather
increase their liberality.
Once more the necessity for the appointment of a travelling
missionary is urged. Until the adoption of some comprehensive
scheme for the settlement on large reserves in various centres of the
now fast diminishing race, little other can be done than to send out
travelling missionaries who will spend an occasional week or more
according to the need of the tribe at each camp, and tell them of
the Saviour’s redeeming love. Will not some of those who have
secured a large interest in the land off which so many of the race
have been driven, and who have by their utilisation i n many instances
of the labour of this people accumulated wealth, help us to send
out the first travelling missionary ? To defray the cost for the
first year, a sum of about <£2so would be needed in addition to
such subscriptions as could be secured at meetings held by the
missionary in the various townships he visited.
The Council have several times considered the possibility of
providing some means for reaching the scattered tribes throughout
the colony, and are earnestly desirous of being enabled to carry
the glad tidings of salvation to them. At present the way is
not open, for while a suitable man is willing to undertake, at any
rate, a portion of this work, funds are not forthcoming for this
so desirable effort. While we are waiting hundreds are dying
yearly, and unfortunately not in their primitive ignorance, but


corrupted by the vices incident to contact with our so-called
civilisation, and in partial knowledge of the blessings of
Christianity. The twin evils—intemperance and sexual
immorality—are carrying off large numbers year by year.
The desirableness of legislation enacting the improvements
as suggested in last year’s annual report is still urged, and your
Council express the earnest hope that the Government will as
speedily as possible introduce the necessary measure. Such
legislation should provide for the appointment of a Director of
Aboriginal affairs, whose duties should be somewhat analagous
to those of the Director of Charitable Institutions, and also that he
should personally visit the reserves, camps, etc., at frequent
ntervals.
Your Council insist on the fact that in most cases, indeed
nearly all, it will ever be important to keep absolute control of
and supervision over the blocks of land granted to individual
families for cultivation for their own profit. Any attempt to
separate from proper control by the Manager, as provided by the
regulations printed with last year’s report, would prove injurious
to the people themselves, and render abortive the scheme for mak-
ing them in some measure independent of Government support.
In view of proposed land legislation, alienating reserves and
throwing open for selection, portion of runs, it is desirable that
further large areas of land be set apart for use of aborigines.
Since the foregoing report was prepared, Mr. Bruce Ferguson
resigned his position, and Mr. E. W. Pridham was appointed in
his stead as Manager of Cumeroogunga Mission Station.


Managers’ "Reports
BREWARRINA MISSION STATION
Report for 1894.
Although the season is now continuing dry, we had a
favourable time in the early part of the year. So much so that
we have secured a fair crop of wheat for hay, having sold 1 ton
for £4, and will have about 7 tons more to part with. We have
abundance of grass in the bends and flats where the flood waters
went over last year, so we are not suffering in any way for the
want of grass, for which we should be thankful to the Giver of
every good and perfect gift. Our wool clip for the year has been
remarkably good, yielding over 2 tons from 666 sheep shorn, for
which the market value has ruled low. Having also sold 174
skins at Is. 6d. each, and have had two lambings during the
year, in all 288 lambs. I am thankful to say that the secular
work of the mission is still progressing, having ringbarked about
500 acres, stumped 20 acres, and securely stubbed our sheep and
cattle yards so that we can now work them in comfort. We have
also removed a line of fence about miles into a position more
suitable for the benefit of the station, so that we have now 6
large paddocks well secured, also a moderate sized paddock for
horses, and a small one for our rams. We have erected a house
for single men fitted up with ten bunks, and the old store com-
pletely repaired, the old mud walls taken down and substituted
with weather boards and fitted up with benches, etc., to store
our goods upon. The children in our school have made good
progress during the year, the Inspector reporting favourably.
There have been 174 services held during the year, well attended,
and marked attention paid to the good tidings of God’s gift,
which brought peace and good will towards men. And although
we may see but little fruit for our labour of love for the Master,
here we are told that we shall reap if we faint not. The children
still take an interest in the Sunday school, several of them can
repeat by heart the 10th and 14th chapter of the gospel by John,
so that Mrs. Hopkins and myself fed and trust that our labour
of love in the Lord will not be in vain. We have 102 names on
the roll, of whom 69 were here on the 31st, and 54 attended ser-
vice in the morning. Births, 2; deaths, 2, an old man and
woman ; marriage, 1.
In closing this report at the end of this another year’s ser-
vice for my Lord, whose mercy endureth for ever, we still feel
thankful to our Father God for the health and strength bestowed


upon us and those with whom we dwell in the midst. And that
we can still trust in His word that He will never leave or forsake,
and that by His blessing and comfort we may feel more confident
and happy in our work here for His Name’s Sake.
WILLIAM HOPKINS, Manager.
Mr. G. E. A.rdill, Gen. Secretary,
Aborigines’ Protection Association.
CUMEROOGUNGA MISSION STATION.
Report for 1894.
Allow me first to express the great pleasure I feel at the
ever-deepening and widening interest which is being awakened on
behalf of the Aborigines of Australia, and my still greater anxiety
that the sympathetic waves may be so guided as to advance the
highest interests of our colored brethren.
If asked what would most benefit the aborignes of this
colony, and pave the way for still more effective evangelistic
work, and training in habits of industry and thrift, I would reply,,
“ Legislation—on the lines of the Victorian and Canadian Acts,
as suggested by the Council in their Report for 1892.”
To those who forget what the Station and its residents were
a few years ago, the work may appear discouraging, whilst to
those who best understand the great and peculiar difficulties of
mission work among the aborigines, and the contrast between
what this station and its occupants were and what they are, the
results are most encouraging.
The great majority of the men are able-bodied, fairly-
educated and well-trained half-castes, who are now quite
competent to earn their own living, so long as we can provide
work for them for a month or two in winter, and educate their
children. My efforts to get rid of the growing tendency among
able-bodied half-castes and quadroons to look to the Government,
instead of their own strong arms, for support, have not been
altogether crowned with success. Such efforts, however gently
and kindly made, naturally lead to a certain amount of temporary
dissatisfaction.
The quality of free goods issued has, in all cases, been equal
to, and, in many instances, superior to, those formerly supplied,
and the aid given to aged aborigines, and to those in actual need,
more effective. All children are supplied with free rations, which
includes flour, hops, tea, sugar, mutton or beef, rice, oatmeal,
kerosene or candles, salt, pepper, soap, and Christmas goods ; also
milk, each family, as far as possible, being allowed one cow’s


milk. Able-bodied men are required to work for the support of
themselves and their wives. As we live some miles from the
nearest town, the selling store has been a great boon to many,
who would otherwise be compelled to travel far for necessaries.
The health of the people has been good, as evidenced by the
low death rate among the residents, and of those who passed
away during the year, it may be truly said that they fell asleep
in Jesus. The sanitary arrangements are good, and the cleanli-
ness—for an aboriginal settlement—beyond question. The high
floods, which surrounded the village, and covered two-thirds of
the reserve for several months, were not conducive to the health
of the children, many of whom suffered from bronchitis, &c. It
is very difficult to keep aboriginal children out of the water.
They get into bark canoes, and splash about until their clothes
are wet, and, as some mothers are by no means careful or
judicious, the sick list is greatly augmented. Dr. Smith has, as
usual, visited the station officially each month, or oftener in
urgent cases, and, I may add, at all hours. He has been most
painstaking and enthusiastic, and has rendered invaluable aid as
medical officer and earnest Christian co-worker. We are also
indebted to the Echuca Hospital, and especially to the matron
(Mrs. Murdoch) for her great kindness to Old Maggie, an aged
aboriginal who was for some time an inmate of the hospital, and
who, after undergoing a critical operation, has been completely
restored to health and strength. Many of our aborigines have
reason to gratefully remember the Echuca Hospital. Our
Dispensary has been efficiently attended to by Mr. Pridham. All
medicines or surgical dressings prescribed by the medical officer
have been supplied to aborigines free, and delicacies cooked by
the matrons and supplied to invalids until they were sufficiently
convalescent to enjoy the ordinary fare, the visitation of the
the sick and cottage meetings being important items on their pro-
gramme. Cases of serious illness have been skillfully and system-
atically nursed by the matrons, with good results.
The children in school continue to make good progress under
the tuition of their kind and painstaking teacher, the average
attendance for the year being 52-2.
The daily average of residents for the year has been about
130, and the greatest number of aborigines located here during
the holidays 190. On our roll the people are classified as
follows :
Blacks. Half-Castes. Quadroons, Etc.
Men ..12 I Women.. 10 1 Men ..43 I Women.. 22 I Men ..7 I Women., lo
Boys .. 11 I Girls .. 15 | Boys .. 31 | Girls .. 26 ) Boys.. 3 | Girls
Total: 196.
There have been 7 births during the year, and, including
strangers who came, or, were brought here dangerously ill, 6 deaths
—3 adults, and 3 children.


Daring the year 341 services have been held in the Mission
Church, with an average attendance of 30 per cent, of the popu-
lation. They are very fond of music and pictures, a sacred
concert or lantern entertainment never failing to draw a crowded
house. The attendance and attention in Sunday School is good,
and the children have for this year a fair knowledge of sacred
history ; the adults also have a fair grasp of biblical truth, but
it is only at rare intervals that we meet with cases which so
beautifully illustrate the glorious truth that “ the gospel is the
power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth” as that
of the late Charles Edwards, a young aboriginal from La
Perouse. Those who witnessed his last months must involuntarily
have exclaimed : “ Let me die the death of the righteous ; and let
my end be like his.”
The cottages are all in fair condition. Some improvements
have been made, and some deterioration taken place. Four new
w.b. cottages have been erected. The store is much improved.
Some improvements have also been made in the Church—an old
and unsightly building—which was not originally built for a
church ; the interior has been made more comfortable. Some
improvements have been made in the streets and cottage gardens,
including culverts across the surface drains, and a good deal of
picket fencing. A supply of water for domestic purposes is now
available from the street taps, the water being raised by horse
power from the Murray, and conveyed in underground pipes from
end to end of the village.
The basket willows and fruit trees are growing luxuriantly,
and all who have cultivated their gardens have been rewarded in
proportion to their skill and industry with fruits and vegetables, the
village being situated on the most fertile portion of a reserve,
consisting principally of barren sand hills and red gum, swamps,
with a few scattered patches and narrow ridges of really good
land. The reserve is unsuited for agricultural operations on a
large scale, and it is so liable to floods as to be unsuited for
pastoral purposes xmless an additional area is granted as a flood
refuge. Excellent fruit might be grown in some places, but the
spots suitable for orchards are small and scattered, and better
suited for aborigines’ garden sites, or small farm blocks, than
for station cultivation.
Seven half-castes and one aboriginal have been granted farm
blocks in accordance with the Farm Block Scheme published with
last year’s report. They have made some progress in grubbing,
clearing and fencing. I beg to suggest that in view of the low
price now offered for wheat, etc., that they be encouraged to plant
as an experiment on each block a quarter of an acre of olives, and
that those who have moist, sandy soil be encouraged to plant
basket willow cuttings, which would by-and-by provide them


with employment congenial to them. A plantation of olives
might with advantage be made by the manager as a model. One
aboriginal has been granted a garden site of two acres ; and I beg
to suggest that he be assisted to purchase a pump and pipes, suit-
able for lifting and conveying water from the swamp adjoining
his block to the highest portion of his garden—where it could
pass through a manure tank—and then be conducted in channels
in all directions.
The station paddocks, gates, fences, implement sheds,
stables, hay sheds, etc., are all in good order. In addition to the
usual routine of mission work, the suckers all over the station
were cut down, and a good deal of grubbing, fencing, shed
building, etc., etc., completed. 100 acres were cropped with
wheat, about 40 acres were cut for hay—which we were fortunate
enough to secure before the heavy rains set in—the remainder, a
beautiful crop, was unfortunately left for wheat and about 30
acres in one paddock destroyed by heavy summer rains and rust—
we stripped the whole lot but the return a/'as very poor. One of
the aboriginals put in over twenty acres of wheat, nearly all of
which he cut for hay, but failed to secure it before the heavy
rains set in, his returns are about nil.
All horses, sheep and cattle on the station are in good con-
dition, much better than they usually are at this season, and
though we have no grass to waste we have a sufficiency for the
stock in hand, which includes in addition to the stock in my valu-
ation of property, a large number of horses, a few sheep and some
cattle, the private property of the aborigines.
In conclusion, the mission and reserve have steadily in-
creased in efficiency and value, and the whole establishment's
now in satisfactory working order.
BRUCE FERGUSON, Manager.
Mr. G. E. Ardill, Gen. Secretary,
Aborigines’ Protection Association.
Medical Missionary’s Report for 1894.
During the past year the public health of Cumeroogunga
has been, on the whole, exceptionally good ; no epidemic appeared,
except influenza of a mild type.
The steady cultivation amongst tne natives of habits of
cleanliness, the wholesome food, the greater abundance of milk,
vegetables, and fruit, and the successful laying-on of water by Mr.
Ferguson has undoubtedly conduced to the improved health of
the Station.
I find that the people are being educated practically in
habits of thrift and self-dependence, and the place is being con-
ducted more on business lines than ever.


The system has been pursued of elevating, not pauperising.
Every effort has been made to keep the recreations at home,
and not to send our young people travelling about to amuse the
white population, the effect of which is obviously degrading in
its tendency, leading them into bad company, drink, and vicious
habits of all sorts.
Anyone that visits the station now, after being away some
time, will be struck by the vast improvement in the outward
appearance of the settlement, with its pretty white cottages and
neat little gardens, with their fruit trees and flowers, and the
general look of comfort and cleanliness which characterises this
little spot on the Murray.
Last, but not least, I am happy to say, the people are being
instructed both by precept and example in the ways of God, and
I am persuaded that a work has been done in the hearts of
many, that will more than all else affect Cumeroogunga for good,
and tend to fulfil that crowning object of your association —lead-
ing the people to Christ.

WARANGESDA MISSION STATION.
Report for 1894.
When considering the difficulties that have been experienced
in regard to the spiritual work of the mission, we certainly have
great reason to be filled with gratitude for the way we have been
sustained and helped.
Morally the people are steadily improving and there is a
deeper feeling of unity and goodwill amongst them. The
residents who make the station a permanent home show a marked
improvement and manifest a general interest for the moral and
social welfare of the people. But a number of the people are
ever coming and going so that the good they receive is overcome.
This is noticeable in young men who have shown a deep interest
in spiritual truths, after they leave the station fall back into evil
habits again. It is hard for them to give up the habits that have
grown with them almost from their infancy. We see many of
them striving to do so, but they have such a hold upon them
that they need every encouragement and require very patient
treatment.
The Rev. G. R. F. Nobbs has continued his ministration
throughout the year, taking services and visiting the people in
their cottages, and giving religious instruction in the day school.


As regards the general health of the people there has been
a great deal of sickness for about nine months of the year. The
measles went right through the station, very few escaping,
between twenty and thirty being down at a time. Several cases
of typhoid and consumption also occurred.
One of our great difficulties is that we have no medical
officer attending the station, so that in severe cases of sick-
ness the patients have to travel 40 miles to see the doctor, and
often the journey is injurious to them. They have a great
antipathy to the hospital, often preferring to camp outside than to
go in.
A fair amount of work has been done, 65 acres were ploughed
and 60 acres sown with wheat, 330 acres ringbarked; about 100
acres suckered ; 25 acres grubbed.
The school children are still under the instruction of Mr. G.
C. Nash and are making good progress, the report of the
inspector being very good.
We have received several gifts of clothing from the Bowral
Branch of the Y.M.C.A., Mrs. Debenham, of the Grammar School,
Young; Mrs. Y. Dowling, of Lue, Mudgee line, and one from a
lady near Quirindi. The presents sent by the Council were given
out on New Year’s eve, every child on the station getting either
a dress or a suit of clothes.
The number of aborigines on the station at the close of the
of the year being ;
Blacks. Half Castes.

LA PEROUSE MISSION.
Report for 1894.
Another year of service with the Master has ended. It has
been one of varied experience, but whether on the hill-top or in
the valley, our Lord has been with us.
The spiritual life of the people has grown.
A Christian Endeavour Society has been formed with a
membership of twelve, viz. : Active, 6 (including Mr. Kendall
and myself) ; Associate, 6. Much earnestness is manifest at the
meetings of this Society. The hymns and scripture verses read


by the members are always very appropriate, but the most
touching part is the chain prayer ; there are sometimes only two
or three links to the chain, but they are such simple and earnest
outpourings from their hearts, that we feel ourselves brought
right before God’s throne by them.
Their Christianity does not end here. A change is manifest
in their everyday life. The little leaven is working, and will, we
trust, leaven the whole lump before long.
It is only on very rare occasions that there is any disturb-
ance caused by them coming home under the influence of drink,
while at one time, on Saturdays especially, it was a regular
occurrence ;it is also seldom given to them at the camp. Gambl-
ing is not so prevalent as it was, the white people never trouble
us in that direction now.
Services have been held regularly as follows : Sunday, 11 a.m.,
Evangelistic Bible Class, 3 p.m. The evening is generally spent
in singing. Wednesday night, Christian Endeavour. Saturday
night, singing or entertainments, the latter not so frequent of
late as we would like, our resources having run out. Frequently
requests have been made that a service should be held on one of
the intervening evenings, and especially that the word should be
explained.
Two tea meetings have been given, one at Botany and one
at La Perouse.
On Eight Hour Day sports were held, boomerang throwing,
running, etc. Owing to the kindness of friends, a good supply of
fruit and lollies were distributed.
17th November is a day never to be forgotten by our people,
as on that day the Mission House, built by the New South
Wales Endeavourers, was opened. Hitherto services had been
held in the open air, in a small room in one of the cottages, or
latterly in a large tent covered with sacks, given to us by one of
the men who w’as leaving la Perouse, and very happy times we
had there. At last our Mis lon House was built and ready for
use. It is only a plain room, but a great improvement on the
tent. Our people made it look very attractive with flowers
and evergreens. About three o’clock a bus arrived, con-
veying friends from Sydney to witness the opening ceremony.
Mr. U. W. Carpenter, Chairman A. P. A., occupied the chair,
and after a few suitable remarks, called upon the Rev. W. J. L.
Gloss, Pres. N.S.W. C.E. Union, to give the opening address. A
collection was taken up, which enabled the Chairman to declare
the building open free of debt, the entire cost being £3l 10s.
The only furniture it contained being a few planks and boxes for
seats, and a harmonium. A refreshment stall was provided by
friends, and owing to their generosity, after our visitors left, our
people partook of a picnic tea. After tea we adjourned to the


Mission room for our usual Saturday night gathering. Thus
ended a very happy day.
Three Christian Endeavour Societies have visited us during
the year—William-street Wesleyan, Petersham Congregational,
and Mill Hill Presbyterian, the latter having rendered valuable
assistance from time to time, Miss McGill, one of their members,
has taken entire charge of the work on two occasions. Our
Christian Endeavour members have also received several invita-
tions to attend Endeavour socials and special meetings. They
have always met with a warm welcome.
Arrangements have been made to visit the Aboriginal
prisoners in gaol, fortnightly, and hold services with them. These
visits, according to the reports of officers, are always looked
forward to, especially by the sick. One object in visiting is to try
and influence the prisoners to go to one of the missions on being
released. Great attention and kindness have been shown by the
officers to the visitor.
Two visits have been paid to the South Coast, one to
Coolangatta, the other to Illawarra Lake. Services were held in
both places among the aborigines, also public services. A wish
was expressed that the visits would soon be repeated.
The Hospitals have also been visited, and those sick comforted.
A library has been formed. We are indebted to Miss
Liggins’s College for girls for the two dozen volumes it contains.
Gifts of clothing have been received from time to time,
which are always acceptable.
We are thankful to Almighty God for guidance given, for
again we have proved that “He is faithful that promised.”
Trusting Him for strength, we press on.

Gentlemen Smokers desiring mild Tobacco naturally choose
the Bright Gold Leaf kinds, submitting to the burning of the tongue
which these tobaccos invariably create.
Champion Blended Stock (i-lb., J-lb., l-lb. tins) is a combination
of mildness and richness, without burning the tongue, and is specially
adapted to the Gentlemen smokers of Australia. The price is
moderate, and the Manufacturers merely ask the public to make the
trial.
