A Programme of Events
recalling sad and memories conspicious in the
life of the Jubilarian.
He entered St. Eunan’s Seminary, Letterkenny, Donegal, Ire-
land, for his prepartory studies —mainly latin and greek —in 1897.
He left Ireland and arrived at the Irish College, Salamanca, |j
Spain, in 1901 for his philosophical and theological career which |
was brilliant. On the 24th May, 1907 —the feast of Our Lady S
7 Help of Christians —he was ordained a priest of God and left
= Salamanca for Australia on the 30th June, 1907. |
• ■ n
Australia welcomed a new Soggarth Aroon on the 31st October,
and his first Mass on Southern Cross soil was celebrated on the
feast of All Saints on that hallowed spot —St. Patrick’s, Church
Hill, Sydney.
On the 3rd November, 1907, he for the first time, saw Goul-
= burn, but immediately moved on to. his first appointment —Boorowa. =
r* 7 r«
In March, 1908, he was recalled to Goulburn, where, as he =
§ says himself, the happiest two years of his life were spent with g
s his old friend and counsellor Father Reidy, Adm.
The year 1910 finds him at Temora —1912 at Wagga Wagga—
and in 1915 he received his first appointment as Pastor to Ardle-
than, where he built a beautiful presbytery.
In 1920 we find him at Moruya where he was unfortunate
5 enough to contract an illness that kept him in hospital for close
H on eighteen months.
Completely recovered, thanks be to God, he was appointed E
to Young in 1922 —Goolagong in 1923, as locum tenens, and then =
5 his first appointment under Bishop Barry came in August 1923 5
to Bungendoro, where he still happily reigns as pastor.
= Here ho has done wonders in renovating the Church and Pros-
bytery. He built a new school and furnished it magnificently, ||
= and just lately, a remodelled convent, costing between £3OOO and =
= £4OOO, and ideally furnished, was opened. At present, only the =
furnishing debt remains unliquidated—a truly marvellous perfor- s
= mance! Last, but not least, he has erected a spiritual edifice in =
= the hearts of his people, second to none in any parish in the dio- =
cose, and its solidity is unquestioned, because it has for a founda- 1
= tion his own personal holiness and practical work for God.

Priests’ Address
Reverend and Dear Father,
We, your friends and fellow priests of the Diocese of Goulburn, a
= join with your faithful people in congratulating you on the occasion j|
= of your Sacerdotal Silver Jubilee. We admire your many priestly 1
= qualities; your zeal for souls and your exemplary life. Many of
us have known and loved you during a number of years, and have =
benefited by your sound advice, have been the recipients of your a
kindness of heart and your generosity. You have spoken many ||
a word of encouragement to us, and so we have come, some of us =
from a distance, to show by our presence how deeply we hold you =|
in our remembrance.
It is a cause for pride and rejoicing, dear and Reverend Father,
to realise that we have priests like you in our Diocese, and we
pray to God on this Day of Days for you, that Ho will fill your
soul with His choicest gifts and blessings. May He brighten the
g future for you as He has brightened the past. May He help you
1 to bear whatever burdens He wills you arc to carry; give you
length of years and strength to work for Him; and, at the last,
E welcome you Home when the day is done and the work is over.
Your devoted friends and confreres—the Priests of the Goul- a
burn Diocese. =
Signed on behalf of the Priests

Citizens' Address
Reverend and Dear Father,
We, the Parishioners of Bungendore, have come together with E
full hearts, to rejoice with you, and to congratulate you on having §
attained your twenty-five years in the Sacred Priesthood, to which |
your life has been given. E
It is well that occasions like the present give us an opportunity =
of voicing our appreciation of our devoted Pastors. Their noble =
lives are usually taken as a matter of course. We know so well =
that our Priest is ever ready, day or night, early or late, in Winter i
snow or Summer heat, in sickness or health, in good fortune or |
bad, in life, but above all at the hour of death, to risk his own |
life for the eternal Salvation of one soul —yea, even the least in =
his parish if needs be. And to this, dear Father, you have been
trained. To this were devoted the fresh, full, beautiful years of 1
your student life; and when at the end of seven or eight years S
you had proved yourself in your ardent preparation, for this =
noblest calling of all, then came the crowning blessing—your solemn E
Ordination which gave you to God’s special work forever. =
l-j
Indeed, in your case, there was a double sacrifice, for even i
your preparatory student years were spent in a foreign land— |
that Spain which you would scarcely recognise to-day as a Catholic 5
country, to which you sorrowfully bade adieu a quarter of a 1
century ago. Then came the greatest sacrifice of all— the severing 1
of the ties that bound you to your native land, and to the home □
of your childhood and your beloved parents and friends. And i
all this for us—to labour for souls beneath the “Southern Cross.” |
However, we arc glad to know that you did not find us too bad g
in Australia, for you have never left its sunny shores for a return 1
visit, as many of your friends have been able to do.
Let us hope you have made it the land of your adoption, and =
we trust, if it is God’s Holy Will, that you will finish in our midst |
what you have so well begun; the white gleaming spotless road of |
your Holy Priestly life lies behind you. May it continue until it
leads you to Heaven’s Portal, where you will find the reward of |
all your sacrifices—your exile, your ill health patiently borne, and, £
above all, of a life whose chief object was the salvation of souls. 7
Onr small Jubilee Gift is scarcely commensurate to the occasion,
but we know you will readily understand the reason, so with
deepest gratitude for all you have done and are doing for us,
We beg to remain dear Reverend Father, o
On behalf of your Appreciative Parishioners

joyous occasion.
May you be spared to celebrate your Golden Jubilee, and may
we all be amongst the number, who will, please God, be here to
9 greet you on that happy day.

Jubilee Ode
Long years have circled since that blessed morn,
When to thy waiting heart the words were borne
That made thee Priest of God! Another Christ
To do His work on earth, Who sacrificed
Himself that all His friends one day might be
With Him in joys above eternally.
Well hast thou kept those heavenly truths in view;
Well hast thou taught them to thy children who
With thee for guide advance in wisdom’s ways
And sing to-day their jubilee of praise,
That God has given thee our pastor true
To lead us heavenward with the chosen few.
Oh! may thy Silver Jubilee to-day
Be earnest of long years to come, we pray,
May Golden Jubilee still find thee here
And Diamond Jubilee thy heart still cheer
Amongst thy children. And at length for thee
May love Eternal be thy Jubilee.

Irish College, Salamanca
= Friends of the Rev. Father O’Sullivan in Australia will g
naturally be inclined to ask—seeing that there arc so many cmi- □
nent Ecclesiastical Colleges in Ireland, why did he migrate from g
Ireland to Spain to receive his education for the priesthood? =
The answer: The religious persecution commenced by
Henry VIII, and Cromwell, and, if anything, intensified under
Elizabeth and James I, led to the supression of the monastic schools
in Ireland in which the clergy, for the most part, received their
education. It became necessary, therefore, to seek education
abroad, and many colleges for the education of the secular clergy
were founded on the Continent, at Rome, in Spain and Portugal,
y in Belgium and in France.
The Spanish Kings provided five colleges and the estates to
H support them. The most famous of the Irish Colleges in Spain 5
was that of Salamanca, founded by a decree of Philip ITT, dated 1
1592, and opened in 1593. The Jesuits governed the College from g
1 inception till the Order was expelled from Spain in 1767. Since §
that date the rectors of the College have been selected from g
amongst the Irish secular clergy, presented by the Bishops of Ire- g
land and confirmed by the King of Spain. To-day only one of §
the five—Salamanca —remains in existence, and it has a world-wide g
reputation as well as the distinction of having produced the first
President of Ireland’s premier ecclesiastical seminary—Maynooth
College—in the person of Dr. Thomas Hussey.
Being, therefore, an Irish Ecclesiastical Seminary, founded for, |
| and controlled by, Irish Priests, the raw material must be supplied |
from Ireland, in the person of young students seeking entrance §
into the religious life. The Irish Bishops have bursaries estab- |
= lished there, and when a vacancy occurs, through the ordination g
g of one of their subjects, the place is immediately filled by another |
g candidate. Very often, too, health reasons play a major part in =
the selection, as was, in truth, the case with' the Rev. Father =
7 M. D. O’Sullivan. Thanks be to God he has weathered the storm =
successfully during his twenty-five years residence in Australia, 1
5 except for a period of serious illness between 1920 and 1922; and =
to-day, no doubt, he can thank a Merciful Providence, that directed g
him to sunny Australia and peaceful, restful Bungendore, that we |
5 ai ‘ (> gathered together to cheer and encourage him on towards I
g another goal rather than lament his departure and sing his requiem. i
