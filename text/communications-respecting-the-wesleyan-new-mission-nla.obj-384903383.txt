COMMUNICATIONS
RESPECTING THE
WESLEYAN NEW MISSION
NEW BRITAIN.
Since the July number of the Missionary Notices was issued from
the press, communications of very great interest have reached us
from L iji relating to our new mission enterprise. These we have
determined to publish and distribute without delay.
The letters and papers now made public will fully inform our
friends of the progress of the enterprise after the resolution adopted
by the Missionaries in Fiji and Mr. Brown (see July Notices ) to
carry out the original plan of the Committee.
The friends of Christian Missions will greatly rejoice in the
result of the extraordinary action taken by the Fiji Government in
regard to the nine teachers who were about to accompany Mr. Browm
to New Britain. While we certainly have no reason to complain of
the manner in which this enquiry issued, we do think we have cause
of complaint of the way in which it was begun and carried out. It
appears to us that a course might have been taken which, "while quite
as effectual in guarding the interests of the natives, might have
expressed a frank, generous, and not undeserved confidence in the
men who have contributed to make Fiji what it is to-day.
If defamers of Missions are really candid and superior to vulgar
prejudice, as they profess, the issue of that enquiry should convince
them that missionaries, as a class, arc not devoid of sincerity and
honesty.
Again we commend the Rev. George Brown, his brave and
devoted helpers, the mission vessel, and all on board, to the sympathy
and earnest prayers of all who love the Redeemer.
Sydney, July 20th, 1875.


(Letter from Rev. George Brown, dated Levuka, Fiji, Line 11, 1875.)
As we hope to leave Fiji very
soon, I prepare a few lines to
await the first opportunity. My
last was dated May 24th. On
that day we left Levuka in our
steam launch, the “ Henry Reed,”
intending to go direct to Bau,
but we lost the tide near Yiwa,
and so had to anchor and spend
the night with Mr. and Mrs.
Lindsay at the Mission House,
on that beautiful little island
which occupies such an important
position in the mission history of
Fiji.
On the 26th Brother Webb
and I started for Navuloa, as I
wished to arrange with Brother
Waterhouse about vhe teachers
for our voyage, and also to visit
Brother Webb’s circuit up the
Rewa River. We called at
Navuloa, but deferred onr meet-
ing with the teachers until our
return. We left Bau at 8 a.m.,
Navuloa at 10 a.m., Rewa at 3
p.m., Davuilevu (Mr. Baker’s old
station) at 4.20 p.m., and came
to anchor a little below Mr.
Storck’s plantation, at Viti, at 1
a.m.
Rewa is a fine river, and I
thoroughly enjoyed the trip,
though we heard sad tales of the
fearful ravages caused by the
measles as we passed village after
village on the banks of the river.
At one small village where we
landed we were told that more
than eighty of the inhabitants
had died. In many of the towns
one-half of the people are dead,
and in very few indeed does the
mortality fall below one-fourth
of the inhabitants. Whole
villages were struck down at
once, so that there was no one to
dig the graves or prepare the
food, and starvation helped the
disease in its deadly work. We
were told of some villages where
there was no one to take out the
dead for burial, so the sick and
the dying had to scratch holes in
the houses by the side of their
own beds in which to cover up
their dead. Other details were
absolutely sickening to hear, and
need not be repeated now. The
stench from the houses was in-
tolerable, and those who went
about from day to day among the
people on their errands of mercy
did their work amid circum-
stances which involved no incon-
siderable amount of suffering and
self-sacrifice on their part.
Our missionaries and teachers
have nobly done their work
during this fearful visitation.
Amongst the teachers there were
some who proved themselves to
be cowards by leaving the towns
in which they were stationed
when the disease attacked them,
and going away to their own
villages; but these are the ex-
ceptions, and when we consider
what an effect this epidemic has
had on the native mind, we can
only wonder that the number is
so few. There has, of course,
been an attack made upon
our missionaries during this
severe trial by one or two
of a certain class of whites
here. The missionaries them-
selves are not willing to answer
the charges, as they know well
that they are utterly false, and
are assured that no one in Fiji —
not even the writer himself—
believes them. I can only assure
you that, after hearing the inci-
dents which have been told me, I
feel proud of our missionaries and
2


their wives, and of our noble band
of teachers in Fiji. They have
done their work well, and will
assuredly have their reward.
With regard to the work done by
our teachers, I will give you the
testimony of a respectable planter
who had the best opportunity for
judging. When we were lying
at anchor in the Rewa waiting
for the tide a boat bumped
against us in the darkness, and
as soon as its occupants recovered
from their surprise we found that
it was that of a Rewa planter on
his way home. He came along-
side the launch, and stayed with
us some time, telling us of what
he had seen during the prevalence
of the epidemic. I need not re-
peat the sad tales he told us, but
will give you his testimony to the
faithful labours of one of our
teachers far away from the mis-
sionary under whose care he is
placed. He saw him from day
to day at his work, though far
from well himself, trying hard
to fight his way through the
difficulties —attending the sick,
burying the dead, and doing all
he could for the good of the
people under his care. The
gentleman who was telling us the
tale said—“ I saw him hard at
work every day. One day I
watched him as he buried six of
his people, and saw as he buried
the last one that he himself was
scarcely able to move about from
weakness and exhaustion, but he
kept manfully at his work.” The
kind heart of the planter was
touched with the sufferings and
manifest weakness of the poor
fellow, and he had a fowl killed
and sent it over to him to
strengthen him a little. And
liere 1 may say that this is not
given as a solitary instance of
that gentleman’s kindness to the
natives, or of the kindness shewn
by other planters to them. I
believe most of the planters and
merchants have done all they
could to help the natives. They
have made, perhaps, no very great
profession of affection for the
Fijians, but the true English
heart ever melts at the sight of
suffering, and is ever ready to
respond to an appeal for help, and
so it has been in Fiji.
Of the missionaries themselves
I care not to say much now.
They have all worked well, and
have suffered much. I can tell
of one who, with his own family
sick, with a large town stricken
down at once to attend to, had to
work day and night to minister
to their wants until his own stock
of stores was expended ; and but
for the kind help of one of the
Government officials, he and his
family would have suffered from
hunger. I can tell of another
missionary who, when there was
no one in the town able to dig
the yams, went into the bush
himself, dug the yams, brought
them home and cooked them for
his starving people. I can tell
of his having to watch them day
by day to keep them from
injuring themselves by their
own ignorance—one day having
to go and drag a poor half-
maddened Fijian woman from
a waterhole into which, in
her despair, she had rushed, in
the vain hope of cooling her
fevered body. I can tell of one
good lady (the wife of the one
just named) who was away wash-
ing a poor little motherless
Fijian baby, and returned home
only to find that her own dear
3


little one had died in her short
absence. 1 can tell of another
missionary who went from house
to house visiting the sick, and
almost compelling them to take
the medicines with which he sup-
plied them, when he himself was
so weak with his long continued
labours that one of the few young
men who were not attacked had
to accompany him with a chair on
which to sit, while he attended to
the wants of the people under his
care. But why multiply instances
when every mission station, and
almost every village in Fiji, can
furnish similar proofs that the
spirit of self-sacrifice and self-
denying love is as apparent now r
as it ever was in the old days of
heathenism.
As we went on our way up the
river we met a messenger bring-
ing a letter from one of the
native ministers to Mr. Webb.
The writer is stationed amongst
some of the mountain tribes, who
have but recently made a profes-
sion of Christianity. In addition
to the sad news that 1072 had
died in the section under his im-
mediate charge, we were told of
some towns whose people, under
the influence of superstition, and
imagining that this fearful scourge
was sent as a punishment for
abandoning the religion of their
fathers, had driven away their
teachers and returned to heathen-
ism ; and of one town where the
teacher having died they buried his
wife and child alive in the same
grave. These were dreadful tales
to hear as we steamed up that
beautiful river ; but we were
comforted by the recollection of
the many triumphs of the Gospel
amongst these people, by the
assurance that many of those
who were dead had manifested
the power of the religion of Jesus
both in life and in death, and by
the sure and certain trust that
God can make even this severe
trial an instrument of good both
to whites and to Fijians, to min-
isters and to people.
I shall not soon forget our
midnight voyage. It was a fine
clear night, and the calmly flow-
ing river reflected in a most
lovely manner the shadows of the
trees and of the hills, around the
bases of which it flowed on its
way to the sea. The silence was
unbroken, except by the fierce
puffing of our little launch as she
belched forth flame and smoke to
the surprise and admiration of
the natives, and especially of
some who were sitting in front of
their town, and who suddenly
broke the stillness of the night
by a most weird unearthly yell as
we passed close by them, which
was repeated with interest as the
engineer sounded the shrill steam
whistle for their amusement.
About 1 a.ra. we came to
anchor to wait for daylight. In
the morning we got some natives
to cut firewood for our return
passage down the river, as we
were anxious both to spare our
coals, and also to test the prac-
ticability of our using wood when-
ever we might run short of coals.
We were kindly entertained at
the residence of Mr. Storcks, a
gentleman who came here as
botanist with Dr. Seeman, and
has since made Fiji his home.
About noon we started down the
river, using wood only for fuel,
and found that we could manage
to make good way with it; in
fact,for a considerable distance we
maintained a full head of steam.
4


On our way down we passed
close to Beard Rock, so called
because any young Fijian who
wished to have his face orna-
mented with a good flowing beard
could easily have his Avish grati-
fied by rubbing his chin long
enough and hard enough on the
face of the rock. Just after we
passed that place we met a canoe
paddling up the river, and Mr.
Webb called out to me, “ See,
there’s Aisea Nasikai, one of the
two teachers who escaped when
Mr. Baker and party were
murdered and then the tale
was told how the poor fellow
rushed into the reeds when he
was struck, and crouched down
there, hearing the talk of the
murderers as they mutilated the
dead bodies. So nearly was ho
discovered that one of the men
who were looking for him actually
stood upon his foot. Whilst he
was hiding he heard the men
calling out for a light with which
to fire the reeds, in order to drive
him out, but fortunately they
went away without carrying their
purpose into effect. A few miles
further down we passed one of
the boats of H. M.S. Blanche, and
exchanged salutations with Capt,
Simpson, R.N., and some of his
officers, who were going up the
river, and so the past and the
present came very vividly before
us. Old cannibal Fiji, with the
yells of the murderers and the
beat of the death drum almost
sounding in our ears, and
a Crown colony of Great
Britain —the peaceful mission of
the survey ship and the quiet
homes of the planters on the
river’s banks.
Next day (28th) we reached
Ban, calling at Navuloa on our
way, and found it necessary to
send the “ Henry Reed ” to
Lev uka to bring the brethren
from there to consult about the
selection of teachers.
May 29th.—This morning we
found it necessary to detain the
steam launch until Monday, as
we found that by sending her to
tow two large canoes laden with
stores for Navnloa, and timber
for Rewa, we could release the
Jubilee at once, and allow her to
return to Levuka for another
cargo, thus expediting the dis-
charge of the “ John Wesley.”
Brother Fison, at no little incon-
venience to himself, kindly went
in charge of the launch and her
bulky companions.
On June Ist and 2nd we held
our meeting (see Appendix 1)
at Navuloa with the mission-
aries and native ministers,
and afterwards with the students.
The native minister who was
appointed to go with us was not
sufficiently recovered from his
illness to make it advisable for
him to fulfil his appointment,
and we found it difficult to get
another in his place. We had
plenty of volunteers from the
students ; in fact, they all volun-
teered, but some of them who
were married and well suited for
the work had to be passed by, on
account of difficulties connected
with their families. Six of the
married were selected, and three
single men, and with them we
hope to make a start on Monday
next. Good old Joel Bulu gave
the men who are going a stirring
address, and there was deep and
solemn feeling in the meeting as
he told them of his own experi-
ence in the days gone by in Fiji,
exhorted them to put their trust
in the same God who had watched


over and protected them in their earnest address by pointing them
labours in this land, and who had to the glorious reward which
so signally blessed them in their awaits the faithful soldier of the
work. He then finished his cross, i
(Letter from Rev. G. Brown , dated Levuka , Fiji, June 12, 1875.)
I have just finished a few lines
which you may find useful for the
Notices if you think them worth
publishing, I now prepare a few
lines to leave behind us, to await
the first chance to Sydney.
We hoped to have sailed to-
day, but the action taken by the
Government here has prevented
us. We heard a slight rumour
yesterday that they were going to
throw si me obstacles in our way,
and when the captain went to
clear the ship he was told that
he could not clear that day. An
Officer went on board, and the
report was circulated that they
were going to compel us to take
a life boat &e., &c. In the after-
noon a gentlemen waited upon me
with a letter from the Colonial
Secretary, which 1 now enclose.
(Appendix 2). 1 told him that 1
would gladly meet his Honor the
Administrator and the Executive
Council with the natives, and
named 11 a.m. to-day. In the
meantime we heard that two
gentlemen connected with the
Government had gone to the
teachers and asked them whether
they were going of their own free
will, how much salary they
were getting, &c., &c. They also
told them that they were being
sent to a race of cannibals, to a
place -where people were always
ill of a strange disease, (fever
and ague,) and where the food
was not such as they are accus-
tomed to, that they were going to
be left to themselves for many
months, and finished up by asking
them if there were no heathens
in Fiji to convert. This was
the account given by the native#
to us. The gentleman who
brought me the letter told me
that he was one of those who had
been sent to the teachers, but he
wished me to understand that
they had only done so in obedience
to orders, as the Government
wished to know from the natives
themselves on what conditions
they were being sent. I had
previously determined in my own
mind how I would act in any
negotiation with the Government,
so I simply said that I was very
glad indeed that ihe Govern-
ment manifested such a kindly
interest in the welfare of the
natives, and assured the officer
that we as a Society only wished
to secure the co-operation of the
Government in all matters affec-
ting the people under our care.
1 also said that 1 was very glad
that they had obtained the testi-
mony of the teachers in such an
independent way, as they must
now be certain that it was impos-
sible for us to have prepared
them for such an examination,
as we had not the slightest sus-
picion that the Government in-
tended to move in the matter.
I told him also that whilst we
were very glad that they had
seen the teachers, I as an indi-
vidual thought that they might
have manifested their confidence
and shewn a little simple courtesy
6


by informing us of their inter-
view, He seemed to feel this to
be true. * * * *
At 10 a.m. I got all the teach-
ers with their wives and children
together, and asked the medical
officer here to inspect them, as I
wished him to give us a clean
Bill of Health when we leave
here, so as to avoid if possible
r.ny quarantine in Samoa. He
examined them all, and is
perfectly satisfied with them.
On Monday morning he will
examine the crew and passengers
and will then give us a certificate
which I hope will be useful to
us.
At 11 a.m. to day I attended
at the Government buildings with
the teachers. The meeting was
held in the Executive Council
Chambers, and was composed of
His Honour the Administrator,
Messrs. Thurston, Horton,
Bentley, Frazer, Ratu Mele,
Ram Tevitu, Bcott (intrepreter )
Secretary of Council, myself and
the nine teachers.
1 was very kindly received
and had a chair given me next
to Mr. Layard. He told me
that the reason why the Govern-
ment wished to meet the teachers
and myself was, that' reports
were being circulated that the
men were not volunteers, that
they were being kept in ignorance
of the real facts of the case and
that as they were now British
subjects the Government, con-
sidered themselves to be respons-
ible for them, and therefore
wished to have the whole matter
fully explained to them. He also
told me that he had a dispatch
from home, which positively
iorbade any Fijians being taken
away to other groups, though he
scarcely thought that that disr
patch was meant to apply to such
a case us this.
1 replied by giving a short
account of the history of the
mission up to the present time,
telling him of our first instruc-
tions, of the alteration which was
made in Sydney when we heard
of the epidemic, of our arrival here,
and of our determining to carry
out the original plan, as we were
afraid of the quarantine laws at
Friendly Islands, &c., and because
the Health Officer here told us
that it was safer to take men who
had recovered from measles rather
than those who had never had
them. I then told them of the
selection of the first lot of volun-
teers, of the time which had been
given for consideration, the
number who had volunteered in
each circuit, &c. ; then of our
coming here and not being able
to collect these men, and so having
to make a second call for volun-
teers. I told them that in
response to that call the whole of
the students in Navuloa volun-
teered, that we had selected nine
of the number who were now
present, and finished by assuring
them that no one had spoken to
the teachers on the subject, and
that up to that very moment they
were in complete ignorance of the
reason for their being now pre-
sent. I then handed in the
Commodore’s letter and sat down.
Mr. Layard then addressed the
teachers through the interpreter,
and told them that they must
remember that they were now
British subjects —that no one lad
any right to compel them to go
to any place where they them-
selves did not wish to go, that
they were free to go and free to
7


stay ; that he was responsible for
their safety ; that if any of them
went away now and got killed
and eaten the Government here
would be blamed by the Home
Government, and so he wished
to tell them himself all about the
countries to which they were
being taken, and then to hear
from them their own opinion and
wishes. He then told them about
the people, that they were great
cannibals and very fierce; that
the islands were very unhealthy,
so that almost every one that
went there suffered much from
fever and ague ; that food might
be very scarce, and that although
we might take food with us, yet
it was not the food to which
Fijians were accu>tomed. He
told them that they would be lelt
alone without protection or sup-
port for some months, and asked
them to consider the matter, and
if after hearing what had been
told them they still wi: bed to go
he would not prevent them, but
would wish them God speed.
The teachers then asked if
they were to reply individually,
or if one could speak for them
all. Mr. Layard said that if they
had appointed one to speak he
could do so, or they could all
speak if they wished. At all
events, Amenio stood up, and
with deep feeling said that they
were n«*t surprised at what they
had just been told, that it was no
new thing to them, as they had
heard it all before from the mis-
sionaries before they volunteered
for the service. He said, “We
have fully considered this matter
in our hearts ; no one has pressed
us in any way. We have given
ourselves up to do this work, and
* if we die we die, and if we lire
we live.’ ” You may he sure I
was well pleased to hear th«
noble fellow speak out so well,
and his reply evidently made a.
good impression, but Mr. Layard
began again telling them of the
hardships endured by the London
Missionary Society’s teachers in
New Guinea, and read extracts,
from the Sydney Morning Herald
of May Bth. with the accounts of
the sufferings and death of teach-
ers and their wives. He then
touched ujon the shortness of
food, its unsuitability to the
Fijians, telling them again that
they were free to stay or to go
knowing all this that if they
went and wished to return, there
was plenty of work amongst the
mountaineers in Fiji, and then
talked again about disease, &c.
Here I thought that I had sat
quite long enough, and that it
was time for me to speak, and so
I told his Honour, in as quiet
and polite a manner as I possibly
could, that 1 thought he was only
frightening the natives unneces-
sarily ; that the dangers of the
work were being put before the
teachers, not as possible contin-
gencies, nor even as probable ones,
but as absolute certainties. 1
pointed out that there was a great
difference between the mangrove
flats of New Guinea and the
lagoon island to which we were
first going; that food, so far
from being scarce, was plentiful
indeed, and of the same descrip-
tion as in Fiji, and quoted as my
authority Captain Simpson, of
H.M.S. Blanche, then in port,
Captain Ferguson, Lieutenant
Sanders, &c.
Mr. Thurston here interposed,and
made an excellent speech, saying
that he quite concurred in what

I had just said about the teachers
being frightened, that he could
substantiate my statements about
the plentiful supply of food, as
several gentlemen had told him
about the immense terraces of
New Britain cultivated by the
natives and full of all kinds of
food, * He said, also, that it was
quite true that the Duke of York
Islandw as an atoll, and was pro-
bably healthy, though he believed
that on both the larger islands
there would be plenty of fever
and ague; but this should not
stand much in the way, as in
seven-tenths of the world we can
find plenty of that disease. He
said that, with his Honour’s per-
mission, he would put the matter
again before the teachers. This
he did, dwelling, however, more
particularly on the assurance that
the Government did not wish to
hinder them, but only to protect
them, and to be able to assure the
Home Government, in case any
of them got killed, that they
went of their own free will, and
knowing well the dangers to
which they were exposed. This
was interpreted to Mr. Layard
and the Government, after which
Mr. Layard asked me about terms
of service, payment, &c., to
which I replied by saying, that
when they were ill, or when from
any other cause it was deemed
right for any of them to return, we
considered ourselves pledged to
bring them back to Fiji. As to
payment, they went on the same
footing as our other teachers
placed in similar circumstances,
but that as soon as ever it was
practicable the people would be ex-
pected to support them. A paper
was then produced,which they were
asked to sign (Appendix 3). 1
objected to their doing so until
certain alterations were made,
after which the translation was
read over to them, and they all
said, “ It’s all right,” or “ It’s
all clear to us ”
After a little general conversa-
tion, and an expression of good
will and kind wishes from Mr.
Layard, the meeting adjoiirned.
I have not yet heard from them
as to whether there will be any
impediment now put in our way,
but I scarcely expect any further
difficulty. At all events, we are
preparing to go on Monday
morning, and I sincerely hope
nothing will occur to prevent us
from doing so. With regard to
to this action taken by the
Government, I scarcely know
what to say. Most people here
speak of it as a vexatious inter-
ference and a manifestation of
petty spite, but I do not look
upon it in that light. Mr. Layard
certainly seemed at one time to
be trying to frighten the teachers
against going, and I protested
against it, but whether he really
wished to stop them or not is, I
think, very doubtful. I myself give
the Government credit for sincerity
in the matter. They have instruc-
tions from home to look after
and protect the Fijians ;
and may beljeve that we
also are going to sacrifice our
men in some fanatical way. As
they suppose if any Fijians are
murdered in the islands to which
we are taking them, there will
be an enquiry made into the matter
as they are now British sub-
jects, and they naturally desire to


be in a position to prove that all
due precautions were taken by
them to protect the interests of
the people whom they are ap-
pointed to govern. Looked at
from this point of view, their
conduct is quite right and proper.
Mr. Layard told me that the
minutes of our meeting -Will be
forwarded home.
Many of the whites here
seem to have a most unreasonable
prejudice against the mission, and
I fear that we have at present the
earnest sympathy of but a very
few indeed of the European popu-
lation. You may ask why, and I
really cannot tell you. I have
tried to get hold of something
tangible —something that would
look like an accusation which
could be dealt with, but there is
really nothing at all. Perhaps
the secret is that they are jealous
of the influence which w r e have.
Some people here say that that
is the reason why we were re-
quei ted to meet the Administrator
and Executive Council ; that
the natives might know that the
Government might prevent our
going if they wished to do so.
However, I hope all will be right
in a short time now, “When
the Governor comes ” is now
quite a cant expression in Fiji.
His arrival is to usher in the new
era of peace and prosperity to
this group. Let us hope that
th« most sanguine expectations
will all be realized.
I must say a few words about
our detention here in Fiji. We
have now been here four weeks,
and yet X cannot say that we
could have got away a day earlier.
The great hindrance has been
with the customs. It was several
days before we could begin to
discharge, and then we could only
get out a few packages each day.
Bills of lading were wanting.
Invoices were wanting, the mani-
fest bad to be amended ; a new
manifest had to be made ; again
it must be amended. Goods
were hauled up on deck but had
to be put down again. At four
o’clock sight entries had to be
passed. Box after box had to be
opened, their contents taken out
and the duty calculated upon
every pound of pepper or package
of bath bricks, &c., and entries
passed before they could belauded.
It was really sickening, and I
assure you it needed all my
philosophy to enable me to keep
quiet. I got a good lesson, how-
ever, in Sydney. I am sure our
detention there was a providen-
tial one, and this may be.
Had we got away from Sydney
at the time first appointed we
should have been placed in a very
different position to that in which
we now are ; in fact, our expedi-
tion would probably have been
abandoned for this year. As it
is I have got a fine lot of men. I
really wonder how they stood
that ordeal before the Govern-
ment, it was a most trying one
to them and yet they passed
through it nobly. Mr. Layard
said to me after it was over that
it was most satisfactory, and all
the other members seemed to
concur in it. Every day as any
of our teachers pass along the
beach some friend of missions

going to preach here this evening
and I intend to say a few words
about our expedition.
Monday 14.—1 cannot add
much more to this letter, as I
must go and see Mr. Layard
about oiir clearance. After ser-
vice last night I met one of the
members of the Executive Council
(Mr. Frazer) and asked him
if he would come up with me to the
mission house. He did so, and
I read to him my account of the
meeting, as I wished to know if
it was correct before sending it to
you. He altered those words
about one of Mr.Layard’s answers
not being translated (quite unim-
portant,) and said that all the
rest was quite correct. We will,
I think, get away this afternoon.
I will write to you again from
Samoa.
(Letter from Rev. G. J3rown f dated Levuka , I 1 iji , June 14, 18i5)
I certainly did not expect to be
here this evening, nor did I
expect that I should have to write
to you again from this place, but
the captain was delayed in clear-
ing the ship and taking on board
some yams, until it was too late
in the afternoon to start. To-
morrow early is fixed for sailing.
I went down to see Mr. Layard
this morning, as I wished him to
give me some account of the
meeting of the Executive Council
which we attended, or some
certificate of their having made
such a full examination and
enquiry. He promised me that
minutes of the meeting shall be
sent to you. Did I tell you in
my other letter that I read over
the account of the meeting I have
sent to you to one of the members
of tL e council, and he said that
it was quite correct? Since 1
wrote to you I have received a
copy of the paper (see below)
which was translated and read
at the teachers at the meeting,
and to which each one indi-
vidually assented. They did
not sign the Fijian trans-
lation as it was a rough copy,
but their assent to it was
most unqualified, and this will be
certified by the Government.
The whole thing was a grand
triumph for us, and yet the
Government was not placed in
the position of a defeated party,
■but was rather considered by us
a helper. This takes away all
feelings of soreness, which is a
good thing. The Baron tells me
that Mr, Layard was both sur-
prised and pleased. I had a
really kind letter from Mr,
Thurston this evening wishing
us God speed, and assuring us
of the deep interest they will feel
in our voyage.
I do not know that I have
anything else to say, so I will
again ask an interest in your
prayers and wish you good-bye.
