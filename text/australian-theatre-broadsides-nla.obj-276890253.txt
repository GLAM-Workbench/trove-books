HER MAJESTY’S THEATRE.
“EAST LYNNE.”
“ East Lynne ” has always proved immensely
popular with, playgoers, and the fact is there-
fore all the more strange that for more than 10
years past the favourite stock piece has only
been staged from time to time as a stopgap.
Now that Mrs. Henry Wood’s story has been
revived at Her Majesty’s Theatre, an opportunity
is afforded of seeing an effective production of
the piece under Mr. Rignold’s management, and
as Saturday’s audience was manifestly touched
by the death-scene in the third-act; and every-
where followed the tale with interst, it is possible
that “East Lynne” may prove a profitable
revival on the spacious stage of Her Majesty’s.
Mr. Rignold’s new edition of the piece has
apparently aimed at conciseness with a view to
hastening the action of the story, and it furnished
a novel incident in the railway accident, which
was received with loud applause. Mr. Rignold
follows Mr. T. A. Palmer’s verson, one of the
best ever written, in dividing the drama into a
prologue and four acts Saturday’s
representation was of an even character through-
out, disclosing exceptional strength only in the
episode of Willie’s death, which was touchingly
expressed by all concerned in the scene. Miss
Lilia Wilde’s outburst of grief as Mme. Vine, as
she stood over the little bed which bore the
dead body of her child, was strongly shown.
Miss Eoland Watts-Phillips displayed deep feel-
ing in a natural way as Joyce, the faithful
servant; and little Albion Whyte held the
audience throughout by the unaffected pathos
of her delivery of Willie’s dying speeches. The
little actress is the best Willie the present writer
has seen, and deservedly shared with Miss Wilde
in the hearty call before the curtain which
followed. Mr. J. W. Hazlitt, a manly, though
somewhat sombre, Archibald Carlyle; was at his
best in the scene in which Lady Isabel first
entraps her husband by soothing words into
avowing his innocent affection for Barbara
Hare, and then accuses him of treachery. Mr.
Albert Norman was well placed as Sir Francis
Levison. Miss Flora Anstead repeated her
excellent impersonation of that good-hearted
shrew, “Corney” Carlyle, Miss Hilda Spong
made an engaging Barbara Hare, reading the
.character intelligently from an entirely sym-
pathetic standpoint; and Mr. Cyril Keightly
■bowed earnestness as Richard Hare. Mr. J. W.
Sweeney filled ont with unctuous humour the
Bart of Bullock; Miss Eileen Harvie as Afy
■allijohn drew a not ineffective picture of a
Kdgar rustic coquette ; and Mr. Stirling Whyte
■ Lord Mount Severn, Mr. Frank Harcourt as
Bthell, the poacher : Mr. Arthur Rigby as Mr.

as you do, because you don’t have the
trouble of getting ’em through your
hair.”
A stingy man, who pretended to be fond
of his horse, but kept him nearly starved
said to a friend, “You don’t know how
much we all think of that horse. I
shall have him stuffed, so as to preserve
him, when he dies.”—“ You’d better
stuff him now,” retorted his friend, so as
to preserve him living.”

CRITERION THEATRE.
“WALKER, LONDON.”
“ Walker, London,” the amusing piece pro-
duced at the Criterion Theatre on Saturday, is
chiefly remarkable because it is not remarkable.
Erom the author of “ Auld Licht Idylls ” almost
anything might have been reasonably expected
rather than a farcical comedy so entirely to the
taste of old playgoers as this merry little piece.
Many an old playwright would
have hesitated to take in hand the task Mr.
Barrie has set himself in this delightful little
piece; hut there is really not a trace of the
’prentice hand in the carrying on of the dialogue
under conditions which at first sight appear dis-
abling, and the three acts of the story run as
brightly as possible in the beautiful framework
which surrounds them at the Criterion Theatre.
Mr. W. B. Spong has painted a singularly
picturesque scene which, to many Australians,
has the added charm of novelty. The houseboat
itself, with its gaudy colouring an. - Noah’s
Ark-like appearance, is to us here a strange
feature in the landscape, and the view of the
Thames at Cookhaip, with the ancient red-roofed
house in the distance embosomed in trees, whose
foliage is massed with light and airy effect, forms
a background which vividly recalls the dear old
river to all who know its green eyots and in-
numerable pleasure-haunts. In the last act,
where all this is disclosed by night, the manage-
ment of the lights was so good, as to give the
effect of afresh scene, and the audience again
heartily applauded the painter’s art. Moreover,
the choral singing on the punt, as the youthful
party row to and from their floating home, was
excellent. and whatever difficulty may have
existed carrying on the piece smoothly was
effectually concealed by the actors, Mr. Bouci-
cault’s stage-management causing all to go very
evenly throughout. The last act was one long
scream of laughter, and the whole piece, in
which there is a certain delicacy which has a
special charm, proved a pronounced success. —
