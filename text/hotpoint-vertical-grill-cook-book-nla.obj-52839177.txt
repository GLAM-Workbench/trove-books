Make the most of your
HOTPOINT
Vertical Grill




NEW
“NO-TURN” WAY TO GRILL
TWICE AS FAST,
WITH TWICE THE FLAVOUR
Perfect grilling depends upon fast sealing and rapid, even
cooking. This captures the meat’s natural juices and flavour
. . . keeps it tender and tasty.
Now all grills can be like that—with the new Hotpoint Vertical
Grill . . . first-ever “upright” griller.
Before starting work on the slim, table-top Grill, Hotpoint
designers surveyed a complete cross-section of housewives to
obtain their views on conventional grilling appliances.
From their findings they developed the Vertical Grill, with its
drop-in grid between twin infra-red grilling elements. It seals
meat instantly and cooks it both sides at once with a gentle
“self-basting” effect—all without turning.
Here is an entirely new angle on grilling. Quicker. Cleaner.
More convenient. With no smoke, no spitting and splashing
fat, as with ordinary grillers. And washing-up is so much
easier!
Enjoy more delicious eating, with less expensive cuts of
meat, with your HOTPOINT Vertical Grill.
Here are the simple directions and a collection of tempting
recipes to guide you!
With the compliments of HOTPOINT.


HOW VERTICAL GRILL WORKS
Drop-in grid lowers into grilling slot.
7-point heat selector lets you control
heat exactly for any thickness of meat,
sausages, hamburgers, kebabs, sand-
wiches, etc.
A special set of hamburger moulds is
provided to shape ’burgers and hold
them securely in the grid-
The
Inside
Story
Meat is sealed instantly both
sides, so juices do not run out.
Twin elements grill meat evenly
both sides at once in half the
time taken by ordinary grillers.
No need to turn whilst cooking!
Melting fat trickles downward,
with gentle “basting” effect
. . . keeps meat tender and
succulent. And no “smoking!”
Covered drip-tray collects fat.
Tray and inner side panels
both remove for fast, easy
cleaning.


EASY CLEANING HINTS
Empty fat and wash the non-smoke
drip-tray and its lid each time you
grill. Use hot water and your
favourite detergent. Replace lid
and slide back into position.
Wipe over deep-chromed lid with
detergent and water. {This is
easier to do while the Grill is still
warm.) No steel wool or scratchy
cleaners, please. Occasionally you
can wipe over textured-chrome
sides, too.
Wash drop-in grid just as you do
an ordinary griller grid. The teak-
toned handles are acrylic-finished
. . . completely heatproof, water-
proof and stain-resistant.
Occasionally remove lid. lift out
inner side panels, wash in hot
detergent suds. Your Vertical Grill
practically cleans itself with its
own dry heat. Grilling efficiency
is in no way affected if side panels
become heat-discoloured.

GENERAL GRILLING TIPS
1. Always let frozen or refriger-
ated meat thaw up to room
temperature before grilling.
2. For best results, switch on
Grill, set heat-selector on “Hi”
and pre-heat for 4-5 minutes.
3. Remove drop-in grid whilst
pre-heating and preparing meat.
To load grid; pack evenly,
placing meats in centre of grid
first, then working to sides and
base.
4. Close grid and lower into
grilling slot. Leave for time
recommended in Grilling Table
(pages 9 and 10), reducing heat
as directed when specially
“well-done” grills are wanted.
5. Have serving platter or heat-
proof board ready to rest grid on,
then remove and open.


Preparing Your Grills
Steak and Chops. Trim away fat to
your liking, and flatten as usual. Pre-
season to taste. Rub in salt and
pepper, or rub over with cut clove of
garlic.
Tenderise less expensive cuts such as
Round Steak, Blade or Oyster-Blade
by lightly pounding with kitchen
mallet or wooden knife-handle. Cut
the sinew in the Blade in several
places.
Arrange meat with fat to top of Grill,
to encourage basting effect. Chops
are best packed “head to tail” with
tails curled up, as in the sketch.
This way, up to 8 chops (or 4 large
steaks) can be cooked at once.
Sausages and Frankfurts. Pack into
grid "standing up,” so that they lie
parallel with bars of grid. Brush
lightly with cooking oil or butter. Do
not prick.
Kidneys. Cut in half lengthwise, and
brush lightly with cooking oil or
butter. (They have little or no fat to
baste themselves.)
Chicken. Brush pieces with oil and
lemon juice, then season and grill.
When grilling chicken halves, remove
backbone. Use only birds up to 2 lbs.
in weight.
Fish. Thicker fillets should be lightly
brushed with cooking oil or melted
butter and milk, to taste.
Bacon Rashers. Lay rasher between
pairs of hamburger moulds to act as
packing, and place in grid. When
grilling bacon as garnish only, simply
slip in beside chops or other meat for
last 3-5 minutes of cooking.
