ON THE
i finis'
CREDIT FONCIER.
BY F. LOPRIENO.
In December, 1888, I contributed an article to the Building Societies’ Gazette
on the Credit Foncier, but the necessity for its introduction into Australia not
being as great as now, the article did not attract much public attention. The
Credit Foncier now being the question of the day, the extensive practical
knowledge I have had in the working of the system impels me to put in as brief a
form as possible the following information, showing how the simplicity, practica-
bility, and general advantages of the Credit Foncier would tend to release this
abnormal state of congestion that exists amongst Victorian land holders at the
present juncture. The information supplied herewith has been gained from years
of close personal application to all branches of the Credit Foncier, in one of the
leading institutions of the kind, and therefore may be taken by all interested as
the basi's upon which to establish similar institutions in Victoria on sound and
permanent foundations.
If we examine superficially the conditions of real estate ownership it seems
that to this class of property more than to any other should flow the savings of
those who wish to invest. Real estate indeed, at first sight, offers a guarantee
that in appearance is the most solid and surest of all investments. However, the
contrary is too often the result. A business transaction does not present any
guarantee, but the personal honesty of the debtor and the good opinion the
creditor has of his debtor’s solvency. These two conditions obtain credit which
does not attend real property on which usury is more exorbitant. In normal
times it is not rare to see capitalists satisfied in investing their money temporarily
at 4 per cent, and often less. The interest on mortgages, on the other hand, is
never less than 5 per cent., in addition to which there are the necessary heavy
expenses incurred in the many formalities required by law. Altogether, then, it
will be seen that agriculture generally, under our present system, is oppressed
with heavy interest, and consequently cannot progress. Stagnation of agricultural
production is the inevitable result, and the whole community suffers to a corres-
ponding degree. If we search for the reason of this, we shall find that the first
is in the nature of real property itself, and consists in the difficulty in which it is
possible to put on a par the rent of the soil with that of the capital, so as to pay
the interest and return the borrowed money. In borrowing there is a great
difference between the merchant and the landed proprietor. Both undertake to
repay interest and capital in a certain time, but the merchant by the rapidity of
commercial circulation renews his capital quickly. The money he advances in
his speculations, if soundly invested, \ returns to him quickly, increased with the
profits of his transactions. He can, therefore redeem his debt in a short time
and pay a fair interest that the condition of the money market fixes from time to
time. It is not so with the owner of land, however, who, having obtained an
advance to buy a property or improve a farm, receives but a poor annual return
from the capital he has invested in the soil. He has generally to pay
an interest of 6 or 7 per cent, besides expenses, while his property,
in many instances, returns less; but even if the value of the returns
from the soil be equal to the interest on the borrowed capital, this will not put him
out of his trouble. When the mortgage expires he has to refund the amount
borrowed. Has he been able to succeed in doing this by dint of small annuities
and savings ? If he has not, he is obliged to enter into a new sacrifice to satisfy
the first creditor, and to renew his engagement with new lenders and again
pay all the heavy original expenses.
There is another notable difference between business and landed property.
The commercial credit is organised ; the credit for land is not much recognised.
While the financial institutions are a criterion of commercial transactions, similar


Its transactions are :
institutions for real property are few in number. The landed proprietor who
wants money is obliged to go in search of a capitalist who is willing to lend.
This means a high rate of interest, and various other disadvantages. The
experience of the trader is just the opposite of this, as he generally finds that
money is freely offered at a fair rate of interest. Again : the capitalist, when
advancing on mortgage, fixes his own conditions, while in commercial transac-
tions, the capitalist, having more competiton, has very often to accept those of
the borrower. The unfavourable condition of the property holder is intensified
by another cause, namely, the number of excellent investments offered now-a-
days in Government, Corporation, and large companies stocks. Another im-
portant point, too, to be considered is that mortgages, under our present system,
share the immobility of the soil, and consequently do not possess the facility for
circulation sufficient to attract capitalists to invest in real property at a reason-
able rate of interest. The transfer of mortgages, it may be further mentioned,
requires too many formalities, and entails so much expense that to a large extent
hampers this kind of business,
It was in Germany that the Credit Fonder was first organised under the
name of Landschaftsbanken, which are associations of proprietors who issue
pfandbriefe (letters of mortgage) giving as security a mortgage on their proper-
ties. and repaying their debts by annuities. The success obtained encouraged
other countries to adopt the same system. Several European States encouraged
their establishment with substantial subsidies. In others, the provincial authori-
ties took charge of their management; but it is in Germany that the beneficial
influences of the Credit Foncier are most clearly exemplified. In France the
Credit Foncier was established with decret 28th February 1852, on a somewhat
different basis, and now the French pattern is to be found in nearly all countries,
even in the land of its birth—Germany.
(a) —To advance on freehold properties.
(7>)—To make such mortgages repayable by annuities, such annuities
including sinking fund, interest, commission to the Credit Foncier, and taxes to
the Government, the annuities extending over a long period of years.
(r) —To issue letters of mortgage as such advances are made.
There are several methods of making this kind of transaction. They are :
(1) By paying loans granted to borrowers in these letters of mortgage at their
face value. The borrower sells them on the market at the current prices. This
has the advantage of simplicity and speed in the transaction of business, does not
expose the institution to any loss of interest, and letters of mortgage being put
into circulation as loans are made, the number of loans can be put on the letters
of mortgage, which is an easy and effective check that no letters have been issued
in excess. The method lam now describing has proved to be very convenient in
the hands of large financial institutions of good repute, long established and
cautious. In such cases letters of mortgage are usually sold at par. When issued
on the other hand by financial institutions, little known, and not possessing the
confidence of the public, fluctuations in price are usual, and borrowers are never
sure about the amount they can realise. Moreover, at times, through their
inexperience of the market, they may sell them below their real value and so
cause a general depreciation of the value of the security. When this happens
customers sometimes leave the Credit Foncier which tends to discredit the system.
Besides this, in times of tightness of the money market small owners who would
find it difficult to obtain credit elsewhere would direct their steps to the Credit
Foncier and have their properties mortgaged and perhaps sell the letters at a
great discount. Country people would experience some inconvenience in selling
letters of mortgage. To obviate this inconvenience Credit Foncier will, if
required by borrowers, pay letters of mortgage in cash, but the price of such
letters are fixed from time to time by the institutions doing the business. This
price is the one obtained from the sale, less the commission for the transaction.
This is a very good practice, as it enables the Credit Foncier to keep the price of
the letters at par.
(2) By floating little parcels at times.
(3) By floating large parcels and fixing the price. In cases of this kind,
however, it is difficult to keep proper control of the number of the loan on the
letter of mortgage.


JASSST/FinKT
By the Credit Fonder taking mortgages at face value of letters of mortgage,
the price of the letters is of great importance to borrowers, for if they are sold at
a discount the borrowers would be obliged to ask a loan for a larger amount, and
so the property would not present a sufficient margin for a second mortgage
should that be required ; besides, in the case of an income tax the holders of
letters of mortgage, or better, the borrowers, would be overcharged, as such tax
would be imposed on the nominal value of the letters.
The best annuities tables to be used are those appended hereto.
Another important question fbr Credit Foncier and building societies is the
mode of keeping mortgage accounts. A. Scrachley, a great authority on the
subject says:—
" The amount which a borrower has to pay on redemption of his security
has too often been a cause of litigation. It is important, therefore, that the
account with each borrower should be so kept by the society as to show in a clear
manner the extent to which he has discharged the various payments that he is
bound to make under the mortgage deed and the rules of the society. Thus, if
a member borrows for which he agrees to pay 15s. per month for
10 years (total, £1416) in the discharge of principal and interest, the facts, which
the account should establish, are not as to how the principal is discharged,
because that, with the interest, is merged in the repayment annuity for the
fixed term of years, but to what extent the covenanted /1410 has been liquidated,
which the monthly payment of £i\ 15s. for 10 years represents. This will be
accomplished by debiting the borrower with the full amount secured by his
mortgage, in other words, with the product of the monthly payment multiplied by
the number of periods in the whole annuity term.”
This mode of keeping accounts is not only more speedy, but it is the only
correct one. What has a borrower got to do in paying off his loan ? Simply
this : He pays the present value of all annuities for the remaining term of the
loan. It is therefore a matter of great surprise for me to find financial
institutions in Melbourne, which should know something about this kind of
business, charging the interest yearly. This practice gives more work and is not
in accordance with the agreement signed by the borrower, which provides for his
having to pay a fortnightly rent (annnuity) for a fixed number of years.
The success of Credit Foncier depends immensely on the greater or smaller
demand for the letters of mortgage on the part of the public, on the institutions
issuing the letters, on the general conditions of credit and the market, and more
especially on the security and advantages which the letters of mortgage offer.
As to security, it is one of the fullest, for the following reasons ;
(a) There is not the least doubt as to the legal value of the morgages,
specially qualified barristers being employed by the institute.
( b ) The maximum amount advanced being 50 per cent, on permanent and
uniform rent-producing properties.
(r) With every payment made by borrowers this margin is increased.
( d ) No letters of mortgage can be issued without a corresponding mortgage
being taken.
( e ) The capital and reserve fund of the Credit Foncier is always an
additional guarantee.
(/) Such kind of transactions being done by large institutions, regularity of
payment of principal and interest is secured to the holder of letters of mortgage,
which regularity would be an Utopia had the capitalist lent his money direct to
the mortgagor.
The advantages of this kind of security are .
(a) Great facility of negotiation, namely from hand to hand if letters are to
bearer. A simple endorsement has to be registered in the books of the Credit
Foncier if such letters are inscribed.
( p ) Letters may be inscribed in one name and coupons attached, for payment
of interest, in some other person’s name, or letters may be in the name of a person
and coupons payable to bearer.
(c) Interest being payable by coupons, these, when due, may be paid into a
bank, as ordinary cheques ; can be discounted at any time before their maturity ;
or can be transmitted from one place to another for payment.
(d~) A single rate of interest, when possible is another real advantage, as
this facilitates somewhat the circulation of letters of mortgage,

On lodgment of letters of mortgage, financial institutions generally advance
up to four-fifths of their market value, discount bills with a less number of
signatures than are usually required, and grant overdrafts so that if a borrower
who has received letters of mortgage from the Credit Fonder (first method)
believes in a coming rise in the price, and immediately required only a part of the
money, he has simpty to ask and can easily obtain an advance. He can then
wait for a favorable opportunity to sell, so that the advance can have a beneficial
influence on the course of said securities. These facilities are a great inducement
for business people to invest in letters of mortgage, which are invariably in great
demand amongst all classes who wish to invest trust money as well as money
belonging to corporations, minors, incapacitated persons, etc., and they form part
of the reserve funds of public and financial institutions.
The issue of letters of mortgages of small value, say £5, will attract small
savings to the real property, with advantage to both. The borrower has the
privilege of redeeming his loan at any time, a small charge on the redeeming value
being made by the Credit Fonder. Such loan can be paid either in full or in
part with cash or letters of mortgage, which should belong to the same series of
the loan to be redeemed. The value of these letters of mortgage is always
reckoned at par.
The duration of the loan is from five to seventy-five years. They are
generally made repayable in fifty years, but are usually paid off in an average of
thirty-nine years. The rate of interest paid to holders of letters of mortgage can
be reduced by the Credit Fonder, but after a certain time the interest on the
loans, that caused their issue, has to be reduced in the same measure. The
paying off with letters of mortgage, the reduction in the rate of interest on same,
and the payment by ballot, tend to make the value of such securities very steady
at a price about par, therefore the letters do not form an object of speculation,
but are eagerly sought after by prudent investors, principally because commercial,
as well as pclitical events, have very little influence on their course. The course
ot Prussian Pfandbriefe, 4 per cent., in the year 1808 (disaster of Jena) was 84 to
86 per cent., while the French Rente, 5 per cent., ruled at 70 to 75 per cent
After the year 1837 they were as high as 105 per cent. In that year they were
converted into per cent, and still they did not decline below par (so much was
the public trust in them), while the Government stock of the same country giving
a higher rate of interest was at a discount.
Another very notable example is that of the French Lettres de Gage. During
the last war with Germany they rose in the same measure as other securities fell,
because investors were getting rid of other securities they held in order to invest
in Lettres de Gage.
It is a practice with some Credit Fonder to charge a fixed commission on
the full amount of the loan for the whole term, which commission is included in
the annuity paid by borrowers. Such a practice, as it is clearly seen, is very
hard on the borrower, especially in the latter years of the loan, inasmuch as the
amount owing by him is decreasing with every repayment he makes. Therefore
it offers an inducement to him to repay his loan in full, but never in part, before
maturity, with the view of taking a fresh one in order to pay less commission.
This practice causes extra work to the institution, without its deriving any corres-
ponding benefit. When a fixed commission is charged, the rate of interest
charged on loans is at the same rate as the institution pays on the letters of
mortgage, commission in this case being the profit. A charge of so much per
cent, more on loans than is paid on letters of mortgage would be more equitable
and an act of sounder administration. This practice is now followed by the
Credit Fonder de France, since the introduction of table c at 5 per cent, and fr.
0.30 per cent, commission on the principal due. I said that the proportional
commission is fair, because it is charged for preliminary and working expenses
and delcredere given to holders of letters of mortgage. Now, since the amount
owing by borrowers is decreasing with every payment, the delcredere should be
reduced in the same proportion.
The margin required in granting loans is a matter of great importance,
because on it depends to the greatest extent the demand and, consequently, the
price that can be obtained for letters of mortgage. The larger the margin, the
greater is the demand for letters of mortgage, and that is a greater guarantee to
the lender, and an indirect benefit to the mortgagor, who will realise more for his
letters and, consequently, pay less for money borrowed. Such margin depends
on the nature and locality of property mortgaged, on the term of the loans, on the


purpose to which the money is to be applied (if for improvement of property
mortgaged, for instance, a less margin ought to satisfy the board of directors), and
on the frequency of the payments of annuities —whether monthly, quarterly, or
half-yearly. In any case the annuity for a long term loan should always be less
than the nett rent received from the mortgaged security, in order to guarantee
the Credit Foncier from loss in case of foreclosure.
Letters of mortgages are paid by ballot according to the principal received in
cash from each series. The part of the principal contained in the arrears is to be
considered as paid. Some societies have only one ballot, without distinction of
series : such practice, if it has the advantage of simplicity, has against it the fact
of putting holders of old letters of mortgage on an unfair footing. A loan made,
say, fifty years ago, has a larger margin than the one issued a few months ago ;
therefore the security of the letter issued with the fifty years old loan has an
ampler security than one issued a few months ago. Now, if the latter is applied
in payment of the fifty years loan, it is an act of injustice, although there is
ample security at the issue of every letter.
There are as many ballots as series, and as often as repayments are made;
therefore the total face value of letters of mortgage in circulation, with capital
and reserve fund of the society, at such times should never exceed the total
amount of redeeming value of loans. Transactions of Credit Foncier are
generally entered into by savings banks, corporations, or large public companies.
The repayment of loans by annuities extending over a long number of years
is very convenient for the farmer, and it is the only one practicable for him ; it
offers the advantage of repaying the loan in proportion with the increased
revenue from the property. Farmers do not receive principal and profit in globo,
but in fractions spread over a considerable number of years. Such fractions are
difficult to be invested at the same rate of interest that he is paying on his loans
in order to form a sinking fund to meet the payment of principal when due. If
such annuities could be made payable soon after harvest, another benefit would
be realised by the farmer, as this would enable him to invest without delay the
money he receives fiom the sale of his produce. Yet another benefit derived to the
proprietors of real estate from the institution of Credit Foncier is that the rate of
interest for mortgages is lowered, as it has been proved by experience that
capitalists prefer to invest in liquid securities. This the Credit Foncier obtains
by means of the letter of mortgage. So it is possible for the farmer with a lower
rate of interest to improve his property and render it easier for him to remain on
the land and compete with success.
In Victoria the Government guarantee is a great means to induce the most
sceptical capitalist to invest in this unequalled sound security, and I feel quite
sure that even with a low rate of interest said security will always command
par.
Much can be said on the different systems of Credit Foncier, and the many
details on the practical working of them, but it would be of no interest to the
general reader.
The subjoined statistical data will give an idea of the progress and scope of
these institutions in France and Italy, where much good has been done in the last
two years by the recently established Institute Italiano di Credito Fondiaro.
The calculations are in Italian Lire (francs) of which 25-221 equal £l.
