?It matters so much to England
What you will try to do ?
You can, if you will,
Make her greater still;
It lies little Maid with you.?
(From the Girl Guide Hand Book)


Qottage in "Berkshire .
The old Home of the Nightingales
since 1562.


(jreat grandmother's 3\4ap
When George the Third ruled Englishmen
Ann Nightingale, a child of ten,
Worked upon a silken ground
A map of England, and she crowned
The Channels and the Irish Sea
With Nelson?s ship, ?The Victory?.
And there the proud Britannia holds
Her shield and sceptre, and the folds
Of England?s flag are floating free
Over the Island and the sea.
Dear little girl, we sometimes fear,
In working this you shed a tear:
But pride of England mastered you,
And helped in what you had to do.
Were you as fond of History
As Jane and Pat and Rosemary?
Did Raleigh, Nelson, Howe, and Drake
Help you the stitches fair to make?
And did you read of Captain Cook
In your small-printed History book?
Little you thought to cross the seas
To one of England?s colonies;
Yet here?s the map in Grannie?s house
High admiration to arouse ?
A work of art for all to see,
And marvelled at by Jane and me!

Grandfather Lovegrove was alive
In Eighteen Hundred and Thirty-live.
A Bluecoat Boy was Grandpa ?he
Wore yellow stockings to the knee j
And after Morning Prayers were read
A Bluecoat Boy would make his bed,
And Grandpa, when he made his, said:
?None turns it down like me! ?
On London Bridge he used to go
To watch the boats dip to and fro,
And there was much talk of the Sea
In those days ?Emigrant ships went silently
From London-town and Plymouth-Ho,
?The Rapid?, and ?The Buffalo?,
?The Coromandel?: I will go
Thought Grandpa meditatively.
So Grandpa, when a wife he led
Unto a Greyfriars altar, said:
?We will adventure life anew
In Colonies across the Blue?.
Embarking in the ?Troubadour?
They sailing were three months, and more
Until they came to Adelaide shore
In Eighteen Fifty-two.
Good Colonists they proved to be 5
d hey brought up James and Emily,
Arthur and Richard and Annette,
Jane, Fanny, John and Margarett:
Miss Light, the Colonel?s sister had
A school for boys; the daughters read
?The Child?s Companion?, learnt to add
And worked a Sampler neat.

And Grandpa at his Pharmacy
Could always find a remedy;
He chatted with the boys and men
Who rode up for his medicine 5
They used to say he did them good
More than the Physic ever could:
Grandpa was never rough or rude,
He was a gentleman.
Grannie and Grandpa all their days
Kept still the homely English ways;
The Family Bible, Grandpa, he
Read night and morning faithfully.
And on the morning Grandpa died,
They found the bed was turned down wide
In readiness for sleep?beside,
None turned it down like he!

Pleasant Qottage
A t Penwortham, in days gone by,
JOl There lived at Pleasant Cottage
Aunt Kate and Uncle Malachi:
Great Aunt and Uncle Nottage.
We children used to stay there on
Our way up to Nilpena,
And in the evenings Cousin John
Would play his concertina.
Uncle read Mr. Alkenside
On ?Joys of Imagination?,
Aunt by the fire her mending plied,
Or made a renovation.
And if we children at a game
Did argue, fight, or quarrel,
A quiet reproof from Uncle came,
Pointing a little moral:
?Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
It is their nature to ?
But children must behave aright:
Now please! No more ado! ?
Auntie to Church her bonnet wore,
Uncle, his grey bell-topper;
And Uncle, pausing at the door,
WTmld give us each a copper.
And after Service we would see
The grave of Cousin Flora,
And that of our Great-Grandpa Lee;
And Horrocks, the Explorer!

Lucky Finn\ 184^
The boys and girls of old Penzance,
Truro, Redruth, and Newlyn?
Threw pebbles in the Madron Well
Asking its depths their fates to tell:
?What luck, blue deeps of Madron??
?One takes the road?, the waters said,
?By stages up to London.
One in the ?RockeF train will ride
To Manchester, and take his bride?
Rippled the sparkling Madron.
From Plymouth, on a ship, a few
Will sail into the Southland:
?Remember Cornwall, the old Home,
When to strange waters ye are come?
Cautioned the waves of Madron.
Of all that laughter-loving band,
Throwing for luck at Madron:
A shepherd left the Cornish rills,
And came at last to Burra hills
After the storms of Neptune.
H was here he found the copper-ore
Outcroppings; ?Now, by Madron!
Eighteen Hundred Forty-five
Brings luck to man and boy alive:
The Mine is worth a fortune! ?
And, oh, ye emerald Malachites!
\ e azure deeps of Madron!
A harvest of five million pounds
Was taken from those Burra mounds ?
What luck! What chance! What fortune!

Cornwall, the dear old Home.
The Last House,
Land's End.


Grannie
Twas Grannie who lived near the old Burra Mine,
And we often went up on a Sunday to dine
At Redruth, where Grannie lived. Grannie would tell
Us stories of Cornwall when she was a ?gel?.
Oh, not in the world was a country so fine
As Cornwall.
Grannie remembered old Dolly Pentreath,
Whose age was a hundred and two at her death.
And Grannie said Dolly was Cornish all through,
And spoke in the language?no other she knew:
The last to speak Cornish was Dolly Pentreath
Of Cornwall.
Hardy were Grannie?s folk: Jane Kalynak
Walked up from Cornwall to London and back
To the Great Exhibition, and she eighty-two;
Her Majesty saw what the Cornish could do,
And the Colonies asked her to send ?Cousin Jack?
From Cornwall.
Miners were Grannie?s folk: many a one
Came out when big Burra Mine was begun,
And a Cornishman walking on Sugar-Loaf crest
Would wish he were back at Land?s End in the west:
The last of old England lit up by the sun,
Old Cornwall.
A cellar had Grannie?s house, under the ground,
With little dark passages running around:
Grannie would go with a candle before,
And we would be miners a-searching for ore:
And Grannie said, ?Never was more copper found
In Cornwall! ?

Tfoyalty
The sunny South Australian Spring
of Eighteen Sixty-seven did bring
A Royal visitor. By day and night
A sharp look-out was kept for sight
Of sail and rigging, and at last
?The Galatea? was anchored fast
Down at Glenelg, in Holdfast Bay,
Bringing Prince Alfred here to stay.
Up at Mt. Lofty bonfires blazed,
Down in the City seats were raised,
And messages flashed everywhere
?The Duke of Edinbro? is here?.
The Country Folk tripped into town,
The Squatters from the North came down
The whole of Adelaide was en fete ,
And everybody stayed up late.
Aunt Emma went with her Papa,
Jane, Fanny, William, and Mama,
Agog to see the kindly Duke
We read of in the History Book.
And Auntie in her leghorn hat,
And new ?Alpaca?, went and sat,
The Sunday scholars all between,
To sing with zest, ?God save the Queen! ?


Qhapel. , 1895
Mr. Bartholomew comes from the Mill
Nodding to this one or other:
He carries a Bible inscribed: ?To Will,
With the kind thoughts and prayers of his Mother?.
Bartholomew tells us he came Oversea,
With a Wesleyan Captain aboard,
And when land came in sight of ?The Duke of York?, he
Says, ?We knelt and gave thanks to the Lord?.
And now, when the Methodists go to rejoice,
Bartholomew likes to be there,
Praising the Lord with a big, powerful voice?
And the minister leading in prayer!
Tavistock Bell
There was an old sailor in Blinman, and he
Came from Tavistock village in Devon countree j
He was from Tavistock ?village of Drake,
Who tackled the Spaniards when life was at stake
In Tavistock, Devon Countree.
This salty old sailor, when he was a lad,
Packed in a chest the belongings he had j
He took to the sea and to hauling a rope,
And he weathered the storms round the Cape of
Good Hope,
He left Devon when he was a lad.
He came up to Blinman in Flinders countree,
Longing a bit of old Devon to see.
A bell began ringing up in the Church ground,
And ?going to look?the sailor he found
?Twas from Tavistock ?Devon countree!

Roseville
In Roseville in the long ago they built a House
of God,
And down the years we worship where those
Pioneers have trod.
From cottages the workmen came along the River
Flats;
The Vardys and the Picketts came, the Blenkinsopps
and Spratts.
Roses lit the Altar, and the glory of the Lord
Shone round about the Sanctuary where Holy Writ
was heard.
The bells rang out in Roseville for a Marriage or
a Feast:
The children sang for those who lay with feet to-
wards the East.
And life is much the same to-day
in Roseville.
