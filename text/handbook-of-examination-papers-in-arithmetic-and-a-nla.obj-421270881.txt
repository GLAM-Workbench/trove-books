PREFACE.
In the study of Elementary Algebra, difficulties often arise
through want of a proper appreciation of the principles of
the science. Students prefer to hurry on to the working
of examples without thoroughly understanding the rules,
consequently their work becomes merely mechanical. These
difficulties are most frequently met with in that important
and interesting branch of the subject—Factorial Analysis—
which all but the best students fail to thoroughly master.
This arises partly from want of attention at the commence-
ment of their studies, but is especially due to the fact that
the rules are not usually stated in general terms. To enable
students to overcome these difficulties, sixteen of the most
important rules in Algebra, and especially those bearing on
factors, have been given in general terms. These rules
should be carefully committed to memory and again and
again referred to as required, until they are thoroughly
mastered. In most cases, in addition to the rules examples
have been given to illustrate their use.
The Arithmetical questions have been treated in a similar
manner to those previously published, with the exception
of those questions which deal with the principles of
Arithmetic. In these cases the proofs have been given in
full, in preference to referring students to books that may
not always be at hand.

ANSWERS TO ALGEBRA.




ALGEBRAICAL RULES.
The following Rules should he carefully committed to memory, and
referred to again and again as required: —
Rule I. —Division.
The terms of the Divisor and Dividend should always
be arranged in descending or ascending powers of one
of the symbols. The terms of each remainder must be
arranged in the same order.
Rule ll.—The square of any Algebraical expression may
be written down according to the following rule:—
“ Add to the sum of the squares of each term twice
the product of each term into all the terms that
follow.”
Thus {a - h + c~d ) 2 =d l + P + c 2 + d? - 2ab + 2ac
2ad 2be + 2bd 2cd.
Note.—The square of a negative quantity is positive.
Rule lll. — Since (a + b) 3 a’ + Sorb + Sab' 2 + b 3
and (a, - b) z =a? 3 a 2 b + Sab 2 - b 3,
we may deduce the following rule for forming the cube
of any binomial: —
“The cube of the first term ± three times the
square of the first multiplied by the second + three
times the first multiplied by the square of the second
± the cube of the second.”


Rule IV.—Resolution into factors.
Rule Y.—Difference of two squares.
(b) Their difference, the second factor.
Thus in the expression (a hf (c df
Square root of first term is (a —b)
Square root of second term is (c —d)
Their sum is (« b + c —d)
Their difference is {a —b c + d).
Therefore
Rule Vl.—Sum or difference of two cubes.
The cube of any expression may be written down by
this rule. Thus
{a + h + c) 3 = |(a + h) + c| 3 = {a + b) 3 + 8 {a + b)' z c
+ 8 {a + b)c 2 + c 3
(a +b-cf = | («• +b)- c y =(a + b) 3 -B{a + bfc
+ 3 {a + by c 3.
Each of the first three terms may now be expanded.
In these examples (a + h) is the first and c the second
term.
In resolving any complicated expression into factors,
it will often be found advantageous to arrange the terms
in descending or ascending powers of some symbol.
If any expression can be put in the form of the
difference of two squares, it can Teadily be resolved into
two factors.
(a) The sum of square roots of the terms will be the
first factor,
(a h) 2 {c cl) 2 =[a —h +c— d) [a —h— c - d ).
[a) Since a 3 +h 3 —{a+ b) ( or —ah + />*), we have
the following rule for resolving the sum of any two
cubes into factors:—


“ Take the cube root of each term. The sum of
the roots is the first factor; the sum of squares of
he roots less their product is the second factor.”
( b ) Since a 3 —b 3 =(a —h) ( a 2 +ab + b*), the difference
of any two cubes may be resolved into factors by
the following rule: —
“ Take the cube root of each term. The difference
of the roots is the first factor; the sum of the
squares of the roots phis their product is the second
factor.”
Example 1—
(®+yf + ( x ~ y) 3 ={ x +y+ x ~y){ ( x + y )*- («+ y){* -y)
+(x - 1/) 2 j- = 2 x{x* + 3?/ 2 ).
Example 2
{x + y) 3 ~{x - y) 3 ={x + y-x + y)\{x + y) 1
+{x+y){x- y) + (x -yY\= 2 y(yf + 3a?*)
Rule Yll. —Certain trinomial expressions may be readily
resolved into two factors. These expressions may
assume four forms:—
(1) rt 2 + hx + c |
(2) a 2 hx + c]
(3) a 2 + hx - c \
(4) a 2 ■— hx c j
If we can find two numbers which, when multiplied
together, give the third term, and when added together,
give the co-efficient of the second term, w r e can resolve
these expressions into factors:—
Thus, (1) a 2 + 9« + 20 ) =(a + 5) (a + 4).
(2) a 2 —9 a + 20 j —{a— 5) {a —4).
(3) d 2 + a— 20 ) —(a + 5) (a —4).
(4) a 2 - a—2o / =(a —5) (a + 4).


In the two first cases, since the last term is positive,
we know that the signs of the factors are like, i.e.,
both positive or both negative. In the first case, the
sign of the second term tells ns that both are positive
and in the second case that both are negative.
In the two last cases, the sign of the last term shows
us that the signs of the factors are unlike, i.e., one
positive and the other negative. The sign of the
second term is always the sign of the greater. Hence
in (3) the greater is positive, in (4) the greater is
negative.
Rule VIII.—The form x n ± y n .
1. If nbe even, x n + y n is divisible by neither x + y
nor x y.
2. If nbe even, x ll - y n is divisible by both x + y and
® - y-
8. If n be odd, x n + y ll is divisible by x + y but not by
® - y .
4. If n be odd, x n - y n is divisible hj x - y but not by
x + y.
The form of the quotients should be carefully remem-
bered.

Note I.— lf the sign of the Divisor and Dividend be botli negative, all the signs of
the quotient are positive. If the signs of the Divisor and Dividend be both
positive, or positive and negative, the signs of the quotient are positive and
negative alternately.
Note 2. —The powers of x decrease and the powers of y increase by one each tjrm


Rule IX.—lf the sum of the co-efficients of the terms in
any expression be zero, the expression contains a factor
of the form x- y.
In the expression x 3 + x 2 5x + B, the sum of the
co-efficients 1 + 1 5 + 8 is zero: this expression,
therefore, contains a factor of the form x— y. This
factor is x— 1. Therefore x 3 +x 2 —sx + 8 =
(x -1) (x 2 +2x —3).
Rule X.—lf in any expression the sum of the co-efficients
of the odd powers of x be equal to the sum of the
co-efficients of the even powers, then the expression
contains a factor of the form x+ y. In this case we
consider x° as even.
In the expression x 3 + 6x 2 + 11a; + 6, the sum of
the co-efficients of the odd powers of x is 1 + 11 = 12,
and the sum of the co-efficients of the even powers
is 6+ 6 = 12. Hence the expression contains a factor
of the form x+ y ; this factor is x+ 1. Therefore
x 3 + 6x 2 + 11a; + 6 (x + 1) (a; 2 + 5x + 6).
Rule Xl.—Highest common factor.
(<x) Any common factor of the given expressions may
be removed, and this multiplied by the highest
common factor of the remainders will be the highest
common factor of the given expressions.
(5) The given expressions or any remainder may be
multiplied or divided by any number which does
not involve a common factor.
(c) All the signs of any remainder may be changed.
Rule Xll.—The following formulas will be found useful:—
(a) a 3 + h ?J +c 3 3 ahc —{a+b + c) (a 2 + // 2 +c 2
ah ac he).
{!>) cfi —b 3 + c 3 + 3 abc —(a—b + c) (a 2 + b' 2 +c 2

( d ) a z 6 3 —c 3 Ba6c =(a—b —c) (a 2 +6 2 + c 2 +c 2
+ ah -r ac 6c).

it should be proved by substituting the value of the
unknown quantity in the equation.

We first multiply the units by 4. Four times six is
twenty-four, that is 2 tens and 4 units. We place the
units under the column of units and add the tens to
the column of tens. Four times four is sixteen, and
adding the 2 tens, we get eighteen, that is one hun-
dred and 8 tens; we place the 8 tens under the column
of tens and add the one hundred to the column of
hundreds. Four times five is twenty, and adding one
hundred we get twenty-one, that is 2 thousands and

column of hundreds and add the 2 thousand to the
column of thousands.

If we remove the decimal point, in a decimal fraction,
one place to the right, the value of the fraction is
increased ten times. Take the following example:—

We cannot take 6 units from 1 unit, we therefore add
1 ten or 10 units to the 1 unit,- making 11 units, and
we take the 6 units from the 11 units and set down
the remainder under the units column.
Since we increased the upper line by 10 units, we
must also increase the lower line by 1 ten, adding 1
ten to the 7 tens we get 8 tens. We cannot subtract
8 tens from 2 tens, we therefore add 10 tens, 10 tens
and 2 tens make 12 tens, we then subtract 8 tens from
the 12 tens and set down the remainder 4 tens under
the tens column.
As we increased the upper line by 10 tens we must
increase the lower by 10 tens or 1 hundred, 8 hundreds


and 1 hundred make 9 hundreds. We cannot subtract
9 hundreds from 3 hundreds, we therefore add 10
hundreds to the 8 hundreds making 18 hundreds.
9 hundreds from 13 hundreds leaves 4 hundreds. We
set the 4 hundreds under the column of hundreds.
As we increased the upper line by 10 hundreds, we
must increase the lower line by 1 thousand, changing
2 into 3. Subtracting 3 thousands from 4 thousands
we have 1 thousand left and we place this under the

Add 7 hundredths to the 6 hundredths which makes
13 hundredths or 1 tenth and 3 hundredths, place the
3 hundredths under the column of hundredths and add
the 1 tenth to the column of tenths; 8 tenths and 5
tenths makes 13 tenths or 1 unit and 3 tenths, place
the 3 tenths under the column of tenths and add the
1 unit to the column of units; 4 units and 8 units
make 12 units or 1 ten and 2 units, place the 2 units

1 thousandth make 11 thousandths; we subtract 4
thousandths from 11 thousandths which leaves 7
thousandths and we set this down under the column
of thousandths; since we increased the upper line by
10 thousandths we must add one hundredth to the
lower line. 5 hundredths and 1 hundredth makes 6

we cannot take 8 tenths from 5 tenths we therefore
add 10 tenths to the upper line. 10 tenths and 5 tenths
makes 15 tenths ; 8 tenths from 15 tenths leaves 7

we must increase the lower line by 1 unit, and proceed
