CONCISE HISTORY OE THE ACCLIMATISATION
OF THE SALMONIDÆ IN TASMANIAÆ.
BY P. S. SEAGER,
Secretary to the Fisheries Board of Tasmania.
The idea of acclimatising the English salmon (Salmo salar)
in Tasmanian waters was entertained by some of the colonists
at a very early period in our history. In the year 1841, as
recorded in Vol. 1, p. 281, of the “ Proceedings of the Royal
Society of Tasmania,” the late Captain Frederick Chalmers, of
Brighton, in Tasmania, applied to Dr. Mackenzie, of Kinillan-
by-Dingwall, Ross-shire, Scotland, for salmon fry to bring to
Tasmania. The fry were not supplied, but the correspondence
is interesting, and shows how little was then known of the
Subject when Dr. Mackenzie suggested that artificially
impregnated ova deposited in a basket of fine gravel and
plunged in a tank would require no more attention until it
was landed in Tasmania, where it could be put into a pail and
Carried to any stream and there deposited. Dr. Mackenzie’s
last letter to Captain Chalmers, of 12th July, 1841, says:—
“ Next year you can have some fry sent south to you in better
time if you like, or if you will give me the address of some
Careful confidential friend, I will send him south two baskets
containing impregnated roe, say in September, one basket to
be sunk in water in England to produce live fish for your next
year’s trip, and the other to be shipped to your address in
Australia, where it is probable you will receive it long before
the fry begins to chip the shell. All that will be necessary is
to direct your friend to keep the basket under water in some
fresh stream till the ship is ready to sail, when one can be
transferred to the ship’s tank.” Dr. Mackenzie had evidently
a very limited knowledge of the difficulties which had after-
wards to be overcome in the transport of salmon ova before
success was secured. There is no record that Captain Chalmers
proceeded further with his experiment.
In the year 1848 Mr. James L. Burnett, of the Tasmanian
Survey Department, when on leave of absence, visited the
Duke of Sutherland’s salmon fisheries in Inverness-shire, and
consulted the manager, Mr. Young, on the practicability of
introducing salmon and trout into Tasmania. Mr. Young
Suggested two methods —one to bring out the spawn, and the
other to bring out young fish, giving the preference to the
latter. In a letter to Mr. Burnett, of 23rd October, 1848, he
Says: —“It would be a grand undertaking, and perfectly


practicable if it could be accomplished during the time betweeii
extracting the eggs and their hatching ; but unless that could
be done, I fear the delicate state of the new-hatched fish could
not endure the fatigues of a long voyage.” Mr. Young’s plan
was to erect boxes or tanks about 18ft. long by 4ft. deep and
broad, in which salmon smolts were to be placed, and regularly
and slowly supplied with water from the sea, and fed with
salted liver, boiled, and coarse flour bread, broken up small.
A paper on Mr. Burnett’s visit to Mr. Young, written by
Captain C. E. Stanley, E.E., with the correspondence, was
tead before the Royal Society of Tasmania on 12th September,
1849, and is recorded in its proceedings, Vol. 1, p. 135. With
reference to Mr. Young, Mr. Morton Allport, in his “Brief
History of the Introduction of Salmon to Tasmania,” says :
“ Mr Young gave the preference to the latter method (young
fish), which is the more remarkable, as from the account of one
of his experiments it is clear that he had accidentally been
Upon the verge of discovering the very method which, after
many years, led to success. In the experiment alluded to Mr.
Young caused the fecundated ova packed in baskets of gravel
to be hung in a running stream at different distances from the
shore. During a severe frost one or two of the baskets nearest
the bank, and those which were in comparatively still water
were frozen hard on the surface, and Mr. Young supposed
that the vitality of the eggs was destroyed ; but he let them
remain, and discovered that the only effect of the reduced
temperature was to delay the hatching of the ova for several
days.”
The result of Mr, Burnett’s enquiries was, that the then
Lieut.-Governor of Tasmania, Sir William Denison, whose
name is associated with so many important undertakings in
the colony during the term of his governorship, and who had
already evinced the greatest interest in the salmon question,
wrote to the Secretary of State to allow of tanks constructed
for the purpose, and supplied with salmon fry or smolts taken
at the right season, being placed on board some of the convict
Vessels, and brought out under the immediate care and super-
vision of the surgeon-superintendent.
Some such efforts must already have been made, for on 13th
August, 1849, Sir William Denison, writing to Earl Grey on
the subject of the introduction of salmon, says:—“ Several
attempts have been made to bring out the spawn, but they
have all failedbut there is no record of such experiments.
A long correspondence between Sir W. Denison, the Home
authorities, and Mr. A. Young, appears in the “ Proceedings
of the Royal Society of Tasmania,” Yol. 2, p. 40, wherein the
employment of a welled fishing smack to convey adult salmon
and smolts to the colony was advocated, and it is closed by a


despatch from Earl Grey, in which he states that it was
impracticable to carry the fish in tanks on the deck of the
prison ships, “ while, on the other hand, the alternative of
using a welled smack for their couveya ce has, for the present
at least, been abandoned as being attended with too much
expense.”
In the year 1852, through the efforts of those interested in-
the subject, and at the instance of the Governor, Sir William
Denison, an attempt was made to introduce both salmon and'
trout by means of ova. This effort is the first of which any.
detailed record exists* A paper read before the Royal Society
of Tasmania (see its Yol. 2, p. 288) by Mr, J. L.
Burnett, describes the arrangements made, and gives details of
the voyage of the vessel selected —the Columbus. The ova
were shipped on the 81st January, 1852, and the plan adopted
is thus described by Mr. Burnett: —“ About 50,000 ova of
salmon and trout were placed in a large oval tub or vessel
with a false bottom, 4ft. 6in. by 3ft. 4in., Ift. Sin. deep,
double-sided, made of wood, cased in lead, and capable of
containing 60 gallons of water, besides the requisite quantity
of gravel. . . . The tub was slung just under and on one
side of the fore hatchway, with directions that every six hours
a fresh supply of six gallons of water should be added by
means of a funnel inserted in a tube entering below the false
bottom, the old or original quantity (or the greater portion of
it) being drawn off by a stop-cock placed for that purpose in
the upper part of the tub, and that the six gallons of water
were to be supplied six times a day as the vessel approached
the Equator, making 36 gallons in the 24 hour?, and to be
again reduced in the cooler latitudes to the original quantity
of 24 gallons per diem.”
Mr. Gottlieb Boccius, who was employed by the Home
Government, through the Land and Emigration
sioners, to procure the ova, fixed the 15th and 20th April as
the dates upon which the trout and salmon respectively would
hatch, but the hatching commenced on Ist March, in latitude
14° 30' north, longitude 26° west, and the fry were seen in,
the tub until the water became thick and putrid. On arrival
of the vessel at Hobart the tub was examined by Dr. Milligan,
the then Secretary of the Royal Society of Tasmania, and Mr.,
J. L. Burnett, and it is not surprising to read, “ without
finding any traces of either spawn or fish.”
Mr. Burnett in his paper gives his opinion as to the causes
of failure, and his suggestions as to future efforts, one of which,
was that the temperature of the water should be regulated by
means of ice. This is the first recorded suggestion for the.
regulation of temperature, the importance of which appears,'
previously to have been entirely overlooked.


The cost of this experiment is stated to have been about
.£3OO, and it appears from a despatch from the Duke of New-
castle to Sir W. Denison, dated 2nd June, 1853, which covered
a detailed account of the Columbus experiment by Mr. Boccius
(see proceedings Royal Society, Yol. ii., p. 437). that in-
structions were given to renew the experiment under the
same supervision.
Arrangements for this further experiment were made with
Mr. Boccius, who provided the necessary appliance, which
were placed on board the “Duke of Roxburgh.” The sailing
of the vessel was delayed, but owing to a severe frost having
set in when the ova was required, artificial spawning could not
be successfully completed. The attempt was therefore aban-
doned, and the spawn-tub landed from the vessel.
The interest of the Royal Society of Tasmania in the subject
still continued, and the matter w#s frequently referred __ to at
its meetings, at one of which, held on 11th August, Xbs2, the
Secretary read a letter from Mr. J. C. Bidwell, Commissioner
of Crown Lands in New South Wales, to Sir William Denison,
covering “ Notes on the Establishment of the Salmon and other
Fish in the Rivers of Tasmania and New Zealand” (see pro-
ceedings Royal Society Tasmania, Yol. ii., p. 326), in which he
thus writes upon the introduction of salmon; —
“ Now, to do this it would be necessary to bring and hatch,
the spawn, and I think that by packing spawn in ice there
would be no difficulty in preserving its vitality for a much
longer time than would be required. It is not probable that
the vitality of fish spawn would be destroyed even by freezing,
but by merely packing it in ice there would be no danger
actual freezing as the ice would always be in a melting state.
Mr. Bidwell, in writing, explains that he would have written
long before, but that he had suffered a long and severe illness,
and it is more than probable that his health failing prevented
his practical views being more prominently considered and
carried into effect. However much we may be indebted to
those who afterwards adopted, to a large extent, the same
method which Mr. Bidwell suggested, it is due to the latter
gentleman that the credit of first suggesting the packing of
spawn in ice should be prominently mentioned in any history
of the subject.
On 9th February, 1858, the then Colonial Secretary of Tas-
mania submitted certain questions to the Royal Society
“ relative to the introduction of salmon into Tasmania,” and
the payment of a Parliamentary reward of £SQO for such in-
troduction, and a committee, consisting of the Hon. E. S. P.
Bedford, M.L.C., J. W. Agnew, Esq., M.D., Morton Allport,
Esq., and Joseph Milligan, Esq., F.L.S., was appointed, whose
Import appears in the proceedings of the Society, Yol. iii., p. 283.


Tne idea of the introduction of living salmon was still promi-
nent, as the committee state in th£ first paragraph of their*
report “ that the mere introduction of spawn, even though
properly fecundated and in a state of vitality, ought not of
itself to entitle the person introducing it to any portion of the
reward.” Members of this committee lived to learn that the
most successful means of conveying salmon to distant parts is
by means of spawn, and that the introduction of living fish as
then strongly advocated at the time proved to be a failure. This
committee also advocated the use of ice to regulate temperature
during the voyage, and they recommended the construction of
breeding ponds, which recommendation was afterwards carried
out.
Sir Thomas Brady has, however, recently demonstrated the
possibility of carrying live salmon to the colonies by success-
fully conveying some fish, twelve months old, to the south of
the line, where their deaths were caused by improper food.
The next experiment was made in 1860 through the efforts
of a body of colonists then in England, known as the Austra-
lian Association —amongst whom was Mr. Edward Wilson,
President of the Victorian Acclimatisation Society,—working
under the guidance of Mr. James Arndel Toul, who from tnis
date was closely associated with every succeeding shipment of
ova from England to Australia and New Zealand, with, I
believe, one exception only, and who has displayed the most
praiseworthy zeal and self-denial in his efforts. It is said that
Mr. Youl’s attention was drawn to this work by the experi-
ment of Mr. Boccius, and that in the year 1854 he commenced
to study the artificial propagation of salmon and transport of
their ova. The association raised by subscription a sum of
£6OO, and the experiment made under their management cost
nearly that amount. The vessel selected for the experiment
was the S. Curling, which sailed from Liverpool for Melbourne
on 25th February, 1860, with 30,000 salmon ova, collected by
Mr. R. Ramsbottom, from the River Bovey, in Wales. The
shipment was under the care of Mr. Alexander Black. The
apparatus consisted of a supply tank on deck of 200 gallons
water, the water being conveyed from this tank by means of a
fin. pure block-tin pipe, which passed through the deck into
an ice-house containing, when the vessel sailed, 15 tons Wenham
Lake ice; the pipe was taken twice round this house, a length
of pipe of from 80 to 100 ft., when it found its exit into the
vessels for the ova, which comprised a stout framework 4ft.
square, surrounded on all sides by a continuous wooden trough,
Ift. wide, 6in. deep, lined with pure block tin, with stops at
intervals to divide and regulate the depth of water, the steps
acting as falls for the purpose of aeration, and a further fall of
Ift. from the upper series qf troughs to the lower was made to


aid in the same direction. The bottom* of this trough’ was*
covered with fine gravel, in -which the ova was placed. The
ova apparatus was swung, with chains and pulleys to keep it
steady and counteract the pitching and rolling of the vessel.
The water, after passing, through the ice tank, flowed over the
ova, fell into a tank below, from which it was pumped up
again to the tank above, thus maintaining, a regular stream :
1,800 gallons of spring water was shipped, with a supply of
charcoal for purification. The experiment failed, as on the
24th April, and the 59th day out, the last of the ice melted,
and the last ovum died.
In anticipation of the arrival of this shipment the Tasmanian*
G-overnment caused ponds to be constructed at North-West
Bay for the reception of the ova ; but these-ponds were never
used, and the site was afterwards abandoned in favour of the
present position at the River Plenty, where hatching-boxes-
and ponds, after the model of those at Stormontfield, in
England, were constructed, the sketches of Stormontfield
ponds having been supplied by Mr. Curzon Allport, then in
England, to his brother, Mr. Morton Allport,. Although this
experiment failed,, Tasmanians should always acknowledge
their gratitude to the subscribers to the fund and the Com-
mittee of the Australian Association, who bore the whole
expense of the shipment, and consigned it to-the Royal Society
of Tasmania as a gilt to the colony.
This effort is also memorable from the fact that Mr. Black’s
journal was submitted to Mr. (now Sir Thomas) Brady, of the
Irish Fisheries, for his opinion as to the causes of failure.
From this time up to the present date Mr, Brady has been
closely connected with each shipment to Tasmania. In the
year 1800 a joint committee of both Houses of the Tasmanian
Parliament, consisting of Mr. William Archer (chairman),
Messrs. Maclanachan, Henty, Chapman, Dr. Butler, Dr.
Officer,and the Colonial Treasurer, was appointed “to take
into consideration the report of Mr. Black on the introduction
of salmon into the rivers of Tasmania,” In their report, dated
31st August, 1860, they stated that “they deem themselves
justified in coming to the conclusion that our rivers and the
adjacent seas are adapted in point of temperature and in all
other respects to the habits and constitution of the salmon,”
and that they “ have good reasons for believing that it is quite
possible to introduce the salmon by means of their ova.”
Their estimated expense of the introduction was £2,400, and
they recommended that its conduct and the appointment of a
manager, etc., should be confided to the Australian Association
which had managed the previous experiment. The report
appears in Tas. Parliamentary Journals, 1800, No. 87.
Up to this date the mure active portion of the work in


Tasmania had been carried out by the Eoyal Society, but now
a wider interest was being felt in the subject, with stronger
hopes of success. The Government, on 21st October, 1861,
appointed a body of gentlemen as Honorary Commissioners in
Tasmania, and entrusted to them the management of the whole
subject.
The Commissioners at once entered heartily into their work.
Prior to their appointment, however, the Government of
Tasmania, acting in accordance with the re ommendation of
the Parliamentary Committee last referred to, had authorised
another experiment under the direction of the Committee of
the Australian Association in London, and the Commissioners
found upon enquiry that all such arrangements were completed.
The association in England derived great assistance from Mr.
Edward Wilson, of Melbourne, but the chief worker was Mr.
James A. Youl, who really directed all matters in connection
with the experiment. Mr, Youl’s great desire was that the
shipment should be direct to Hobart, and possibly to some
extent the giving effect to this desire contributed to the
failure which followed, as at the time he bad under offer a larger
vessel bound to Melbourne, in which the apparatus required
would possibly have worked more satisfactorily. After much
difficulty he secured a small iron steamer of 120 tons (the
Beautiful Star), at a cost of £5OO, which was, however, to sail
to the co'ony under a jury rig, and not to use her steam power.
The apparatus used consisted of trays, one set hung on gimbals,
and another large swinging tray, in each of which the ova was
laid on gravel, over which iced water flowed at the rate of 500
gallons per day. Mr. William EamSbottom, a son ot Mr. E.
Eamsbottom, of Clitheme, had been brought to England from
Melbourne and appointed to conduct the experiment. He
sailed in the Beautiful Star from London on 4th March, 1862,
with about 50,000 salmon ova. Pull particulars of the voyage
and its disasters appear in the report by Mr. Eamsbottom,
which discloses that the girabal apparatus proved a complete
failure from the outset, the ova dying in great numbers on the
first day at sea, caused by the violent rolling of the apparatus
keeping them continually in motion. The swinging apparatus
worked successfully, so far as the limited space in the vessel
would permit it to'do so. Ova hatched, and the fry survived
for a limited period only, owing principally to a succession of
severe gales, and finally to the failure of the ice supply, which
was exhausted at 1230 on 17th May, on which date the whole
of the remaining ova died at 1 p.m., with the exception of a
few taken from a small box in the ice-house, which lived for
eight hours beyond this time, 74 days after the date of sailing,
and 88 days from the time of the ova being taken from the
parent fish.


Notwithstanding this failure, the experience gained was
|hat reporting to the Chief Secretary the Commis-
sioners wrote “ they were justified in expressing a confident
opinion that that experiment, though unsuccessful, had demon-
strated the perfect practicability of the project, and the
certainty of success under proper conditions easily attainable.”
This shipment was the last failure and the cause of future
successes. The little box already mentioned containing ova
packed in layers in moss and charcoal, which had been placed
in the ice-house by Mr. Youl, and forgotten by Mr. Eatns-
bottom until he stumbled against it 60 days after the Beautiful
Star had left England, led to further experiments and the
institution of a similar system of packing ova adopted after-
wards in most of the future shipments. It is only natural to
suppose that there would be many claimants for the credit of
this discovery. The suggestion to retard the development of
ova by the use of ice was made long before by Mr. Bidwell, as
already mentioned, and there exist many records of somewhat
similar suggestions by other individuals at various times in
this colony and elsewhere prh r to the experiment in the
Beautiful Star. The credit of the first practical attempt to
test what had previously been many times suggested lies,
therefore, with Mr. Youl, who has stated that the idea was
first mentioned to him in Paris by M. Gurley, who showed
him how fish ova packed in wet moss in earthenware jairs
were sent long journeys. But prior to the shipment of ova
per Beautiful Star our present guest, Sir Thomas Brady,
then secretary to the Fisheries Board of Ireland, had by his
practical views on pisciculture attracted the attention of Mr.
Youl, and the latter gentleman several times visited Dublin
to consult with him, Mr. Brady was much impressed with
the packing of ova in moss, and writing to Mr. Youl on 24th
December, 1861, he says“ It strikes me that you ought to
try the ova in moss also. I got it up the other day in
beautiful order in moss, and it kept very good for several
days in the damp moss, and might keep so a very long time,
I think. I send you a sketch of what I would propose.” ("I
have this sketch, which shows a box of ova packed in layers
in moss, with a tank for iced water at top and a false
bottom, with tap to draw off the water after it passed
through the moss.] “If by means of the iced water
you can retard the hatching of the ova I think it will be the
easiest way of preventing them being tossed about by the
rolling of the ship as the moss will keep the ova steady. I
never saw any ova in such good condition as that I lately
received in the moss, and I am trying an experiment with it,
and also purpose sending some ova to Italy in this way ;
at any rate a small trial in this way would do no harm, and it


can easily be watched to ascertain if they are coming to life.
If they don’t hatch before the arrival it will he a decidedly 'safe
way of transporting them.” Mr. Youl sent the letter to
Tasmania with an endorsement: “ Requested Mr. B. to have
made for me an apparatus such as he describes to hold from
one to two hundred ova. I will feed them with ice-water
from the melted ice drawn from ice-house.”
This letter was written on 24th December, 1861, and the
Beautiful Star sailed on sth March, 1862, with a box packed
almost exactly as per Mr. Brady’s sketch, but without the water
tank. Mr Youl, writing some years afterwards, 26th March,
1867, thus refers to Mr. Brady’s value to him at the time.
“ So important did I think Mr. Brady’s instructions that I
paid three visits to Dublin to learn all I could on the subject,
and it was there I consolidated all I had read and previously
seen on the subject.” It affords me the greatest pleasure in
stating my belief that Sir Thomas Brady’s advice had much
to do with the experimental box placed in the Beautiful Star
and also to place on record the fact that, from the date of
his letter, thenceforward to the present time, Sir T. Brady
has worked zealously, heai’tily, and gratuitously with Mr.
Youl and others, in relation to all or nearly all the shipments
of ova to this colony, and that his interest in the acclimati-
sation of salmon in these Southern waters has never flagged,
but has now culminated in the most successful shipment of
salmon ova ever made. In recording this tribute to Sir
Thomas Brady let it be well understood that I do not in any
way ignore the self-denying work of our good friend, Mr, J.
A. Youl, C.M.G., whose value in this cause I so well know,
and whose work can never be forgotten by those acquainted
with the history of salmon acclimatisation in the Australian
colonies and New Zealand. I feel sure that should Mr. Youl
read this paper, he will be pleased to think that the services
of his coadjutor, Sir Thomas Brady,' are appreciated so well
by the colonists of Mr, Youl’s former home, who have so
many times admitted their indebtedness to himself in the
same direction.
The experience gained in the Beautiful Star experiment
was a matter of much consideration by the Commissioners
and Mr, Ramsbottom, who were equally anxious that the
method of packing ovain mossand ice should be practically and
thoroughly tested. The Commissioners forwarded a report to
His Excellency the Governor, T. Gore Browne, on Ist September,
1862 (Parliamentary Paper, No. 82, 1862), in which they
recommended the immediate return to England of Mr.
Ramsbottom to arrange another experiment, and “ during the
approaching winter Mr. R would be able —first to put to the
test| of further experiment the preservation of the ova


moss, of which his late experience in the Beautiful Star has
led him to think so favourable; and secondly, to ascertain
whether and for what period the ova can be preserved alive
in a state of congealation.” At the date of this report it was
considered that the latter method would be supplementary to
the main plan. At the same time Mr. Youl was also working
in a similar direction, as shown by a letter addressed by him
to a member of the Salmon Commission, dated 27th October,
1862, in which he writes : “ So impressed am I with the little
experiment in the box with moss that I mean to try an
experiment at my own expense this year, to test it by placing
some 20 small boxes, with from 300 to 600 ova in an ice-
house, containing 25 tons of Wenham Lake ice ; ” the experi-
ment was to be made, if possible, in a ship direct to Hobart.
Mr. Youl, was afterwards in treaty for space in the s.s. Great
Britain, but the expense involved being greater than he
anticipated, and being afraid of the effect of the vibration
of the, screw on the vitality of the ova, this shipment did
not take place, but he afterwards secured necessary space in
the Dunrobin Castle sailing for Hobart direct, had everything
arranged, and orders given for the construction of the ice-
house, when the owners, fearing injury to the cargo from the
melting ice, withdrew their promise and the shipment was
abandoned.
In the meantime with the use of the Wenham Lake Ice
Company’s vaults in London, and the assistance of Messrs. E.
Eamsbottom, W. Eamsbottom, Thos Johnston, and others, a
series of experiments were being carried out under the direction
of Mr. Youl with ova packed in moss in boxes similar
to the box placed in the ice-house of the Beautiful Star.
The boxes were covered with ice and examined at different
periods of 45, 57, 90, 120, and 144 days, with perfect success,
the vitality of the ova having been in no way impaired, and
ova of each lot being successfully hatched. Thus, at last,
the long cherished hope of the successful acclimatisation of
the salmon species in distant lands was in a fair way of
accomplishment, the expensive and somewhat cumbersome
mode hitherto adopted by means of trays with gravel, etc.,
was at once abandoned, and Mr. Youl, writing on 25th May,
1863, says; —“ It does, therefore, appear that the best way of
making another attempt next year would be with ova in. an
ice-house, and not to attempt it again by placing them in a
running stream, which not only entails a much greater
outlay, but is attended with so much risk.”
The Salmon Commissioners again entrusted the manage-
ment of a further experiment to the Australian Association
in England, who delegated to Mr. Youl “the sole superinten-
dence of the necessary preparation of the renewed experiment


■about to be tried."” Mr. You! found great difficulty in pro-
curing a suitable vessel, the desire of the Commissioners
being that the experiment should be made in a ship sailing
direct to Hobart. Although arrangements were nearly com-
pleted with the ownei-s of a barque named the Alfred Hawley,
circumstances arose which rendered this impossible, and Mr.
Youl, fearing the loss of another year, sought the aid and
assistance of Messrs. Money Wigram and Sons, who
generously allotted to him 50 tons of space in their well-
known clipper ship, the Norfolk, advertised to sail for Mel-
bourne on the 20th of January following. Messrs. Wigram
first intimated that the space was without charge, but Mr.
Youl offered them 100 guineas from his private purse,
which were subsequently declined, Messrs. Wigram being
■ desirous that the service should be entirely gratuitous. Mr.
Youl, having overcome one great obstacle, was almost im-
mediately met by another. He had engaged Mr. Robert
Ramsbottom, the well-known pisciculturist, of Clitheroe, to
forward a supply of salmon ova from the Ribble, for shipment
per the Norfolk, but every fish captured in the Ribble was
found to have shed its spawn. In this dilemma Mr. Youl
published in The Times an appeal for assistance, and des-
patched Mr. Ramsbottom with his son to the Dovey, in Wales,
and Mr. Johnston, another experienced pisciculturist, to the
Tyne, and their efforts were successful, about 100,000 salmon
ova reaching London on 18th January. The ova was at once
packed and shipped in the Norfolk: the mode of packing at
that time adopted has been repeated with little alteration in
each succeeding shipment, and is thus described by Mr.
Youl: —“ A couple of handfuls of charcoal are spread over
the bottom of the box, then a layer of broken ice; after this,
a bed or nest of wet moss is carefully made and well drenched
with water. The ova are then very gently poured from a
bottle, which is kept filled with water. The box is now filled
up with moss, and pure water poured upon it until it streams
out from all the holes. Another layer of finely pulverised
ice is spread all over the top of the moss; the lid is then
firmly screwed down. The boxes used measured llfin. long,
6fin. wide, and 6| in, deep, perforated top and bottom.
In addition to the salmon ova, a small consignment of
trout ova (Sahno fario ) was placed in the ice-house, con-
tributed by Admiral Keppel through Frank Buckland and by
Francis Francis. All the boxes were placed in the ice-house ;
the remaining space was filled with blocks of Wenham Lake
ice, and the house securely closed. The Norfolk sailed from
ithe London Docks on 21st January, 1864, arriving at
Melbourne on 19th April following. Before stating the
procedure on the vessel’s arrival at her destination it may be


well to here enter into rather full details in relation to this
shipment of ova, as the produce formed the first stock of
salmon and trout liberated in Australian waters. Many
theories are now advanced as to the various species to be
found in these waters, and doubts have frequently been
raised as. to whether true salmon ova were ever received;
opinions have also been expressed upon different
specimens of trout (8. fario), which have been called fario
eripx, etc. Under these circumstances I have thought it
well to record all available information in my possession,
which may help to set at rest unfounded theories and
incorrect assumptions upon so important a matter. The
salmon ova. were obtained from the following rivers in
England and Wales :
River Dovey, 17,000, obtained by R. Ramsbottom.
Rivers Rlbble and Hodder, 35,000 to 45,000, obtained by
Westell Ramsbottom.
River Severn, 30,000 to 40,000, obtained by W. Ramsbottom
and Allies.
River Tweed, 20,000, obtained by Johnston.
With regard to the salmon the names- of those who
collected the ova are well-known as men of experience who
were not likely to err in the choice of fish for stripping; that
the greatest Caution and care were exercised does not admit
of a doubt Mr. Youl has always indignantly repudiated the
suggestion that any mistake could possibly have been made
by sending for salmon ova that of another species. .»
I have a newspaper clipping which thus refers to Mr..
Ramsbottom’s proceedings at the River Dovey:—
“The Dovey Fisheries at Machynlleth.—Mr. Ramsbottom,
who has been so successful in the artificial propagation
of salmon, has lately visited the Dovey for the
purpose of obtaining salmon ova to send to Tasmania.
He commenced netting in Mr. Bulkeley’s water on the upper
part of the Dovey, but here only succeeded in getting two
fish suited to his purpose. These he put in a small piece of
water near the river at Mallwyd, secured by a cord to their
tails’; but, although he had paid the men very liberally, and-
explained throughout the neighbourhood the great object the
fish were to be used for and the enormous expense already
incurred, and that the ship that was to convey the ova was on
the eve of sailing, some scoundrels actually cut the cords and
stole the fish during the time of service on Sunday. He
subsequently, with the permission of the Preservation Society,
succeeded in getting from the lower part of the Dovey at
Derwenlas two splendid female salmon of 281 b. and 141 b..
weight, laden with spawn, from which he obtained all that


he required He Captured numbers of very large Salmon,
both in the upper part of the Dovey and at Derwenlas, but
all had spawned.” .
I have also a clipping from The Times of 18th January,
1864, with reference to the ova obtained from the Severn :
“ Salmon Spawn for Tasmania. —Mr. Youl, who has been
deputed by the Tasmanian Government to procure from the
English rivers a supply of salmon spawn for the purpose of
introducing that fish into his own country has, after many
difficulties, at last succeeded in obtaining a supply from the
Severn, which the Inspectors of Fisheries pronounce one of
the best salmon rivers in England. Last week he went down
to Worcester, and on Friday a number of fishermen were
employed, under the direction of the officers of the United
Association for the Protection of the Severn Fisheries, in
netting the river near Worcester. The result was that 18
salmon were taken, from which five were selected as being fit
for the purpose required. These were fish of from 151 b. to
181 b. each, three spawners and two milters j ust ready to shed
their spawn and milt. The fish were kept until Saturday,
when the spawn was pressed from them and the milt of the
male fish also shed over the spawn, which was deposited in a
vessel prepared for the purpose. When this was done —and
it was accomplished very successfully—the fish were returned
to the river apparently none the worse for the operation.
The spawn thus impregnated was to be conveyed to London
to-day, and will be at once despatched to its destination, a
vessel having been detained on its voyage for the purpose.
It is hoped that the experiment will be crowned with success.
Some interesting facts in connection with the salmon came
out in the conduct of this experiment. In a tributary of the
Severn —the liver Terne, which falls into the Severn near
Worcester —all the fish taken were found to be spent fish.
We believe that neither a new river fish nor an unspent fish
was taken. In the Severn out of 18 fish taken several were
spent, some were not sufficiently advanced in spawn for the
purpose of the experiment, and only two were fresh river fish.
The last-named fact at once affords ample proof of the good
policy of making January a close month, as it was done under
the last Salmon Fisheries Act. In order that the fishermen
might perfectly understand the object of the netting on
Friday last they were assembled and a local magistrate
explained to them that it was only legal to capture salmon for
the purpose of artificial breeding, and that even if fresh river
fish should be taken they must be returned to the water. The
fishing was witnessed by many.”
Can it be seriopsly suggested in the face of these extracts
that the ova obtained on these occasions was other than that


of 8. salar. The trout ova were obtained from the river
Itchin, from the Wey and High Wycombe, Bucks, The
former are thus described by Frank Buckland: “I have obtained
about 1,000 eggs, regular beauties, of 4 Itchin Trout; ’ ” and
the two latter are referred to by Francis Francis in a letter to
Mr. Youl“ The ova sent is the finest trout ova I ever saw,
and was taken from 81b. and 101 b. fish which had all but finished
spawning.” These trout ova were the first and only lot which
reached Tasmania alive, a second consignment in the Lincoln-
shire being all dead on arrival in Melbourne. From the
produce of the Norfolk trout ova the rivers of Tasmania and
the adjacent colonies have been stocked, and it will be at once
seen that, beyond the changes produced by food and water,
it is a popular error to suppose that many varieties of brown
trout are to be found in our rivers.
•The Norfolk arrived in Hobson’s Bay on 15th April, after
a voyage of 84 days. She was immediately boarded by Mr.
Edward Wilson, the president, and other members of the
Acclimatisation Society of Victoria, in whose presence the
ice-house was opened and an ova box examined, a consider-
able portion of the ova being found alive. Steps were at
■once taken to tranship the ova-boxes and ice to the Victorian
■sloop Victoria, which was placed at the disposal of the
Tasmanian Government for the purpose of conveying the ova
to Hobart; 170 boxes were distributed in 11 strong wooden
cases, each being covered with a quantity of ice and enveloped
in blankets ; 11 boxes of ova were retained by the Victorian
Acclimatisation Society for .the'purpose of being hatched in
Melbourne. Of these the first egg hatched on May, and
ultimately from 200 to 300 fry appeared, the temperature of
4he water having been kept at from 50° to 64® by means of
ice, and the fry were afterwards transferred to a tank, 120
being ultimately liberated in Badger Creek and never heard
of afterwards.
The Victoria sailed for Hobart on 18th April, arriving at
her destination on 20th April. The cases as packed in
Melbourne were at once transferred to a barge which was
towed by steamer to New Norfolk. Intense excitement existed
in the locality, and the greitest desire was evinced by the
residents to render assistance in transporting the boxes to the
ponds on the Plenty, The larger eases containing the ova
boxes, were slung on bamboos and placed on the shoulders of
men who thus carried them to the hatchery where Mr. Rams-
bottom, with the assistance of Mr. Morton Allport, at once
proceeded to unpack the ova and place them in the hatching
boxes, where they were deposited on the 91st day after
embarkation in the Norfolk. The temperature of the water
was reduced by means of the remaining ice to 42°, and


■averaged about 47° up to 12th May, from which date to 6th
July the average was about 41°. It was estimated that there
were about 36,€00 living ova, including trout ova. K)n the
4th May the first trout ova hatched, and on the following day
the first salmon; the hatching of the trout continued
until the 25th May, and of the salmon until Bth June;
the salmon fry were kept in the hatching boxes until
early in August, when they were permitted to pass
into the rill attached to a large salmon pond. The
trout were kept in the boxes until the end of August,
when owing to several deaths and the appearance of disease
amongst them, they were removed to a specially prepared
rill, when their number was found to be nearly 301. The
mortality amongst the fry was very trifling, and the fish
•continued to feed and thrive well in their new home. The
prospect so long hoped for of establishing the salmon in these
southern seas seemed about to be realised. 8o much has
been said and written of late years in relation to this experi-
ment, and so many misrepresentations and misstatements
made in reference thereto —frequently by those who should
have hesitated to make assertions without, due enquiry, and
assertions which could not be supported—that it seems
desirable to give in rather full detail the number of fish
liberated from the ponds, and the date of liberation.
A statement has been made that all the fish resulting from
the Norfolk shipment died before reaching the Derwent, out
this statement has arisen from the circumstance that on
4th October following the hatching, when the fry were about
five months old, a leak was discovered from the salmon pond
communicating with the River Plenty, through which it was
found that the fry were escaping, as one was captured in a
box placed at the outlet of the leak. A trench was at once
cut, and the leak repaired, which occupied 19 days, and
during that period 240 fry passed from the pond into the
leak, and were captured and returned to the pond. A very
large number must have already reached the Plenty, the
number escaping being estimated at 1,500. This estimate
was arrived at from the fact that upwards of 3,000 fry were
admitted to the pond from the breeding boxes, that the mor-
tality to the discovery of the leak was trifling, and that
owing to the careful watch kept night and day by Mr. Rams-
bottom and his assistants, the natural enemies in the shape
of water rats and platypi were destroyed. Mr. Ramsbottorn,
in his diary, referring to the water bursting upon them when
repairing the leak, which necessitated the immediate filling up
of the trench, writes:—“As to how many of our young fish
passed away with this terrible flow of water, I cannot give
the shadow of an idea, only that a vast number must have


found their way into the PleMy.” Owing to a rather heavy
mortality amongst the salmon parr in the pond, it was deter*
mined to liberate in the River Plenty those remaining.
The mortality could not he accounted for by Mr.
Ramsbottom, who said the fish affected, “ when dead,,
look as bright and as healthy as any I ever caught with the
fly and gentle in the Ribble; fine plump fish they are, and I
may say I never saw any so large for their age.” The water
in the Salmon Pond was lowered and from the 19th to 22nd
March, 1865, 419 young salmon, 10 months old, measuring
from 5 to 6 inches long were liberated in the Plenty, 14 parr
were retained being immature, and it was afterwards dis-
covered that others were unintentionally kept back, as On 30th
January, 1866, 38 smolts were taken from the pond and
liberated in the Plenty, and on 6th August, 1866, 76 smolts
were also liberated.
The result of the Norfolk shipment of salmon ova was
628 salmon counted into the Plenty and an estimated number
of at least 1,500 by the rush of water when the leak in the
pond was being repaired. In January, 1866, 38 trout were
liberated in the Plenty, and 133 were retained in the pond,
these fish formed the stock from which and their progeny, and
the rivers of this colony, Australia, and of New Zealand,
have been supplied. It is well to bear in mind, as already
stated, that these trout were the first and only importation
of S. fario into Tasmania, and that the very common opinion
that there are several species of brown trout in the colony
is thus manifestly inaccurate. Any variability existing must
arise from local causes connected water and food of
the rivers in which the fish are found.
The Salmon hawing strongly urged the
necessity for a further supply of salmon ova, the Government
provided the necessary funds, and the task of management
again fell to Mr. J. A. Youl who, through the aid of Messrs.
Ramshottom, sen., Westell Ramsbottom, P, Allies, and Thos. ‘
Johnson, procured the following lots of ova from the
rivers Ribble, Hodder, near Clitheroe, the Itchin, and its
tributaries, near Southampton, the Severn, and Teme, near '
Worcester, and the Tyne, and Tweed.
Mr. Ramsbottom, sen. ... ... 41,000
„ Westell, sen ... ... ... 16,000
„ Allies ... ... ... ... 500
„ Johnston ... ... ... 45,000
102,500
There were also obtained 15,000 ova of sea trout ( S .
trutta), and a box of trout ova, S. fario. The ova were packed
in 161 boxes, in the same manner as in the previous shipment


per Norfolk, and were shipped in an ice-house on board .the
ship Lincolnshire, which sailed from England on Bth February,
1866, arriving in Hobson’s Bay, 30th April, 1866, where the
boxes were transhipped to the Government steamer Victoria,
with the ice remaining, and sent to Hobart, which was reached
on 4th May, and on the following day the ova were all placed
in the hatching boxes at the Plenty, it being estimated that
50 per cent were alive. The hatching was complete on 80th
June, the first salmon ova having hatched on Bth May, 1866,
and the first sea trout on 12th May, 1866. In October, 1867,
it was determined to liberate the young salmon and sea trout
as they had assumed the small form, and they were permitted
to pass into the Plenty. In the Commissioners’ report, dated
2nd September, 1869, the numbers liberated are stated to have
been nearly 6,000 salmon and 900 salmon trout. A few pairs
of sea trout were detained as a breeding stock.
For many years subsequently to this date the work of
acclimatising trout and salmon trout was carried on at the
breeding ponds with great success as to trout, but with only
modified success as to salmon trout, which spawned for the
first time in Tasmania in fresh water, without having been
to the sea, in June, 1869, as after a few years it was found
that although the few salmon trout detained, and their
increase, continued to deposit ova, their fertility ceased and at
last the fish were liberated.
But in 1882, a Royal Commission having been appointed
to enquire into and report upon the fisheries of the coloqy,
it was recommended by that body that further importations
of salmon ova should be procured. Parliament acting upon
their recommendation provided the necessary funds, and the
Hon J. W. Agnew, a member of the Salmon Commission visit-
ing Europe in 1882, was entrusted by his brother Commis-
sioners with the uncontrolled direction of a further shipment of
salmon ova. Dr. Agnew, from various causes, was unable to
carry this object to completion, but he was able to correspond
with and to visit Mr. J. A. Youl and Mr. T. F. Brady, whose
co-operation he secured, and those gentlemen, with the assist-
ance of Mr. Richard Philpott, Merchant, of 3, Abchurch
Lane, London, were afterwards appointed a Committee of
Management to conduct the next shipment, the lattef'gentle-
man acting in finance and the two former in packing and
collecting the ova. Through the co-operation of RL. Moore,
Esq., Molennan, Londonderry, R. J. Mahony, Esq., Dromore
.Castle, County Kerry, and Samuel L. Alexander, Esq., Roe
Park, Limavady Londonderry, Mr. Brady was
enabled, with the assistance of his son Mr. Herbert Brady,
and Mr. Nevin, head-keeper to Mr. Moore, to secure upwards
of 80,000 ova, presented by these gentleinen through Mr,

Brady to the colony, which were conveyed to London and
there packed by Mr. Youl in the usual manner in moss, and
shipped in an ice tank in the s.s. Abington, sailing for
Hobart on 19th February, 1884; she arrived in the
Derwent Ist May, after a passage of 71 days; the ova
being deposited in the hatching boxes at the Plenty on the
following day. The following tables extracted from the
Salmon Commissioners’' report, dated 15th July, 1884
(Parliamentary paper, No, 68, Session 1884), furnish full
particulars relating to this shipment:
The hatching continued up to the Ist July, and on that
date there were in the boxes 1,825 fry. ■
The following return shows the mortality of ova and fry
from the date of the first count, sth May, to the end of the
hatching, Ist July.
The cause of comparative failure on this occasion was a
defect in the drainage of the ice-house which became choked
with debris, thus preventing the exit of the melted ice and
causing the ova boxes to float and knock about with the rolling
* Not including 3,000 sent to Launceston.

of the ship, and also saturating the-moss and decomposing it
and killing the ova. Prom this shipment, 229 smolts were
liberated in the River Plenty during 1885, and 730 in
October, 1886.
Thirty fish of the Abington shipment were retained in a
special pond at the Plenty hatchery, and although their
growth has not been very great they were artificially spawned
during last season, producing 3,140 ova, from which 300 fry
were liberated, the majority being forwarded to the Northern
side of the colony under the care of the Hon. James Smith,
M.L.C., whose attention to his charge was so great that he
succeeded in liberating 300 in the rivers selected, and 60
were also placed in the Plenty It is hoped that for a time,
at least, ova will be obtained from the stock detained which,
however, through deaths is now reduced to 9 fish..
Parliament having supplied a vote for another shipment,.
Messrs. Youl and Brady again offered their valuable services,
and Mr. Brady gave his personal attention to the fertilising
of the ova from carefully-selected fish from the rivers Erne
and Blackwater, Messrs. Mahony, Moore, and Alexander
having a 'second time generously granted the use of their
waters for the purpose and presented the ova to the colony.
The Salmon Commissioners had also made suggestions to
Mr. Youl as to improvements in the ice-house, profiting by
the experience of the defects on the previous occasion in the
Abington. Mr. Brady succeeded in securing about 160,000
ova, which were packed by himself and Mr. Youl in 101
boxes, and shipped in an improved ice-house in the s.s.
Yeoman, which sailed from London on 27th February, 1885,
arriving at Hobart on 4th May. On arrival the ice-house
was opened, and the result found to be highly satisfactory.
The ova were at once removed to the ponds at the Plenty,
and the hatching was completed in June with greater success
than had hitherto been obtained, and much of this success
may fairly be attributed to the improvements in the ice-
house. Ten thousand ova of this shipment were “ eyed ova,”
i.e., ova arrived at such a state of development as to have the
eyes visible in the ovum, and the unpacking of this lot
revealed so few dead eggs that in their report to Parliament
upon the shipment, the Commissioners wrote: —“This cir-
cumstance would seem to indicate that in future experi-
ments ova alone which have arrived at the ‘eyed’ stage
should be packed.”
Prior to the shipment per Yeoman, a small lot of about
10,000 ova had been shipped to Hobart per s.s. Tainui, in an
insulated case placed in a small room adjoining the refrigera-
ting machinery. The case had a series of six trays for ova,
with an ice tray above each, the ice being supplied from the


refrigerator during the voyage. The care of the room was
entrusted to a gentleman passenger travelling to Hobart, who
was fully instructed in-his duties, and faithfully performed
them. Although on arrival a large percentage of the ova
were alive, the result after hatching was very indifferent.
It is, however, impossible to assign accurately any satisfactory
reason for this result,’ which may have arisen from one of
several causes. When writing of this experiment to Sir
Thomas Brady, while advocating the old system of shipment
in ah ice tank, I admitted that the refrigerator boxes in the
hands of a skilled attendant would be a great success, and the
recent great success of Sir T. Brady’s shipment, per Kaikoura,
conducted upon a somewhat similar principle to that adopted
in the Tainui, but upon a larger scale and improved arrange-
ments, bears out what I then wrote. I am still, however,
inclined to support the old method of the ice tank, as pro-
viding an even temperature and requiring no supervision or
attention during the voyage, in preference to the insulated
cases, which really need the attention of a skilled attendant,
thereby adding considerably to the outlay. The fry from the
Yeoman and Tainui being so large in number could not be
conveniently detained in the ponds, and it was determined to
liberate them when the umbilical vesicle was absorbed, and
27,000 salmon fry were placed in various rivers of the colony
between 18th August and 2nd December following. For the
first time in the history of salmon acclimatisation in Tasmania
8. solar were liberated in other rivers than the Derwent, the
allotment being as follows :
River Derwent and tributaries ... ... ... 10,950
South Esk (71 died) ... ... ... ... ... 6,000
North Esk ' 250
River Huon (10 died). . ... ... ... ... 4,000
River Mersey (40 died) ... ... ... ... 4,000
River Pieman (all died) ... ... ... ... 500
River Leven (25 died)... .. ... ... ... 2,000
River Inglis (86 put in Inglis, about 25 put in South
Esk) 200
27,900
785 therefore died in transit.
This shipment was the last carried out under the direction
of the Salmon Commissioners, but before closing the record
of their work it should be stated that in addition to -8. solar ,
8. trutta, 8. fario , they have successfully introduced to the
waters of the colony the American brook trout, 8. fontinalis,
ova of which were obtained from New Zealand in 1883, the
ncreaae from which has been distributed amongst many


streams and lakes in Tasmania. The fish is a great acquisition,
being a handsome, plump fish, very game and taking the fly
readily ; it is in great demand, and justifies all that had been
reported of the species prior to its introduction at the.
instance of Mr. W. Tarleton, a member of the Commission,
whose attention was drawn to the fish in New Zealand when
visiting that colony.
The Commissioners tendered their resignation on 20th June,
1887, and closed a history of 26 years’ useful and valuable
work performed amidst many difficulties and discouragements.
They have often been assailed as incompetent, but when the
names of the more prominent are considered such charges
entirely fail. Who would have dared to have challenged
the scientific knowledge and attainments of the late Morton
Allport, who was so closely associated with the experiments
until success was attained, and whose memory still lives in the
records of his work amongst the papers of this Society.
Self-denying, an ardent lover of nature in every form, his
death created a blank which has not yet been supplied. I
speak thus feelingly of him, having had the privilege of his
friendship and a personal knowledge of the zeal he threw
into the work of salmon acclimatisation. He was also the
means of introducing other fishes, to the colony. Sir Robert
Officer, for many years Chairman of the Commission, was
also well known as a man of science and a zealous worker.
Mr, R. M. Johnston, F.L.S., etc., another member, needs no
eulogy from me. He is the author of the only complete
catalogue of Tasmanian fishes, and his general scientific
attainments are universally acknowledged. Mr. Matthew
Seal’s practical knowledge in fishery matters are also admitted
by all. The Hon. J. W. Agnew, last Chairman of the
Commission, and Hon. Secretary of this Society, and a
member of the committee which reported on the subject in
1858, is a worker of no mean order, and the other members
of the Commission at different times —the Hon. Captain
Langdon, Thos. Giblin, the Hon, Archer, W. A. B.
Jamieson, the Hon. Dr. Butler, R. 0. Read, John Swan, A.
G. Webster, A. Riddoch, W. Tarleton, H. Weedon, R. P.
Irvine, Bernard Shaw, J. H. Wedge, J. Buck land, and C. E.
Beddome, the Hon. W. A. B. Gellibrand—make up a roll to
whom Tasmanians should be glad to acknowledge their
indebtedness for years of self-imposed labour. If all the
success desired has not been attained, it is from no lack of
zeal or labour on their part.
I may be pardoned for having - thus referred to the mem-
bers of the late Commission, having worked with them as
their Secretary for many years, and I submit with confidence
that an impartial study of what they performed during


their tenure of office well entitled them to the com-
mendation they received from His Excellency the Governor
on their retirement, which was conveyed to them by the Chief
Secretary as follows : —“ His Excellency accepts with regret
the resignation of these gentlemen, and the members of the
Government desire to join with him in expressing the high
sense entertained of the valuable services rendered by the
Commissioners in their efforts to introduce the salmon into
the waters of Tasmania. The services thus voluntarily
rendered to the colony for so lengthened a period, during
which the Commissioners had to combat with difficulties and
discouragement of no ordinary character will, it is hoped,
result in the acclimatisation of the true salmon, as it has
already in the propagation and distribution of the salmon
trout.”
Thus ended the labours of the Salmon Commission, but the
work was not to stop there, as by a singular coincidence its
further prosecution has again fallen into the hands of this
Society, whose Ist volumes of records of 1841 contains corre-
spondence on the subject of salmon acclimatisation. Hr.
Agnew,' Hon. Secretary to the Society, the only surviving
member of the Committee who reported on the subject in
1858, was so much impressed by the success of the last ship-
ment of “ eved ova ” that he generously proposed to the Royal
Society of Tasmania, that if they would appoint a Committee to
undertake the conduct of another shipment, to consist of “ eyed
ova” only he would personally meet all the expense of the
undertaking. The Society willingly accepted so noble an offer
and appointed a Committee of Management, consisting of
Messrs. A. G. Webster, Matthew Seal, R. M. Johnston, C. T,
Belstead, R. C. Read, and A. Morton, to which committee I
had the privilege and honour of being elected'a member. It
was Hr. Agnew’s express wish that the whole management in
relation to the collection of ova was to be entrusted to Sir
Thomas F. Brady, who was invited to accompany the ship-
ment to the colony. His Excellency the Governor also lent
his willing aid to further the object. It is unnecessary for
me to do more than allude to the shipment per Kaikoura, as
our guest Sir Thomas Brady has, so recently at the opening
meeting of the session, given the fullest details of his work.
Those who, like myself, have been many years connected
with the Salmon Commission know well how to appreciate
the work Sir Thomas Brady has done for the colony on this
occasion. Those unacquainted with the subject know little
of the privations to be undergone in the collection of salmon
ova during the most inclement season of the year—the
many miles of travelling to be endured and the anxiety in
gelation to the numerous minute details necessary to ensure


success ; were such difficulties more widely known the great
value of such work would be more highly appreciated. Si
Thomas has received a hearty welcome and I trust he will
carry away with him from our colony the most pleasing
recollections of his visit, and live long to learn of the success
attending his recent labours and the establishment of a
valuable salmon industry in the colony.
Before closing this history I must draw attention to the
important fact that although large sums of money have been
expended by this colony in the work of salmon acclimatisa-
tion, great assistance w&s rendered at various times by other
members of the Australasian group. The following sums of
money having been contributed, <£995 by the,Government of
Victoria, <£2oo by the Acclimatisation Society of Victoria,
.£3OO by the Provincial Government of Canterbury, New
Zealand, £2OO by the Provincial Government of Southland,
New Zealand, and <£l6o by the Provincial Government of
Otago, New Zealand. The Victorian Government also on two
occasions generously gave the Use of their sloop Victoria to
convey ova from Hobson’s Bay to the Derwent.
I regret that I do not feel myself competent to enter
scientifically into the result in relation to the efforts made to
acclimatise salmonidse in Tasmanian waters, but in this
respect I am somewhat relieved by my friend, Mr. R. M.
Johnston, who has prepared an exhaustive paper dealing with
the matter from several standpoints. I can, however, claim
that success has been secured in the thorough and unques-
tioned establishment of salmon trout and brown trout, both
of which species are now abundant. The establishment of
the true salmon, however, is still to some extent a matter of
uncertainty. It must, however, be borne in mind that more
than one specimen submitted for scientific examination to
Dr. Gunther and others have been pronounced 8. salar, and
that Sir Thomas Brady has publicly stated his belief that
specimens shown to him are of the same species. In speaking
of them commercially, Sir Thomas states that such specimens
in a salmon producing country would be accepted as salmon
without a doubt. This= being so, I may almost claim that
the establishment of 8. sdlar is an accomplished fact, and
express my earnest hope that the grand result attending Sir
Thomas Brady’s shipment per Kaikoura will be the means
of so establishing the species as to admit of no doubt in the
future. The question of a change of character to some extent
in 8. salar by a new environment is so ably dealt with by
Mr. R. M. Johnston in his “ General and critical observations
on the fishes of Tasmania,” that I may be pardoned for con-
cluding my short history of the subject by quoting the
following extract from that work :


“ With respect to the exact nature of the Derwent migratory
“Salmnnoids, there has beeu much discussion as to whether
the 8. salar has really established itself or not. The
handsome fish which is now so numerous in the estuarv of
the Derwent is, within certain limits, a most variable form—
some individuals being almost identical in all specific
characters with the grilse form of 8. salar, while others
partake more of the character of the equally valuable 8.
trutta, and its still more closely allied congener, 8. cambricus.
It is clear to me, however, that the prevailing form found in
salt water is a mean between these, and it is this overlapping
of the closely agreeing characteristics of these so-called
species which renders it so puzzling to determine to which of
them any one individual belongs. The question, which has
excited much interest in Tasmania, is confused by the notions
of imperfectly informed persons, who, by the use of such a
misleading common name as ‘ bull trout,’ have led many to
think that we have Only succeeded in acclimatising the
common brown trout and its varieties in our waters, and
they often, in ignorance, speak of our fine migratory fish as
if it were a coarse, destructive fish of no value. It is to be
fegretted, where legislation may be concerned, that erroneous
notions should be circulated in this way. By such people
the fanciful views of amateur pisciculturists or sportsmen are
deemed to be of equal value to the utterances of learned
ichthyologists such as Dr. Gunther, whose profound know-
ledge forces them to speak with extreme caution.
“ We only know as yet that we have a fine non-migratory
trout (the brown trout), and a splendid sea-going migratory
salmonoid. The question is, not 8. fario versus 8. trutta, or
8. fario versus 8. salar, but the more difficult one of deter-
mining whether the variable, handsome, migratory fish, which
is frequently captured far out at sea, is (1) 8. trutta, (2) 8.
cambricus, (3) 8. brachypoma, (4) 8. salar, (5) all of these in
variable numbers, (6) a hybrid partaking in varying degrees
of the characters of the four named species, or (7) one or
other of those named but modified by transfer to a new
environment. If the individuals which prevail agreed with
or fell within the classified limits cf any one species we would
not have the slightest difficulty in determining their specific
value ; but when no one individual comes exactly within the
limits of the written characters, it is necessary that the seven
propositions advanced by me should be answered satisfactorily
before any one can pronounce with confidence on the subject.
“ Mr. Allport, who knew very well the niceties of distinction
between 8. salar and 8. trutta, inclined strongly to the opinion
that our Derwent salmonoids are grilse of the former, and
not 8. trutta. Dr. Gunther and Professor M’Coy have had


the disadvantage of determining the nature of the species
from single individuals sent to them at odd times. They
consequently, from such disconnected points, could have no
means of determining the curve of variability, and I am not
surprised therefore that, respectively, at different times, they
have pronounced certain individuals to be 8. salar, 8. trutta ,
8. camhricus, and a hybrid between 8. salar and S. trutta. Old
specimens cannot determine the curve of variability, nor can
they determine whether the four fish, so differently named,
were not after all the progeny of the same parents.”
Mr. Johnston’s observations are also supported by the Chief
Inspector of Fisheries of England, Mr. A. D. Berrington,
who in his report to the Board of Trade, dated 81st March,
1887, thus writes:—
“ The artificial propagation and acclimatisation of fish is one
of the hobbies of the day ; and the results which it is pro-
ducing are of great value. It has added much to our know-
ledge of the life history of fish, and consequently of the lines
on which their increase may be promoted. It has served to
show us more clearly how small are the differences which
separate the varieties of our salmonidse, and has furnished
proofs that in many instances these varieties are not of a
permanent character, but depend upon food and other cir-
cumstances of position. These are facts which must be borne
in mind if we would hope to avoid disappointment when intro-
ducing fresh strains into our rivers. According to all analogy
it must be advantageous to cross the existing breed, and in
so doing to bring in the best form of the race we desire to
Improve and multiply; but it must not be expected that the
special characteristics of the fish we turn out will necessarily
be perpetuated in the offspring, as under changed conditions
these peculiarities are apt to disappear.”
I trust, therefore, that with these opinions strengthened by
the views of Sir Thomas Brady, we will in the future hear of
fewer doubts upon the subject and accept the one broad fact
which is beyond dispute, that a fish has been acclimatised in
Tasmania which is of considerable commercial value, that it
is the means of attracting visitors to our shores, and that with
proper care and attention, it will in the future afford
profitable employment to our fishermen, and add wealtn to
our Island home.
