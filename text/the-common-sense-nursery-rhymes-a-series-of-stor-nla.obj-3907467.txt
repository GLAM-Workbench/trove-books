SNUFFLES AND SNIFFLES
Snuffles and sniffles are two little imps
That live in a little boy's nose.
Snuffles and sniffles go 'round with him
Wherever this little boy goes.
Snuffles and sniffles will hurry away
When his hankie this little boy shows.
Snuffles and sniffles will never stay
If a little boy blows his nose.


A NICE LITTLE GIRL
A soft little voice,
A sweet little smile,
A nice little girl
Has all the while
"I thank you," she says
For all that she gets.
And "Please" and "Excuse me"
She never forgets.


TABLE MANNERS
When I'm at the table
My dinner to eat,
I have to be careful
To keep myself neat.
My fork and my spoon
I will try to hold right,
And, when chewing my food,
I will close my lips tight.

WHEN MOTHER CALLS
Old mother hen scratching the ground,
Little fluffy chicks running around.
"Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck," says mother hen.
You ought to see the chicks run then.
For "Cluck, cluck, cluck," means "Come, come, come,
And that is why the chickens run.
Old mother cat sitting in the sun,
Little kitty cats having some fun.
"Purr, purr, meow," says old mother cat.
The kittens run when they hear that.
For "Purr, meow," means "Come to me,"
And that is why they run, you see.


Our mother dear working very hard,
Little boys and girls playing in the yard
"Come, children, come," says mother dear.
We children run when that we hear,
For mother's "Come" means "Right away,"
So at our play we must not stay.


MY NICE YARD
I have a nice yard,
And in it I stay,
And have a good time
At all kinds of play.
For outside the yard
There's no place to play
That's safe for a child,
Any time of the day.


TELLING THE TRUTH
Once, Ralph went on the street to play
When told he must not go,
And, when she asked him if he went,
He told his mother "No."
Then Mother took him on her lap
And cuddled him up tight,
And told him she was very sure
He'd want to do what's right.
And that it's very, very wrong
To tell what is not true;
That boys and girls should tell the truth,
No matter what they do.

MY DADDY'S CAR
My Daddy has a car;
He takes me for a ride;
I sit upon the seat,
Right close up by his side.
I never turn the wheel,
I never move the clutch;
And anything about the car,
I never even touch.
When I grow very big,
Then I can drive the car;
I'll take my Dad and Mother, too,
And we'll go very far.

IN OUR BATHROOM
My washcloth and my towel
Are hanging up, you'll see.
My Mother put them there
For no one else but me.
This washcloth and this towel
Are hung upon a rack,
And everytime I wash,
I always hang them back

THE THREE BATHS
When little birdies need a bath,
They make a sudden dash
Into some water in a pan,
And splash and splash and splash.
When little kittens need a bath
To make their fur all slick,
They just stick out their little tongues,
And lick and lick and lick.

When little children need a bath,
They jump into the tub,
And put some soap upon the cloth,
And scrub and scrub and scrub.

SAYING PLEASE
"Please, may I go?"
"Please, may I do?"
"Please, will you do this for me?"
"Please" is the word
That always is heard
When children talk nicely, you see.
"Please, may I talk?"
"Please, may I walk?"
"Please, may I go with you, too?"
This is the way
We hear children say
When trying their nicest to do.


BEFORE WE EAT
Before we eat we wash our hands,
And wash our faces, too.
To touch our food with dirty hands
Is what we must not do.
So scrub, scrub, scrub; and rub, rub, rub;
This is the way we do.
We scrub, scrub, scrub, and rub, rub, rub,
Our hands and faces, too.

MY LITTLE DOG
I have a little dog,
A roly-poly pup.
He jumps into my lap
And curls himself all up.
I never pinch his ears;
I never pull his tail;
And when it's time to eat,
I feed him without fail.
I love my little dog,
I think that he loves me,
For every place I am
Is where he wants to be.


WHEN WE ARE SICK
When little boys and girls are sick,
And have a naughty ache,
They must do just what mother says,
And medicine must take.
And if they have to lie in bed
All night and all the day,
They must not fret or toss about,
But very quiet stay.


GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD MORNING
When Jamie climbs into his bed,
He pulls the covers tight,
And shuts his eyes and goes to sleep,
When he has said, "Good night."
And in the morning when he wakes,
He jumps up with a smile,
And gets his clothes and puts them on,
A smiling all the while.


&L
BUMPETY BUMP
Bumpety, bumpety, bumpety bump;
When you fall down, get up with a jump,
Never begin like a baby to cry,
But say to yourself, "What a brave boy am I."
The horrid old bump is not going to stay,
The ugly old scratch will soon go away,
Then you will be glad that you didn't cry,
But said to yourself, "What a brave boy am I."


GOING TO BED
Three little children going to bed,
Good as they can be.
After a while, if you go to their room,
This is what you'll see:
Six little shoes all in a row
Underneath a chair,
One little dress, two little suits,
All hung up with care.

JOLLY ROUND SUN
Jolly round sun, away up so high,
Shining so brightly in the blue sky,
Goes off to sleep, away out of sight,
And then it is dark, and we call it the night.
Then it is time for girls and for boys
To come in from play and put up their toys,
And go fast asleep like jolly round sun,
And wake up when he does for a new day of fun


MORNING AND NIGHT
"Good morning, dear Mother,"
All children should say
When first they get up
At beginning of day.
"Good night" to dear Mother,
Should always be said
By all boys and girls
When going to bed.
