EXPLORATIONS
IN THE
NORTHERN TERRITORY
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
By David Lindsay, Esq. (read June 29th, 1887 J.
Mr President, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen?As
you look at this map of Central Australia, showing its immense
tract of millions of acres of hills and valleys, lowlands and uplands,
most of which is still in its primitive condition, occupied only by
its aboriginal inhabitants and its indigenous fauna and flora, it
needs no mind reader to interpret the uppermost thoughts of your
minds, or to anticipate the questions you would ask an exploier
who has examined it.
If you are a geographer with a knowledge of the history of early
Australian exploration, the first question on your lips will be?
what of the brave but unfortunate Leichardt ? Can you tell us how
and where he died, or is there the faintest hope that any of the
members of his party still survive ? .
Then you will ask about the aboriginal people, it any prehistoric
records exist; and you will want a description of the sinking
geographical features of the country. If moved by an enterprising
spirit for pioneer settlement, your questions will be?what of its
lands, its waters, its woods, its grasses ?
If a Minister of the Crown or a member of the Legislature?and
particularly if you are alive to your responsibilities-you will be
desirous of ascertaining before the session of your Parliament is
far advanced what should be done for the development of this
territory, and possibly you may not be above gleaning a few grains
of information, even from me! , .
Do you not want to know of its stock-carrying capabilities, ot
its fitness for cultivation, of its mineral deposits, and if you will be
justified in connecting it by railway with the world?s ocean high-
ways in the North and South.
The very brief and very plain unvarnished tale which 1 have to
unfold to-night will, 1 hope, help you in some measure to satisfy
yourselves on these points.
You may not all know that my last expedition was a private
one, fitted out at my own expense, and that all the possible risk
and loss so often attendant upon exploration would fall on me.
Some public interest was attached to my work, as the South Aus-


tralian branch of the Royal Geographical Society and the Govern-
ment had decided to bear the estimated expenses consequent upon
my having offered to take a botanical collector.
Sir Thos. Elder, in that generous spirit towards explorers which
always characterizes him, came forward with the offer of two
camels for the use of the collector; thus, I was enabled to accept
the services of a gentleman, Lieutenant Dittrich, who had volun-
teered to accompany me. His attachment to the party proved to
be a serious mistake, because he had no knowledge of the duties
he had undertaken, and lacked that enthusiasm which is so necessary
for the successful pursuit of any scientific object. His collection
of plants was poor and badly preserved, and the photographs of
natives and interesting natural scenery which he had taken right
across Australia proved, on being developed in Adelaide, to be
quite worthless, the majority of the plates being blanks.
Before crossing the 26th parallel into the Northern Territory, I
spent some weeks in tracing the course of the Finke river to its
debouchement, as a great deal of interest in the question had been
excited by the fact that the natives of the Macumba had pointed
to the north-eastward as the locality of what was supposed to be a
very large water, called by them ? Tirreawah.?
Following down the Finke from a waterhole named Muckarinna,
we traversed a well-grassed valley several miles wide, which is
subject to inundation. This is clearly shown by the dense growth
of box, gum, and other trees, and also herbs and fodder bushes
growing to a height of sft. to 10ft.
This valley in ordinary seasons may be considered the end of
the Finke, as in a few miles the sandhills closed right in ; but in
irregular seasons, when the floods are unusually high, the Avater
floAvs on doAvn the holloAvs between the sandhills for about ten
miles. Here and there a solitary boxtree Avas undoubted evidence
that the water did pass through these holloAvs, when it emerges in
tAvo places, distant one from the other about six miles, on to a very
good Avell-grassed plain.
Here Spring Creek, Avhich drains the high lands surrounding
Dalhousie Springs, thirty miles distant, contributes its waters,
Avhich, again entering the sandhills, splits up into many boxtree
Avatercourses, to again, in about ttventy-five miles, after forming
some fine waterholes, flood out on to splendid plains, clothed Avith
grasses, saltbush, and other good stock bushes. These plains lead
south-easterly, and it soon became eAndent to us that the Macumba
flood AA r aters came up this far, and, after inundating some 200 square
miles, floAv on to Lake Eyre.
But Avhat of the large Tirreawah lake that the had led
so many to expect on the Finke, and on Avhich it Avas supposed by
some that Leichardt and his party met their fate ?
Lake there certainly Avas none, and, after careful inquiry of
the natives, I came to the conclusion that TirreaAvah is an obso-


lete word, the precise meaning of which has been lost, but probably
meant a very great distance. So that, when the natives told Mr.
Jarvis, as publicly reported some time ago, that a party of white
men had been killed long time ago on ? Tirreawah,? I think they
were only repeating something they had heard from distant tribes.
The natives have recognised tribal messengers, who barter their
respective commodities, such as pitchuri, weapons, red and white
ochre, &.C., and who convey many items of information.
I may say here that, to my great disappointment, I failed
throughout my trip to discover a single link in the chain of
mystery which surrounds the fate of the justly-honored Leichardt;
but the natives on the Macumba, pointing north-easterly, said
? white men killed on Tirreawah.? A native from the country east
of Alice Springs says that the natives farther on tell of white men
dying a long time ago, and I was told that a native woman on
Idumea Station, pointing westward, said ? that whites died that
? way long ago.? Now these three directions cut, and in that
locality something may be found, although Mr. A. C. Gregory, the
well-known Queensland explorer, is quite confident that the camp
found by him on the Elsey Creek was Leichardt?s. If this be so,
then, if any traces are ever found, it will be in our north-west
country.
It cannot be possible that any of the party are still living, and,
as years roll on, the less chance will there be of ever finding any
traces of that lost explorer.
We returned to Dalhousie, and a week later two of us, guided by
a black boy, set out for a water called Murraburt, which had been
much talked of for a year or two, and which was supposed to be
ninety miles distant Starting from Etelkertinna, a native well,
which on my previous journey I had discovered in the Finke, we,
directed by our native boy Paddy, travelled easterly for sixty miles
over a perfect sea of sandhills, which all lay at very regular dis-
tances apart, with a north-north-west and south-south-easterly
direction, very sparsely clothed with a few mulga and other bushes,
but a good deal of spinifex. Many of these hills were 70ft. high.
All slope up on the south-western side, and are very steep, nearly
perpendicular on the eastern side, and as the foot of one touches
the foot of the next, the travelling, with the sun at 114� to 125� in
the shade, was both wearisome and difficult.
Our guide once was in doubt about the direction, and on being
asked said, ?Me been lose him ; you straight walk.? On we went
for a few miles, when Paddy?s joyous voice was heard crying out,
?All right; me been find him. Long time me been sleep long
?this one bush long my mother when me picaninny.? Looking
carefully at this bush and the surroundings we were forced to admit
that, to us, there was no difference to any one of the many bushes
we had passed; but he was right, for he changed his direction
slightly and led on with the greatest confidence.


Just before dark on tbe second day we ascended a big sandhill,
and there beneath us lay a plain some two or three miles wide,
stretching away on either hand as far as we could see, looking
beautiful as the rays of the setting sun shone on the different
colored foliage of the bluebush, cotton bush, saltbush, and acacias
which clothed this plain.
Just at our feet, too, was ? Murraburt,? indeed a disappoint-
ment, for it was but a native well, difficult to get at, the hole being
perpendicular 12ft. and then a drive of Bft., so small that I had to
undress before Icc uld enter. The water was bubbling slowly up,
and slightly brackish. I believe it to be a spring, and that a large
supply of water could be obtained. There was no special object to
guide a white man, not a bush big enough to cut one?s initials on.
Our guide led us to eight other native wells, over sandhills and
many fine plains. All these wells had good water, and some,
apparently, a large supply. Of course it is impossible to judge of
the supply in a blackfellow?s well, for so long as there is enough
water for them to put their mouth to they are content. This is an
excellent sheep country, so far as the vegetation is concerned. To
the south of us we saw salt lakes glittering in the sunlight.
Shortly after leaving Murraburt we met with the cork tree, which
became more frequent for the next forty miles. It is the largest
tree in this country, growing 12ft. high, with a diameter of 9in.
Then it disappeared and was replaced with a few wattle trees or
bushes and the broad leaved gidyea and mulga, which cover con-
siderable areas stretching away many miles south and north.
Numerous natives live in this region, as shown by the number of
mia-mias at the wells. One mia-mia was seen large enough to
accommodate thirty or forty natives. At Kilpetha, a few miles
before w r e enter Queensland, there were forty natives, speaking a
different language to the Macumbo and Finke tribe. Greatly
astonished at seeing us coming from the w'est, they were much
afraid of us at first. However, on finding that we were budgaree
whitefellows, they were very communicative, and as inquisitive, as
is usual with the natives.
Time will only permit a few general remarks about the natives.
From the Macumba across the Finke through the MacDonnell
Ranges and on the Marshall, the language, manners, customs, and
tribal division are the same or nearly so.
Four classes or divisions regulate the intersexual relations.
These classes are Piltara, Gomorra, Panunga, and Parola. A Piltara
man can only marry a Gomorra, a Panunga man can only marry a
Parola. Bigamy, and in some cases, polygamy is practised.
Physically the natives are small but well built.
The corroborees are interesting studies?some are cruel and
painful, while others are very vile and calculated to arouse the baser
passions. As in other parts of Australia the great remedy practised
by the Ungelara or Doctor is sucking, whereby he pretends to pro-


duce from the bad eyes or rheumatic leg a hit of stone, charcoal,
or other hard substance, when the patient is expected to recover.
If the sick one does not recover then some enemy has burnt a bone,
and he must die unless he manages to kill his enemy.
Almost every living thing is eaten. The seeds of various
grasses and plants and trees are collected and ground into powder,
out of which a kind of bread is made. Box trees, acacias, munyeroo,
and nardoo yield large quantities of seed. Heaps of dry grass
which have been threshed for the seed are often seen in the Finke.
Roots, fruit, and berries are eaten. When the rats are numerous,
as they were last year, the natives become very fat.
We went fifty-five miles into the sandy desert, over sandhdls
and spinifex with no camel feed, but were compelled to return
owing to one camel knocking up, whilst another one was also
showing much fatigue.
We returned to the Finke and followed it up for eight days,
through a very good pastoral country, splendid grasses, herbs, and
bushes, and fine timber, water in claypans and native wells. At
times the vegetation was over our heads as we sat upon the camels
backs. The air was alive with the music of many birds, magpies,
parrots of various sorts, pigeons, doves, diamond sparrows, and
many others. ?
Near a waterhole, where we filled our water vessels for another
journey across unknown country, stood a high hill, from the top of
which we obtained, with the aid of powerful glasses, a very fine view
of that wonderful natural monument, Chambers? Pillar, first dis-
covered in 1860 by John McDouall Stuart, whose very name stirs
the hearts of South Australians, and the record of whose bravery,
determination, and hardship must thrill the reader with admiration
for the boundless energy which carried our ? Premier explorer ? and
his gallant band of followers right across our continent in ?6O and ?6l,
in the face of such difficulties and dangers that none but those Avho
have made long journey T s Avith horses in dry countries can imagine
or understand. Under what different conditions the exploiei of
the present day Camels, that in the hottest Aveather and
under the greatest difficulties can be relied upon to travel at least
eight days Avithout Avater, are substituted for horses. We have the
telegraph line across the centre of Australia, on Stuart s track to
fall back upon, and settlements on the north coast.
Thirty miles of the journey from the Finke to the LoAver Todd
Avas over low irregular sandhills, clothed Avith spinifex, desert oak,
parrakeelya, and loav bushes, Avith an occasional low stony hill; avc
then entered a very fine pastoral country, mulga and good grasses,
high bold hills and ranges ; passing through these we emerged upon
some flooded box country, Avith a Avaterless creek crossing our course.
Some isolated hills stood 350 feet above the plain ; from the top of
one I had an extensiA r e \ 7 ieAV over broken ranges to the north and
Avest, and to the east and south sandhills and affeA r table-topped


hills showing faintly on the eastern horizon some forty or fifty
miles distant.
An accommodating gap through a very precipitous range, whose
summit towered by aneroid measurement 700 ft. above us, afforded
an easy passage into a mulga-covered and well-grassed plain,
with a very high range to the north. All these ranges run east
and west; on the face of one eleven distinct walls of perpendicular
rock rendered the ascent difficult, if not impossible, the height
being I,looft.
Where we struck the Todd it was a large dry sandy channel,
with fine gum trees in it and on its banks. This creek loses itself
in the sandhills as in my journey easterly from Dalhousie after
crossing the Finke, for a distance, as the crow flies, of 130 or 140
miles, there is not even a watercourse of the smallest size, show-
ing that the Todd river waters are simply absorbed by the great
sandy waste lying to the south-east.
We were travelling in terribly hot weather, the thermometer
reaching 110� to 120� in the shade; and on the sixth day some of
our camels were getting sluggish, notably the two that had com-
pelled us to return on our former attempt.
We formed a depot of our goods and went up the Todd, and then
the Giles, hoping to find water. We travelled all night with Joorak
suffering from sunstroke, and camped at daylight. The creek was
horribly dry, with no signs of water, as I rode away to look for
water after having made a signal smoke on top of a hill to attract
any natives who might be in the vicinity,
I followed up the valley for three miles when a very dry stony
creek came in from the left, certainly not an attractive looking
creek for water, but that consciousness which so often at times of
our sorest need seems to compel us to do the right thing or go the
right way, guided my steps over these loose stones and boulders,
through a gap in the range bordering the valley, and immediately I
came upon a pad with fresh tracks of dingoes, emus, and kangaroos,
which soon led me to a clayhole in which was a little yellowish
water.
Some natives came in that evening, having been attracted by my
smoke, and after a few days led us to a fine spring in a gorge
beneath a frowning mountain 700 ft. high. From the top of this
rocky mountain, which was so precipitous that I could have
thrown a stone right across to the hill under which our camp was
pitched, an extensive view was obtained over a rocky, broken,
mountainous country. About 300 ft. up the face of this
mountain is a large rock archway about 40ft. high. Many fantas-
tically shaped rocks and caves are met with in these sandstone
ranges.
Journeying onwards we passed through sandstone, quartz, lime-
stone, gneiss, and granite, with some good rock waterholes. Fine
shady gum trees, good bushes of many varieties, grasses, and


saltbush showed this to be a very fair pastoral country. Animal and
bird life was very scarce. A few grey kangaroos and euro hopping
up the hills, and an occasional dingo and emu, were all we saw.
This country is, by aneroid measurement, about 3,000 ft. above sea
level.
After three days travelling we found a large gum creek coming
from the westward; it is evidently the Hale River of Mr. Winnecke,
and is another of those sandy rivers peculiar to Central Australia.
We followed this creek easterly for eight miles through a very good
pastoral country, when it junctioned with a larger creek coming
from the north-west, and which I named ? The Elder,? in honor of
Sir Thos. Elder, G.C.M.G, &c., &c., whose very great interest in
exploration has often been shown by the assistance he has gi\ en to
various explorers. Still travelling eastward we found watei in the
sand in a few places, and tin in a granite hill, also a bar of granite
completely studded with garnets crossing the creek. Just above
this point, when scratching for water under a rocky cliff, I found a
quantity of beautiful gem sand, containing many garnets and some
red stones of great brilliancy, which, after careful examination, I
believe to be rubies ; calling the attention of the members of my
party to this discovery, which may prove of great importance to
Central Australia, we passed on to find a large deposit of these
beautiful stones at the entrance to and in a wild and romantic gorge,
which I named ? Glen Annie,? after my wife. This glen, which is
five miles through in a southerly direction, and in parts only one
chain wide, with perpendicular cliffs towering up 300 to 500 feet
high, is impassable for loaded camels. In it there are some per-
manent waterholes and springs. From the top of a high hill I
could trace with my glasses a dark-green line of gum trees, marking
the course of a creek nearly due east for thirty or forty miles,
having a fine rugged range on its south side, and winding through
apparently a very good country. Ihis creek will also add its
water to the sandy desert, or- it may, after joining another large
creek met with later on, lead into the Hay.
The course of the Elder could not be traced, but natives told me
that its course is southerly, cutting through all the ranges until it
joins the Todd. The main rock is sandstone, but it has dykes of
limestone running through it with an occasional outcrop of iron-
stone. Mount Coghlan, named after the late Rev. F. Coghlan, a
conical peak guarding the entrance to Glen Annie, is capped
with ironstone.
We had now to face a terribly rough bit of country. A jumbled
mass of rocky hills Avith the watercourses full of boulders and tea
trees, much of the country being covered with mulga. At one
point I was Avithin half a mile of a plain, and had to return on my
track for some miles. The promised land ?plains stretching
aAvay in the direction I wished to travel, lay some 400 ft. beneath me.
By leading my camel, Avith great difficulty I descended to the plain,


and going across some three miles to a bold, black-looking, garnet-
studded granite range 700 ft. high, found a gum creek, which formed
a passable route for the caravan. Palms and bread fruit ?were found
in this range; passing on we found a very fine pastoral country.
Granite hills studded a good valley through which wound many
gum creeks, whose green vegetation held out the promise of water
at shallow depths. Then entering a rough but interesting country,
bold, broken granite ranges, with numerous peaks and fantastic-
shaped tops, good grasses and bushes in abundance. Some of the
hills are clad with palms, some with pines and gum trees, whilst
others are but a mass of rock destitute of any vegetation.
Quartz was met with, and as we neared the northern and eastern
extremity of the range, the hills became very rough, composed of
gneiss, quartzite, and sandstone.
On reaching the Plenty Wells, to which we had turned for water,
we were much disappointed to find that there w'as no water to be
had anywhere about, the whole country appearing to be suffering
from a drought.
Our camels not having had a drink for a week, and being doubt-
ful from the state of the country as to the existence of water at a
spot now some eighty-four miles distant, marked on the map as
permanent water, I decided to leave our goods in charge of two
men and go back into the ranges in search of water.
As we were travelling back towards the range I was again im-
pelled, by that unnamed consciousness previously mentioned, to go
to a rock some three miles off our course, where I found a fine look-
ing rockhole, unfortunately quite full of sand and stones. With
my hands I scooped out about two feet deep, when, just as my
finger nails broke on the rock, a little water showed. Firing two
shots?our usual signal?the party came across, and we immediately
began clearing out the hole, filling up our water vessels and watering
the camels, until, at 10 p.m., having worked eight hours, we had
removed ten tons of earth and stone and taken out 250 gallons of
water, which was just the quantity required. We left no water in
the bole.
Going east for eighty-four miles along a great sandy river, the
Marshall, to a small waterhole, over for the most part a very good
pastoral country, which stretched away for a considerable distance
north and south. In parts the country was most beautiful, having
shady trees scattered about and producing splendid grasses. The
sandy country clothed with mallee and poor scrub came in
occasionally.
At this hole we found thirty-six natives, who were timid and
spoke no English.
Every mile as we travelled north-easterly seemed to improve,
until surrounding the Tarlton Range, which is composed of low
stony hills beautifully grassed, we found a really excellent pastoral
country with the Mitchell and other good grasses. No permanent


waters exist, but some distance to the north water can be had in
large quantities by sinking only sft. This water, I believe, is the
underground channel of one of those great sandy rivers which
drains a great area of the MacDonnell Ranges. From here to Lake
Nash we passed over a splendid pastoral country, parts of it really
magnificent, undulating and clothed with luxuriant grasses, herbs,
creepers, and bushes, acacias, box, and other trees ; limestone and
a coarse yellow sandstone, with a few small waterholes, but many
places eminently adapted for conserving water. Leaving a native
well at which a number of natives were camped, we passed through
low hills clothed with mulga and gidyea, the broken flint-strewn
surface causing considerable inconvenience and suffering to our
camels. We then entered upon the extensive Mitchell grass plains
and downs which, relieved by an occasional clump of gidyea,
stretched away as far as the eye could see, and continuing with us
until a broken crystalline limestone country bordering the valley
of the Herbert was crossed, and we found ourselves on that river
about nine miles from Lake Nash station, having safely accom-
plished our explorations. The only misfortune we had to record
was the accidental death of one of the riding camels.
The aborigines had given us no trouble ?indeed there seemed to
be but few in the country, we having seen only about 100, although
old camps on all the large creeks were very numerous. Men and
women seemed to be in about equal proportions, and a fail number
of children were seen.
No drawings on the rocks were found, although they are known
to be in many places.
There are no great forests, but its hundreds of creeks have very
fine gum trees, and many varieties of eucalypti and pines are
scattered over the country.
Only in the ranges do we find permanent surface supplies ot
water, but much of the country having a very fair rainfall can be
made available by conserving water in dams and reservoirs. And
no doubt large underground supplies exist which will be tapped by
wells and the boring rod or diamond drill.
Its grasses are good, the chief being barley, silver, kangaioo, and
Mitchell.
Kangaroos, many varieties of rats, bandicoots, emus, dingoes,
quail, pigeons, cockatoos, and parrots, were more or less plentiful
in parts.
I found tin, silver, and copper. Gold will certainly be also
found. ...
The whole of the country passed over from the Finke is capable
of carrying stock.
The country between Lake Nash and Powell?s Creek, on which
we spent six months, is an elevated tableland, bordered on the
south by a sandy country, and on the north reaching up to the
coast range, on which cattle and sheep stations are being foimed,


it is watered by many creeks and rivers and embraces an area of
about 25,000 square miles of magnificent downs and plains well
and densely clothed with Mitchell, Flinders (red), and other well-
known grasses, besides bluebush and many other good stock
bushes, and it has an average annual rainfall of about eighteen or
twenty inches, I am inclined to the belief that this is destined to
become ere many years have elapsed one of the finest wool pro-
ducing districts in Australia.
The conserving of water by dams and reservoirs from the nature
of the soil and the contour of the country will be easy and com-
paratively inexpensive. Good water will also be obtained by
sinking over the whole tablelapd.
There is an important division of the waters just within our
boundaries. The Herbert river whose waters flow south to the
Diamentina. The Playford and Buchanan flows westerly, and are
met by many other creeks which all lose their waters on vast
polygonum and bluebush flats east of the Ashburton Ranges, where
there is a large basin having a considerable drainage into it from
all sides, and it appears to me at least probable that this water
will be found to burst out in springs in the unexplored country west
of the telegraph line.
Limestone is cropping up over these downs, sandstone, and a
little ironstone are met with, gypsum also. Timber is rather
scarce though sufficient for all station purposes, being limited to
the water courses and patches of forest country, which by some
explorers have very erroneously been styled desert country.
The natives over this country seem to be divided into about six
tribes, speaking different dialects, though their manners, customs,
and superstitions appear the same.
The Warramunga tribe, of which Cubadgee is a member, whose
country lies between Tennant?s Creek and Powell?s Creek, and a con-
siderable distance east and west of the line, seems to have ten families
or divisions regulating the intersexual relations. One man is chief of
the tribe, at whose death the position devolves on the eldest son,
unless he be not of age, when the brother of the deceased chief
acts as regent.
The Umbia tribe about Cresswell Creek have twelve divisions.
The Bing Binga tribe on the McArthur river have the same, and
the names of these divisions are the same.
The tableland and coastal natives are fine well-built fellows,
many of them over six feet in height.
The tablelanders have so far given the settlers no trouble, but
the coast natives are bloodthirsty and treacherous, and much given
to killing the horses and cattle.
Descending from the tableland we entered the South Australian
Valley, so named by the discoverer, Mr. Favenc, than which it
would be difficult to find a prettier or better bit of country any-
where?an undulating country of the finest soil, clothed with all


North Australias best grasses and herbs, hemmed in by a bold and
broken mountainous country through which flow streams of water.
After we left this valley the country became less rich in its
grasses, though still very good, and permanently watered by
springs in low hills of crystalline limestone. The vegetation
becomes more tropical. Cotton trees, with their large yellow
flower and green pods on leafless branches, being a notable
feature.
Again the country becomes more level with spurs of rocky but
well grassed hills jutting out into the valley of the McArthur river
down which we were travelling. Sandstone and limestone are the
principal rocks. A very broken range borders the valley on both
sides; very fine timber of many useful varieties abound, and the
grasses remain good right through to Borroloola, which is
a picturesquely situated township at the head of the salt waters on
the McArthur river.
I believe this coastal range will be found to contain gold and
other minerals. Limestone is the bedrock in the McArthur river
about twelve miles above the township.
By the foregoing you will see that from Lake Nash to Borroloola
on the sea coast, and across to the telegraph line we have an
immense tract of extremely valuable pastoral country, fairly and
well watered, clothed with the best of grasses, and as its soil is of
the finest, and its rainfall from 20 inches to 50 or 60 inches it
must be also suited for the production of many sub-tropical and
tropical products.
Arnhem?s Land Explorations in 1883.
Anaheim?s Land is the northern portion of the Northern Perri-
tory. .
The western portion, on which our settlements are situated, is
of course well known, but the central and eastern portion Avas
explored by me for the S; A. GoA r ernment in 1883, and a feiv
general remarks may be of interest.
A sandstone tableland, rising to a height of at least 1,200 ft.
above sea-level, lies north and south right across the centre of
Arnheim?s Land. From this tableland Aoav out rivers to the north,
south, east, and west ?the South and Last Alligators ; the Mary
river, which was discoA r ered and travelled down by Stuart though
he mistook it for the Adelaide river?in his memorable journey
across the continent in 1860; the Katherine, the sources ot which
Avere discovered by one of Australia s earliest and biavest
explorers, Dr. Leichardt, in 1845 ; the Whterhouse and Chambers,
Avhich, joining the Boper, help to make that eA r erflowing river one
of the finest in Australia. It may be considered the southern
boundary of Arnheim Land. Permanent springs in a limestone
and basaltic country send forth a large volume of Avater, which
Avinds its tortuous Avay through a most magnificent agricultural and


pastoral country, composed of downs and plains densely clothed
with most luxuriant grasses and herbs. It is navigable for ninety
miles, where a 500-ton vessel can lie in fresh water and discharge
its cargo direct on to the banks. The Cadell and Liverpool rivers
flowing into the north coast.
The tableland, which is but a narrow belt, has springs right on
top of it, and numerous springs give rise to many overflowing
creeks which wind their crystal way through deep ravines and
gorges on to the valleys and plains lying from 200 ft. to 500 ft.
beneath ; when, alternately flowing over pebbly beds and deep still
ponds covered with beautiful flowering nymphea or lilies, they form
the rivers which flow through well-grassed country to the sea.
It is evident that these springs and the heavy rains of centuries
have denuded the rocks, thus cutting up this central plateau into
gorges and ravines, which make it one of the most inaccessible and
difficult regions in Australia over which to travel.
We, coming from the eastward, struck the Liverpool river about
twenty miles in a direct line from the coast, where the country was
very suitable for agriculture. We proceeded to follow up the broad
white sandy bed in which was a stream of water not always showing
on the surface, through a country over which hills and huge piles
of sandstone were scattered, crossing at times good valleys with
granite and diorite hills. We at last found ourselves at the foot of
a frowning wall of rock 200 or more feet high, and extending as far
as we could see many miles on both sides of us, broken by
numerous creeks and ravines full of great sandstone boulders. The
river came through a gorge with perpendicular walls rising up out
of very clear deep water and then flowed over a level rocky shelf
worn by the water into hundreds of circular holes, between which
with difficulty we led our horses.
Zigzagging up the face of these cliffs we passed through and
over places which it would have been impossible to descend.
So frightfully rough and broken was this country that in eight
days we only made ten miles, and before we descended into the
valley of the Katherine we had lost twelve horses. This moun-
tainous region can scarcely be termed a tableland, but rather a
mass of hills of equal height whose flat tops and perpendicular
sides are covered with pillars and slabs of sandstone and horizontal
stratification cut and worn into the most fantastic shapes, and the
ravines filled with great boulders, forming a picturesque and wild
scene rarely to be met with in Australia.
The Liverpool river descends through this country in a series of
waterfalls. One was 50ft. in height, while at another point we
stood upon an overhanging ledge of rock with the water deep and
dark 200 ft. beneath us, rushing between two perpendicular walls
200 ft. apart, and sweeping round a terribly broken cliff whose
interstices were filled with beautiful green tropical vegetation ;
while up the stream we could see seven distinct waterfalls from
sft. to 50ft. in height.


Dr. Leichardt?s description of the tableland where he crossed it
much further south is graphic and worth repeating From one
of the hills I had a most disheartening, sickly view over a tre-
mendously rocky country. A high land composed of horizontal
strata of sandstone seemed to be literally hashed, leaving the
remaining blocks in fantastic figures of every shape, and a green
vegetation crowding deceitfully within their fissures and gullies and
covering half of the difficulties which awaited us in our attempt to
travel over it.?
The famed geologist. Rev. J. E. Tenison Woods, made an examina-
tion of the western portion of Arnheim?s Land last year, and has
objected to the plateau being called desert sandstone, as, on exami-
nation, he found many of the cliffs to be formed of belts of granite
at the base. Waterworn quartz conglomerate ferruginous magnesian
sandstone ?pure white magnesite ?in some places a highly
ferruginous sandstone horizontally stratified. It would therefore
appear, he says, that the so-called desert sandstone is confined to
numerous small patches of a newer formation of moderate thickness
which does not cover the older rocks to any great extent.?
The eastern division of Arnheim?s Land has two or three main
ranges, whose peaks reach an altitude of about 1,500 ft. sea-
level, with many hills and small ranges, making it a mountainous
country, in which are found many extensive valleys clothed with all
our best grasses and well timbered.
The coast is low, and in may parts covered by a dense low scrub
extending back ten miles or more, whilst in many places, as at the
bottom of Blue Mud Bay, extensive and magnificently grassed
plains run down to the mangroves bordering the coast, and are
backed by an exceedingly well grassed open forest country.
Limestone, basalt, sandstone, quartz, ironstone conglomerate, and
quartzite. Many important creeks and rivers were found, the
principal being the Walker, which, though navigable but a few
miles, is a running stream for eighty miles in its course through a
very good country. The Goyder, down which I travelled for
about eighty miles, is a magnificent stream, running so rapidly
that at one place the miniature waves, caused by the rocky bottom,
are breaking backwards into foam. It is navigable for twenty or
thirty miles, and flows through a magnificent country, plains of
alluvial soil stretching away back to the jungle-capped freestone
ranges, and covered by a dense growth of grasses; springs
and beautiful lagoons, swarming with wildfowl and full of fish,
fringed with the most luxuriant tropical vegetation to be seen in the
Northern Territory. Jungles of noble Leichardt pines and beautiful
fan palms, from 20ft. to 40ft. high, 2ft. to 3ft. diameter, with leaves
7ft. across. This river is destined at some future date to carry a
large agricultural population, and will be the most important outlet
for Eastern Arnheim?s Land. The natives were very numerous and
hostile. We suffered considerably from their aggressions, as at


one place they speared four horses, at another drove the horses
away for many miles, and a force of about 300 armed men attacked
us. Fortunately we drove them off without any injury to ourselves.
Dr. Leichardt, in his journal, speaking of the South Alligator
river, says, ? here there are more natives to the square mile than
in any other part of Australia.?
They subsist entirely upon natural products, and wander from
place to place, at certain periods of the year, after particular kinds
of food in its proper season. Portions of the country are conserved
for two or three years to allow the game and reptiles to increase.
Then, about August, a tribe will visit the spot, and by setting fire
to the grass in patches will find abundance of food. On occasions
of this sort I have frequently met a blackfellow with over a dozen
snakes around his neck.
Their only shelter or protection from the heavy rains is composed
of a few sheets of bark laid upon a low framework of bamboo or
some supple jungle plant. Sometimes a break wind, to keep off
the cold south-east wind, is constructed of boughs and bushes. I
once met with a solitary mia-mia formed of bamboos thickly
thatched with grass, 6ft. high, 10ft. diameter, and with but one
entrance, which was so small that I had the greatest difficulty in
squeezing through it. This was on a low mound in swampy
country, and the natives told me that when occupied, the entrance
was stopped up with grass to keep out the mosquitoes. It was
only used at the beginning of the wet season when the natives were
gathering wild fowl?s eggs, and as a stopping-place on the route
from one river to another during the wet season.
They have no clothing whatever, but a small piece of bark, about
the size of a man?s hand, attached to a belt, sometimes worn by the
young women, and a pendant of twisted fibre by the young men.
Their ornaments are armlets, bracelets, necklaces, and forehead
bands, made of grass, and decorated with feathers and kangaroo
and alligator?s teeth, belts of bark and women?s hair, bunches of
cockatoo feathers on the head. They paint themselves with various
colored clays, have some interesting ceremonies, and are very
superstitious. The dead bodies are placed upon a framework of
saplings, or up in the branches of a tree, where they are left until
the flesh has all disappeared, when the bones are removed and
buried in small circular mounds in some retired spot not far from
water, or wrapped in folds of paper bark and deposited in clefts of
rock high up in the face of a cliff'.
Some of the tribes, at the death of a chief, kill his wives and
bury them alongside the framework on which his body is placed.
Around the woman?s grave are placed the implements of the chase,
so that she may, in the spirit world, be ready to provide food for
her lord when he should call upon her to do so.
Polygamy is practised, and an interesting custom therewith is
that the old men have the young women and the young men have


the old women. This is a wise arrangement, as the old of both
sexes have young partners to provide them with food.
They are tall, straight, and well formed, straight hair, and scanty
whiskers. I have measured some men over 6ft. Sin. high. The
women are, when young, quite well formed, and often attractive and
good looking, with regular features, fine eyes, and always good teeth.
A strong sense of the humorous is often shown in their witty
replies add comical sayings.
They are cowardly and treacherous, but can he civilised to a
great extent, as is proved by the Port Essington tribe, amongst
whom to this day may be seen effects of the teachings of the
English soldiers in 1838-49.
Some of the tribes practise circumcision.
A curious legend is told on the north coast, somewhat as
follows ;?The natives say that at one time the country extended
far away towards the equator, connecting with land of the Malays ;
that a great fire gained possession of the whole country, and then
the waters came surging down, putting out this fire, cutting off and
Avashing aAvay a great deal of land. The fire is said to be still
burning, that tAvo or three men are told off to keep it alight, as
should it by any neglect become extinguished great evil will result.
On inquiring along the coast I AA'as alw r ays told that this small file
Avas kept alight by the next tribe. The cliffs on the coast present
a red and burnt like appearance.
Some of the tribes have suffered from smallpox, introduced they
say by the Malays, Avho for hundreds of years have frequented our
coast for trepang and pearlshell.
Rude draAvings of animals, human beings, and Aveapons, are to
be found on the cliffs and in caA'es.
The transmission of important news is very Avonderful. The
neAvs of the murder of a Avhite man Avas conveyed over 200 miles in
less than tAventy-four hours.
Their Aveapons are the spear and the tomahaAvk and the club.
They do not use the boomerang. They manufacture very good
rope and string out of fibre plants. Baskets are Avoven so closely
as to be watertight. Their canoes are of bark.
And noAV I might be permitted to, in a feAV sentences, take a
glance right through the Northern Territory.
Our southern boundary is the 26th parallel of south latitude,
Avhere the average annual rainfall is and betAveen here and
latitude 21� 30', a distance of 300 miles, Avhere the rainfall has
increased to 15jin., there is a great deal of waste sandy, desert
country, into which the backbone of Australia ?the MacDonnell
Ranges, reaching an altitude of, according to Mr. Winnecke, over
5,000 feet?has pushed its good pastoral country. Numerous
permanent springs and underground rivers Avill enable this centre
of Australia to support large herds of cattle and horses ; and Avhen
the transcontinental railway?Avhich I hope to see pushed across to


Port Darwin?reaches this far, vast flocks of sheep will prove this
to he a very valuable district. The climate is almost perfect.
Proceeding northwards, the rainfall increases by about 2in. for
every 100 miles, until we touch the coast range in about latitude
16�, where the rainfall is 31 in.?pre-eminently a pastoral country,
but also in many parts suitable for agriculture, with a climate
sufficiently cold to successfully produce wool. I therefore hope
and expect to see the time when the sheep of the Northern Terri-
tory, instead of being counted by tens of thousands, will be counted
by millions. As we near the coast the rainfall rapidly increases to
considerably over 60in.
Our coast country, with its numerous splendid rivers flowing
through immense plains of rich alluvial soil, point to the inevitable
conclusion that tropical agriculture will at no distant date be a
most important element in our national prosperity; while its
known metalliferous fields, said by a competent authority to be of
such exceptional richness, together with the. new ones which will
be found to exist in Arnheim?s Land in the eastern coastal ranges
and in the central ranges of the continent?gold, silver, copper,
and tin have already been discovered in the MacDonnell Ranges?
must prove remunerative fields for the investment of capital.
Thus we have a country capable of supporting hundreds of
thousands of cattle and horses, and millions of sheep; extensive
agricultural areas which will produce sugar, rice, coffee, cotton, and
nearly all other tropical and sub-tropical products necessary for our
use; and the wmnderful mineral wealth of gold, silver, tin, and
copper, all combined, will make the somewhat despised Northern
Territory of vast importance, and place it in the front rank of the
Australian States.
