THE KING’S MESSAGE.
“The signing of the Treaty of Peace will be received
with deep thankfulness throughout the British Empire.
“This formal act brings to its concluding stages the
terrible war which has devastated Europe and distracted
the world.
“It manifests the victory of the ideals of freedom and
liberty for which we have made untold sacrifices.
“I share my people’s joy and thanksgiving, and earn-
estly pray that the coming years of peace may bring to
them ever-increasing happiness and prosperity.”
The War resulted in 8,500,000 Men being killed.


Introduction.
Peace!
It is almost impossible for us to appreciate the magnitude
of its meaning. In the past five years there have been so many
catastrophes, so many passages from anxiety to confidence, from
gloom to exultation, that the human mind has lost its sense of
proportion.
Peace! But this much we know, Australia takes her place
among the nations, and those nations rejoice.
Peace! to Germany—transition from that summit of power
to the impotence of to-day, a supreme instance in history of the
fate of which overweening arrogance prepares for itself. Ger-
many’s character was irrepressible. The war became a test of
the instinct of mankind for freedom and justice.
But now the war-drums throb no longer, the world breathes
freedom, and markedly notes that from all the five years’ welter
of carnage—Australia is a nation. A nation born on the gory
heights of Gallipoli that April morning when the name Anzac was
wafted from billow to billow, and reached the corners of the earth.
A dramatic debut of a young, untried, and practically unknown
nation, which amazed the critics of war. It was a day of bap-
tism and* regeneration, awakening and fulness of life. That day our
soldiers placed Australia on the map—they did more; they made
a name so remarkable and aroused such expectation, that few
Armies could have lived up to it. But, on the fields of France
and elsewhere, the diggers—an Army of mates —not only upheld
that name, but added greater lustre. Australians of generations
to come will recall the war with pride. The doings of our men will
be an everlasting tradition —an everlasting inspiration.
But. with quickening pulses, amid all our rejoicings in these
times of Peace and songs of Victory, there comes to us the solemn
memory of the fallen. There is a look in the eyes of those who
have lost dear ones, and for an instant the wings of Death rustle
softly overhead. We see those who are returned to us: many are
halt and maimed; to many the full joys of lusty manhood must
ever be denied. They do not ask for pity; they turn and bid you
share their gratitude and pride and do honor to the martyrs of the
Great Cause. Then you realise that although monster guns, tanks, and
other scientific devices be the paper money of war, the bedrock
gold of barter, is still man’s life. The guns counted much—but
the man counted more. And, as you look around at the bunting,
the decorations, and hear the shrieks of joy, in celebration of Peace,
you realise that they who died are part of the price. They died as
martyrs for their peoples, died that we might be free, died as a
supreme proof that as long as our land breed such sons, no man
shall set upon us the mark of any vassalage.

The War Cost Australia nearly 60,000 lives, of which
nearly 21,000 New South Wales Boys paid the
Supreme Sacrifice.

ITALY’S BIG FOUR
WORLD BEATERS. EVERY ONE!
Here are four preparations from the famous Italian firm of Chiozza & Turchi, of Pontela-
goscuro, Italy—right in the heart of Italy’s Olive groves. 100 years’ experience is behind
each line—guaranteeing supreme quality, purity and economy.
SALUTIS.
The Medicinal Soap.
is a pure Olive Oil soap blended with
rare and valuable balms and oils which
make Salutis a most valuable skin and
hair soap. Combined with Salutis Oint-
ment, Salutis Soap will relieve and cure
many stubborn skin diseases.
SAVON CHRYSANTEME.
For the Toilet,
Like Salutis, it contains much Olive
Oil, and is perfectly matured.
This Soap has the most exquisite per-
fume of any toilet soap.
Savon Chrysanteroe possesses a most
delightful perfume—that of real Italian
Chrysanthemums. The perfume lingers
on the skin for hours and sometimes for
days. It is excellent for placing in a
linen chest, as the perfume clings, yet
is neither overpowering nor obtrusive.
SALUTIS SHAVING CREAM.
For Men Who Care.
Salutis Shaving Cream is a high-grade
Italian preparation packed in large screw-
cap tubes. It lathers freely in hot or
cold water, does not dry on the face, and
does not sting or irritate the skin. It
softens the hair to such an extent that
there is no need to rub this cream in—
the olive oil does the work.
ri**c
CASTILE SOAP No. 4.
The ONLY Soap for the Baby.
Guaranteed under the Pure Food Act of
N.S.W.
To conform with the regulations of the
N.S.W. Pure Food Act, Castile No. 4
Soap has been made with an exception-
ally high percentage of pure Italian Olive
Oil. It contains no injurious alkalis, and
has no perfume. We specially recommend
it for Nursery and Sick-room use —its
extreme purity guaranteeing that it will
not sting or irritate the most sensitive
skin.
Insist upon getting Genuine Castile No.
4 Soap. There are many imitations sold
under various disguises, but only soaps
marked CASTILE No. 4 and guaranteed
under the Pure Food Act are genuine.
Ask for and insist upon getting
CASTILE No. 4 —made in Italy.
SPECIAL To commemorate the signing of the Peace Treaty, a liberal
sample of Salutis, Savon Chrysanteme, and Castile No. 4 Soap
PEACE and Salutis Shaving Cream will be sent FREE to any address
on receipt of 6d. in stamps to cover postage. Send full adi

While we greet you with our love.

And the blood-bought cliffs are sheer:

Though strange grasses wave about you,
