    "# Harvesting the text of digitised books (and ephemera)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook harvests metadata and OCRd text from digitised books in Trove. There's three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Harvest metadata of digitised books using the Trove API\n",
    "* Extract the number of pages for each book from the Trove web interface (the number of pages is necessary to download the OCRd text)\n",
    "* Download the OCRd text for each book\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not easy to identify all the digitised books with OCRd text in Trove. I'm starting with a [search in the book zone](https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/books?keyword=%22nla.obj%22&l-availability=y&l-format=Book) for books that include the phrase `\"nla.obj\"` and are available online. This currently returns 57,046 results in the web interface. In amongst these are a range of government papers and reports, as well as publications where access to the digital copy is restricted. I think these are mostly recent books submitted in digital form under legal deposit. Things are made even more confusing by the fact that the contents of the 'Books & libraries' category in the web interface is not the same as the API's books zone. Anyway, I've used the new `fullTextInd` index to try and filter out works without any OCRd text and added `NOT format:\"Government publication\"` to the search query to try and filter out the government publications. The government publications are split across the journals and books zone, so I think I'll try and do a separate harvest that brings them all together. These extra parameters currently reduce the total results to 32,149 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "But some of those 32,149 results are actually parent records that contain multiple volumes or parts. When I find the number of pages in each book, I'm also checking to see if the record is a 'Multi volume book' and has child works. If it does, I add the child works to the list of books. After this stage there are 33,505 works. However, not all of these 33,505 records have OCRd text. Parent records of multi volume works, and ebook formats like PDFs or MOBI, don't have individual pages, and therefore don't have any text to download. If we exclude works without pages, there are 27,367 works that might have some OCRd text to download.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading all the OCRd text files (ignoring any that were empty) I ended up with a grand total of **24,620 files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you compare the number of downloaded files to the number in the CSV file that are identified as having OCRd text you'll notice a difference – 24,620 compared to 27,367. After a bit more poking around I realised that there are some duplicates in the list of works. This seems to be because more than one Trove metadata record can point to the same digitised work. For example, both [this record](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/192090169) and [this record](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/31771096) point to [this digitised work](http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-1874683). As they're not exact duplicates, I've left them in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking through the downloaded text files, it's clear that we're getting ephemera (particularly pamphlets and posters) as well as books. There doesn't seem to be an obvious way to filter these out up front, but of course you could filter later by the number of pages. It's also obvious we didn't manage to exclude all the government publications – not sure how to deal with these either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the metadata I've harvested in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [CSV formatted file with details of digitised books](trove_digitised_books_with_ocr.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `children` – pipe-separated ids of any child works\n",
    "* `contributors` – pipe-separated names of contributors\n",
    "* `date` – publication date\n",
    "* `form` – work format\n",
    "* `fulltext_url` – link to the digitised version\n",
    "* `language` – main language of the work\n",
    "* `pages` – number of pages\n",
    "* `parent` – id of parent work (if any)\n",
    "* `rights` – copyright status\n",
    "* `text_downloaded` – file name of the downloaded OCR text\n",
    "* `text_file` – True/False is there any OCRd text\n",
    "* `title` – title of the work\n",
    "* `trove_id` – unique identifier\n",
    "* `url` – link to the metadata record in Trove\n",
    "* `volume` – volume/part number\n",
